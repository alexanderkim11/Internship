A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by
are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY,
MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family
employees. A "30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY" sign hangs in the
background.
BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying
to place a large segment of wayward hair.

          Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong.
          This is a bad sign.
               
          We really need to get a make-up
          person?!
The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over.

          Not in the budget. And not to                         *

          worry, you're going to look great
          in this.
She holds out a HAIR NET.

          A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair
          net. I just did the hair.

               
          Health code. In the kitchen or
          around the cookie, you gotta have
          it.

               
          You guy's should tell me this
          before hand, this is like a huge
          waste of...moose.
Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up
looking ridiculous and very disgruntled.

          Remind me to swing by an elementary                   *
          school after this and serve lunch.
Ally laughs.






          You're a thing of beauty.     In
          three, two, one. . .
Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman.
(Note: Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
"REPORTER'S VOICE" - that recognizable, too-smooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have. In mathematical terms
Bruce's version is to the 7th power.)

          For three decades the Kowolski
          Family Bakery has been a mainstay
          in downtown Buffalo. Known for
          their sinfully rich, cream filled,
          deep fried polski pierogis. And
          the occasional sugar induced coma
          that follows. Today, in honor of
          their 30 year anniversary, Momma
          Kowolski and her sons Gustov and
          Vol, decided to do something, a
          little bit different. Tell me
          guys, how did this idea come about?


          Well,    Vol said to me, 'Gustov, why
          don't    we make the biggest chocolate
          chip    cookie in Buffalo?' And I
          said,    'Yeah, sure.'

          Wow. Fascinating.
Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE.

          The previous Buffalo cookie record
          was 3 feet, 17 inches baked by
          Gladys Pelsnick. But this behemoth
          cookie clearly proving that Gustov
          and Vol have much more free time.
The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background,
toasting with big mugs of milk. Bruce steps forward, looks
dramatically at camera, slow zoom in as he speaks.

          As we witness the ceremonial
          toasting with milk it makes one
          pause and think. What are we
          really looking at here?





          Is it just a big cookie or does
          this cookie represent the pride of
          Buffalo? Our dedicated and hard
          working citizens the key
          ingredient, with a few nuts thrown
          in.
              (motions his eyes to the
               Kowolski twins)
          And finally, the love of our
          families which provides the warm
          chewy center making our beloved
          Buffalo the sweetest place to live.

Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off.

          And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles. I'm Bruce Nolan,
          Eyewitness News.
Bruce's hair net SLIPS UP, PUFFING HIS HAIR INTO A BUN ON THE
TOP OF HIS HEAD. The Kowolskis and bystanders all laugh.
The frame FREEZES.
We PULL BACK from the TV and find Bruce holding the remote,
watching the recorded spot on TV. We are now...


Bruce is with his longtime girlfriend, GRACE. She has a box
of photos on the coffee table in front of her organizing them
into a photo album.

          So, what do you think?

          It's good.

          It sucks. It's a story about a
          cookie. People with eating
          disorders will be riveted,
               (goes into huge pathetic
                fan character)
          Dear Bruce, love the bakery piece.
          I can't wait to vomit so I can make
          room for more cookies.

          I thought it was funny. I love the
          hair net. How'd you get it to do
          that?






          What? I'm cutting that. They made
          me wear that stupid thing. I don't
          even look like myself. The hair is
          one of the most important parts of
          an on camera persona. Right out of
          the gate, I lost the hair
          advantage.
Grace looks at a photo,

          Oh, my gosh, look at this one. My
          sister is so drunk.
She places it in the album.

          Grace. Try to stay focused here.
          I need your help.

          Aren't you taking this a little too
          seriously?

           It's sweeps Grace. It is serious.
           There's an anchor job open. This
           is important. This is our future!
Bruce points to the TV as he says "future," not realizing
he's pointing at the ridiculous image of himself with the
hair net bun. Grace can't help but giggle.

           I'm sorry.
Bruce collapses into Grace's arms like a child. He clearly
has a fragile temperament.

               
          I'm never going to get anchor doing
          these kind of assignments. I want
          my work to matter.

          It does matter. You're funny. You
          make people smile. Come on, take a
          break, help me put this album
          together.


               
          Alright.
Grace holds up a photo.

          Oh look at this. It's the first
          day we moved in together.
It's the two of them, younger, laughing.

               
          Yeah, so full of hopes and dreams.

          Oh, here's me at my sister's
          wedding. I caught the bouquet.
It's a picture of Grace overpowering the other bridesmaids
for the bouquet.

          You look pretty intense, hun.

          Well, I was thinking about you.
Grace cuddles into Bruce.

          So, you're attracted to me in some
          way, is that what you're trying to
          say?
Grace rolls over onto Bruce.

          You have no idea.

          I was saving myself for the wedding
          night, but if you keep this up, I
          may lose my resolve.
Grace stands, pulling Bruce up.

          Well, that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
They kiss, stumbling toward the bedroom.






            Hey, that's a good line, but you
            need more resonance. From the
            diaphragm.
                
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.

            Oh, say it again.

                
            That's the way the cookie crumbles.

                
            Oh, I just love on-air
            personalities.

                 
            Well then, let me take these
            clothes off and slip into my hair
            net.
Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the
bedroom.



We see the INTRO FOR SIXTY MINUTES:


            I'm Ed Bradley, I'm Merely Safer,
            an d I ' m --
LESLIE STAHL is HIT IN THE NECK WITH A TRANQUILIZER DART.
Her head wavers, then DROPS on the desk. The camera PANS to
BRUCE, who lowers a bamboo blow gun, cooly addresses camera.

            ...Bruce Nolan. And this is Sixty
            Minutes.





We are in. . .







Bruce lies next to Grace with a big smile on his face. Grace
hits the alarm, rolls over snuggling close to Bruce.

          Sweety, time to get up...
She kisses Bruce, gets up.

          No, I'm having a great dream.
The covers are RIPPED OUT OF FRAME.   Bruce throws a mock
hissy fit.


Bruce watches TV as he buttons his shirt.

          ...and the Sabers lost another
          close one last night. Four to
          three to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

          Of course they lost, they're my
          team.



Bruce checks his hair in the mirror practicing his new sign-
off.

          "And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles."
               
          You know, I think there might be
          something to that cookie line.
          Everything great anchor has his own
          signature sign-off.
               
          "And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles."


Peeing in the corner on the carpet.





          Oh no!   Grace, the dog!

          I'm in the shower!

          Ah!

Bruce runs along carrying the peeing Sam with extended arms
dodges a man ascending the stares, who gets sprinkled.

          Whoops, sorry.

Bruce makes it outside, sets Sam down on the grass. Sam
looks up innocently at Bruce, finished.

          Oh, you're all done, huh?
          B-e-a-utiful.

Bruce pulls up in his Ford Tauras to a cluster of cars
unloading kids. A 2003 MERCEDES SRL passes by.

          Wow, nice car, huh?

          Yeah, if you want to rub your
          success in people's faces.
Then Bruce notices a big medical van in front of the school
with a BLOOD DRIVE SIGN.

          What's with the hubbub?

          We're having a blood drive.

          Creepy. Needles, yech...

          Oh, that's a nice response.






          I mean, it's just s o . . .

          Helpful and life saving?

          C'mon, that's your...blood. It's
          in your body and I don't think it's
          supposed to come out. Besides,
          they stockpile that stuff. They
          have an endless supply frozen in a
          warehouse somewhere then tell
          everyone there's a shortage.


          They do not. Now stop it. I'm                        *
          giving. I have a very rare blood                     *
          type, AB positive.

          Well, I'm IB positive. IB positive
          they aint touchin' me with no
          needle.
Grace sighs in exasperation, starts out when...

                (suddenly remembers
                 something)

          h
She places a STRING OF PRAYER BEADS on the rearview mirror.

          What's that?

          Prayer beads. The kids made 'em.
          Keep you safe.

          Well, I hope they work, cause it's
          going take a miracle to get me to
          work on time.

Bruce is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic. He stares at the
prayer beads with a "thanks alot" look.





A big accident ahead. Bruce looks at his watch, he's
screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is
oblivious.

             This is just my luck.
Bruce's BEEPER sounds.      He checks it.

             The meeting's starting, perfect...
                  
             Screw it.
He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels
off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars.

                 
             Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's
             kill or be killed, only the strong
             survive, no guts, no glory1

Bruce pulls over, fumes.

                  
             Thank you.

Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping
over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS
MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign
boards. The various "warnings" change daily. Today's SIGN
reads:

Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.

Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs
right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY.





          Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy.
          Don't even move, I got somethin'
          special today. My mom made it just
          for you.

          Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go-
          I'm late...

               
          You like Quiche?
He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche.

          You know, contrary to popular
          belief the quiche was actually
          invented by the Mayans, then stolen
          by the French. They shoulda said,
          "Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's
          Mayan!"
Bobby belts out a laugh.

          Bobby, I can't, I--

          Just taste it, taste it...
Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking
it with exasperation.

          Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go.

          That's a buck seventy-five.

          Can you get Kelly- Ahh...
Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for
cash.

               
          Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o-
          five, two-ten...





Bruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy
anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room.

          Way out of our league, huh?
Bruce offers his money to Bobby.

          You know, I saw them editing your
          cookie piece.


          Really?


          They must have gotten high or
          something, cause they was orderin'
          everything, I had. Hey, how long
          have you been interested in pastry?
          'Cause I've got an aunt who makes
          baklava twenty layers deep.


               
          Bobby.

               
          Maybe you could do a story on her!
Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off.

          Keep the change.

               
          I'll give her a call, we'll talk
          about it later!





          Is something killing your kids?
          Find out tonight at eleven.
Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then
continues on.






The morning meeting is well in progress. Leading the group
is the station manager and Bruce's boss, JACK KELLER, 50's, a
constant furrow in his brow.
Also in the room: Bruce's fellow field reporter and rival
EVAN BAXTER, 30' s , a walking statement. Impeccable posture,
perfect speech, perfect everything and he knows it.
FRED DONOHUE, the ever jovial sports reporter; always tanned,
vain weatherman, DALLAS COLEMAN and segment producer Ally
Loman.


          Okay, promos are approved, let's--

          Ah, isn't that last one a little
          misleading? I mean, the story's
          about flu shots. Do we have to
          scare people to death?

          No, just into watching. Or I could
          change it to: "Slow news day, come
          yawn with us. At eleven."

          Sniffles at eleven is nice.

          Attack of the killer sniffles?

              
          The tanning booth is starting to
          zap your brain, you know that?

          I don't use a tanning booth.
A beat and they all crack up.

          Come on. You're turning orange.                       *

          He looks Florida ripe to me.         .                *
More laughs.                                                    *






          I would have swore I already said
          this, but promos are approved. Now                  *
          can we move on?                                     *

          Jack, shouldn't the promos be                       *
          focusing on Pete's retirement.
          This is his last week.

              
          Yeah, yeah. Any word on the open
          anchor position, Jack?

          Evan, you'11 know something when I
          know something.
Bruce bursts into the room. The meeting stops. Jack doesn't
need to say anything, he just looks at his watch.

          Sorry, Jack. It wasn't my fault.
          The traffic was -- You guys already
          played the spots?

          Nice story, Bruce, but we're going
          with Evan's piece on the sex
          scandal at the mayor's office for
          sweeps.
This hits Bruce hard. A beat of silence.

          And that's the way the cookie
          crumbles.
The others chuckle. Only Ally remains sympathetic.

          I'm just messin' with you, Bruce.
          See you've got to remember that the
          news room is like a cookie...
More laughs.

               (re: Evan's perfect
                posture)
          That's great Evan.




                    BRUCE 
          Is you're posture naturally that
          good, or do you have to shove a
          stick up there?

          Okay, knock it off... Bruce we're
          holding your story in reserve.
          Now, can we get back to the board
          so we have something to air today?
Jack continues with assignments. Evan sits smugly, as Bruce
slides down into his chair, deflated.


Jack is at Bobby's cart, paying for a sandwich. Bruce
catches up .to him.

          Jack, Jack, hey.     Can I talk to you
          for a second?

          Sure, Bruce. What do you need?

          Sweeps.
Jack takes his sandwich and leaves. Bobby leans to Bruce.

          Don't worry about it.    I called my
          aunt, we're on.
Bruce looks at Bobby, continues after and catches Jack.

          Look, Jack. Hear me out, I'm
          getting desperate man, I am pushing
          forty and what have I got to show
          for it? The point is, I've hit
          some kind of a ceiling here. Some
          kind of anti-Bruce barrierI And
          Evan is just lovin' it, by the way.
          He gets the good stories, he gets
          on sweeps. Maybe I have to be more
          like Evan.


          You don't want to be like Evan.
          Evan's an asshole.

          I can be an asshole.






             No, Bruce.     You can't.
Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It
scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other
for a beat.

             Are you going to pick that up?

             Yeah, I'm sorry.
Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food.

             It's just- this anchor position
             looming, it's gotten me nuts...
He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA
saunters by.

Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan.

             Hi, Jack.
Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing.

             Look, Bruce. You're a good
             reporter. You make people laugh.
             God knows today we can use it.
Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before.              *

                 
             Alright, tell you what. It's the                   *
             23rd anniversary of the Maid of the
             Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls
             in an hour.

             Maid of the Mist. That's always
             live.

             Yep.

             Evan gets the live feeds.






          Well now you and Evan get the live
          feeds.

          I'm going live. In sweeps.

          Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce.
          I've seen your outtakes.
Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest.

          Yes 1 You will not regret this,
          Jack.
               
          I will not forget you when I go
          national.
Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his
chest. We hear children's joyous SHRIEKS...


A COUPLE DOZEN KIDS playing at Grace's self-starter business,
a one room day care center filled with children and toys.
Grace turns, reacts.

          Martin, are you eating the glitter
          again?

He shakes his head "no."


          Martin. Open your mouth. Abra su
          boca.
He does. His tongue sparkles with glitter.

          Oh, you're not huh? Well, then
          you've got a bad case of Liberace.
Grace's sister, Debbie, enters. She's wearing a nurse's
outfit. Her youngest, ZOE, 3, runs over to greet her.

          They didn't teach you Spanish in
          nursing school, did they?

          Well, it seemed like they were
          speaking a foreign language
          sometimes, but no. Problemo?

          Martin has decided to explore new
          food groups.
               
          Martin, this is for art. Like this.
She spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter.

          Is it so wrong to tie them up?

          D eb -- Ma rt i n!
Martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth.
Grace snatches it.

          Okay, go rinse your mouth with
          water. Lave su boca. Go.
               
          I swear that kid is going to poop

          Free milk cow.

The phone RINGS.

          me, will you?
Debbie does.

          Small Wonders Day Care.

Bruce is on his cell phone, while the NEWS CREW races around,
setting up for the report. The FALLS ROAR behind him and the
Mate of the Mist sightseeing boat is in the b.g.

          Grace?

Grace GRABS THE PHONE.


              
          What?

          Sorry, honey. My sister seems to
          think she's my mother. Where are
          you?

              
          Oh, A little place called the

          doing a "live" report.

          Live? That's greatI

          Yep, it's happenin', hun. I got
          sweeps and I'm live. You know what
          that means?




                    BRUCE 
          They're seeing if I can think on my
          feet, like you might have to do in
          a live news anchor situation.

          Oh, my gosh.

          This is happening for us, Grace.
          What we've always talked about.
          Jack practically came out and told
          me.
Grace quickly switches gears.   She experienced the premature-
celebration before.

          Wait, what do you mean practically?

          Well, he didn't spell it out, but
          this is exactly what happened to
          Susan Ortega right before she was
          bumped up to the desk.

              
          I just want to make sure we're not
          getting too ahead of ourselves.

          I totally agree, but in the mean
          time you should start thinking
          about what coast you want to live
          on.
Ally interrupts, indicating the time.

          Oh, they're calling me, I gotta go.

          Good luck, honey. I love you.                          *

Ally hustles Bruce toward the bow of the boat, as he places
his ear piece.

          They want you close to the falls.

          What for? I'll get soaked.

          That's the point.    They want you to
          hold up this.
She hands Bruce a very stupid looking, blue "falls" shaped
UMBRELLA with the MAID OF THE MIST INSIGNIA.

          Part of the condition of us getting
          the exclusive.
Bruce takes the umbrella.

          Lovely.    Glad I wore my tap shoes.

          Remember, this is their 23rd
          anniversary. Capacity is 59. They
          cater to tourists, honeymooners. . .

          And people who are insanely                    '     *
          thirsty, I get it.                                   *

          And you'll be interviewing Irene

She positions A VERY, VERY OLD WOMAN next to Bruce.

          ...She rode on the maiden voyage
          with her late husband. Okay, 90                      *
          seconds.
Bruce looks upward at the ridiculous umbrella. Mutters
encouragement to himself.






           90 seconds, going live. Think
           anchor, think dignity,
                (glances up toward
                 umbrella)
           Ignore umbrella. Just have fun.




Some of the CREW MEMBERS watch the feed.



Pete Fineman is reporting.

           ...but because of the fast response
           by our local fire fighters, the
           toxic chemicals were cleaned up
           without incident. Susan.
The female co-anchor, SUSAN ORTEGA:

           Bruce Nolan is standing by at
           Niagara Falls with a report on the
           Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat,
           but before we go live to Bruce, we
           have an announcement to make. As
           everyone knows, after 33 years, our
           beloved Pete Fineman is retiring.
Pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile.

           Pete's shoes are virtually
           impossible to fill, but the show
           must go on. And we could think of
           no one better than our very own
           Evan Baxter.


Listening to the feed. His FACE GOES WHITE.      He stands in
shock.
Evan is seated next to Susan.





          Congratulations, Evan. Looks like
          we'll be sitting side by side from
          now on.

          Thanks, Susan. I ' m thrilled and
          honored. Like you said, no one can
          replace the great Pete Fineman, but
          I'll do my best. I have to say I
          am so proud to be a part of our
          local community. Of Buffalo. I
          think a great city is a lot like a
          great recipe really. Put in some
          hard working citizens, add some
          care givers, maybe a few nuts...
The other news anchors and Evan himself chuckle at "his"
joke. Bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned.

          All sprinkled with the strength and
          love of our good families, that
          ultimately creates a sweet place to
          live. Thank you.

              
          Wow. That was amazing. And now
          let's go live to wacky Bruce Nolan
          out at Niagara Falls.

Bruce stands like a deer in headlights, drenched, holding the
ridiculous umbrella. Ally sig nals Bruce he's on. He stares
into camera, numb.

The kids are gone. Grace watches the TV with a few other
teachers. She's concerned.

          Talk honey, talk.

Jack rushes in, looking at Bruce on the monitor.

          What's going on?






          We've got a Walt Disney.


          Frozen solid.


          He may not have audio. Check his
          feed, have Susan cover.


Susan reacts to the message in her ear piece.


          We may be having a bit of technical
          difficulty...

Evan smiles in the background, clearly enjoying himself.




          Feed's good, Jack.


          Come on, Bruce, talk damn-it...
          Okay, get ready to pull the plug.


          Please baby, say something...



Like popping out of a coma, Bruce surges in. Surprisingly,
seems very up and fine.

          Thank you, Susan 1 Bruce Nolan here
          aboard the Maid of the Mist at
          Niagara falls.



          Thank you, God.







               
          Thank God.
Jack pats the Director's shoulder, heads out of the room.



          First off, "I want to add another
          congratulations to Evan Baxter.
          It's good to see what someone with
          real talent can accomplish when
          great opportunities are given to
          him instead of me.
               
          Anyway, I'm here, I believe with
          Katherine Hepburn's mom. Tell me,
          why did you toss the blue "heart of
          the ocean" jewel over the railing
          of Titanic?
The Old Woman doesn't know what to say.

          Did you feel guilty at all letting
          Leonardo Decaprio freeze, while you
          were safe floating on the big door?
          Do you think he would have survived
          if you had taken turns, or were you
          too afraid to freeze your big fat
          ass off?


Jack rockets back into the room.


          Did I just hear..?

          Well, I guess that's the way life
          works, isn't it? Some people are
          drenched, freezing to death, on a
          stupid boat, with a stupid
          umbrella...
               
          while others who aren't fit to kiss
          my willy, are sitting in a nice,
          comfy news room, sucking up all the
          glory111








          This isn't happening. This isn't
          happening...

Bruce takes off walking, the camera follows.

          Now, lets speak to the owner. Come
          on in here, Bill.
Bill shakes his head "NO" as Bruce pulls him into frame.

          Bill, you.'ve been running the Maid
          of the Mist for 23 years. Tell me,
          why do you think I didn't get the
          anchor job?

          Hey, man, I don't want any--

          Do you think it's my hair?
               (Bruce messes his hair
                like crazy)
          Maybe my teeth aren't white enough?
          Or like the great falls, is the
          bedrock of my life slowly erroding
          underneath me.
               (moving closer to camera,
                to an inch away)
          Erroding. Erroooding.
          Errodiiiing...

All work has stopped. Stunned staffers stare at the monitor.

Jack stands with his jaw dropped, snaps out of it.

          Alright, cut the feed! Cut to
          black if you have to.

          I'm on it.






Bruce is now licking the camera lens.    He steps back and
signs-off. Smooth as silk.

          I'm Bruce Nolan for Eyewitness
          news. Back to you fuckers 1

Susan Ortega stares frozen blankly into camera.



Bruce is TOSSED OUT THE FRONT DOORS, his box of possessions
spilling on the ground. Bruce FLAILS at the building.

Bruce carries his box to his car, when he HEARS A NOISE.
A street GANG is hassling the HOMELESS SIGN GUY. Pushing him
around, breaking and painting over his signs.
Instinctively, Bruce walks over.

          Hey, come on guys. What are you
          doin'? Just leave him alone.
They turn, look at Bruce, laugh and head off.    Bruce helps
the Sign Guy up, looks after the Gang.

          Yeah, you'd better keep walkin'.
They stop cold, turn back to Bruce and CHARGE AT HIM. Bruce
attempts to run, but they leap on him in a big dog pile,
swinging and kicking.
Bruce is left with a bloody lip, lying beside his car. We
hear the sound of smashing glass and scratching metal and the
gang running off. Bruce slowly gets up.
Reveal Bruce's car, WINDOW'S SMASHED, PAINT SCRAPED and the
word "HERO" KEY SCRATCHED ON THE DOOR.

          B-e-a-utiful.
               




                    BRUCE 
          Just what you get for trying to
          help someone.
Bruce gets in, pulls out of the parking lot passing the
Homeless Man who sits beaten up holding a scrawled out sign


          Get a clue, buddy.

Bruce is pacing, holding an ICE PACK to his swollen lip.

          Thank God you're alright.

          God, yeah. Let's thank God.
          Thanks for everything, Lord. I am
          so honored that my horrible demise
          is a part of your loving and
          mysterious plan.

          Bruce, don't talk like that.

          Oh, don't worry, he's not
          listening. If he is he doesn't
          care. Have you seen the news
          lately? We got gangs, we got
          drugs, we got corruption. What
          kind of God lets that happen?
          Every time we cure a disease he
          comes up with a new one!
              
          Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's
          God. They've just come up with a
          treatment for syphilis down there.
          I think it's time to release the
          tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a
          guy in Ohio who's praying for
          strength and wisdom, blind him and
          cut off his legs.

          So God is torturing us?

          Think about it, Grace. God is all-
          powerful . He could fix everything
          in five minutes if he wanted to.




                    BRUCE 
          But he doesn't want to. He doesn't
          like me.
Sam starts PEEING ON THE RUG.


          Oh, Perfect!
              
          But you're aim isn't so good, I'm
          over herel

          Bruce, please. This isn't his
          fault.

          Of course not.
              
          It's part of the mysterious plan.
Grace puts Sam outside. Returns, trying to calm Bruce.

          Honey, you're mad right now. It's
          understandable. And what Evan did
          was slimy and wrong. But your job
          doesn't matter to me. You matter
          to me. You could've really been
          hurt. I'm just glad you're okay.


          Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi
          And I'm not okay with the fact that
          you think everything is okay. I'm
          not okay with a mediocre job. I'm
          not okay with a mediocre apartment.
          I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE!
Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the

          Is that what you have, Bruce?
          A mediocre life? Well, I'm sorry
          for being a piece in your mediocre
          puzzle.

          Terrific. I'm drowning and you
          throw me a brick!
Grace starts to cry.






            Perfect! I'll have the worst day
            of my life with a side order of
            guilt, please. I-- I don't need
            this.
Bruce grabs his keys and heads out.


It's RAINING now. Bruce drives, going nowhere in particular.
His frustration is turning to desperation.

            Okay, God. You want me to talk to
            you? Then talk back. Tell me
            what's going on? What should I
            do? Give me a sign...
Bruce passes a BLINKING YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT, doesn't
notice. . .

            I'm right here. Speak to me.
A PEDESTRIAN stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of
the way.



Bruce is oblivious.

            All I need is some guidance.
            Please send me a signal.
A TRUCK TRANSPORTING VARIOUS ROAD SIGNS pulls in front of
Br uce . F our way s, bli nki ng. The va rie d s igns re ad: Yi eld ,
Wrong Way, Dead End, Do Not Enter, Stop.


            Oh well, I guess you don't care.
Bruce spots the PRAYER BEADS hanging on the rearview mirror.

            Okay, we'll do it your way.
                 (pulls the beads from the
                  mirror)
            Lord, I need a miracle. Please
            help me.





He hits a bump and the BEADS DROP TO THE FLOOR.        Bruce
reaches down, fishes for the beads...

           Come on, where'd you go?
                
           Ah ha! AHHH!
And BAM!11 BRUCE'S CAR SLAMS INTO A LIGHT POST.


Bruce stumbles out, surveys his demolished car, then looks at
the beads in his hands. He begins to laugh maniacally.
He spots the lake, starts running toward it like a madman,
HEAVES THE PRAYER BEADS INTO THE LAKE. He looks heavenward,
challenging the Infinite.

          Okay, if that's the way you want
          it. The gloves are off, pal! Let
          me see a little wrath! Smite me oh
          mighty smiteri What, no pestilence
          no boils? Come on, you got me on
          the ropes, don't you want to finish
          me off?! You're the one who should
          be fired! The only one around here
          not doing his job is YOU! What are
          we, you're little pet project? A
          hobby you tinker with now and
          again? Answer me. ANSWER ME!!!
A beat of silence then Bruce's BEEPER GOES OFF. He cynically
chuckles at the timing, checks it, sees 772-5623.

           Sorry, don't know you, wouldn't
           call you if I did.
Bruce walks off toward his wrecked car, it BEEPS AGAIN.



The BEEPING continues. We are in. . .



Bruce wakes, slaps at the alarm clock, groggy, reaches for
the phone, finally realizes it's the beeper. He gets up,
begrudgingly, checks it. The same number.






          Well, hello again 772-5623, don't
          hold your breath.
Bruce tosses the pager on the bed, heads for the bathroom.
The beeper BEEPS. Bruce stops in his tracks, turns, opens
the window, grabs the beeper and FIRES IT OUT. It SHATTERS
against a telephone pole. He calmly continues to the
bathroom.


A note is stuck in the bathroom mirror, with an old picture
of he and Grace in happier times. The note simply says:

Grace"

Peering over top of the note, Bruce sees Sam circling on the
rug.

          Oh, no.

Bruce runs down the stairs carrying the trickling, Sam.


Bruce sets Sam on the grass. Sam looks up, finished.

          What's the point?


Bruce walks over to the shattered beeper. He picks up a
small piece of it containing the LED read out: 772-5623















             Denied that promotion at work? Is
             life unfair? Everywhere you turn
             is there someone less talented than
             you reaping all the benefits ? Is
             your name Bruce? Then do we have
             the job for you. We're located at
             77256 23rd Street...
Bruce reaches for a pen, begins jotting down the address.

             So come on down, or we'll just keep
             beepin' ya.

An old building on the outskirts of town. A faded sign
painted on the wall reads, OMNI PRESENTS.
Bruce's demolished car enters frame.      He studies the area and
building suspiciously.
Bruce cautiously moves towards the structure and then, STEPS
IN A PUDDLE. He SINKS UP TO HIS KNEE.

             Perfect.
He gets out, shakes off his sopping leg, and heads inside.

Bruce enters and checks the BUILDING DIRECTORY.      It reads:


Pers onnel    Rm. 7
Ac coun ting Rm. 7
Security      Rm . 7
Creativ e     Rm. 7

             You're looking for room 7.
Bruce turns to see a JANITOR mopping the floor.     He looks at
Bruce's wet leg, offers the mop.

             Want me to even those up for you?





               
          How would I get to room 7?

          That'd be on the seventh floor.
          Stairs are right over there.

          What about the elevator?
He points to an elevator bank a couple of steps away.

          Out of order.
Bruce heads for the stairs.

          You mind giving me a hand with this
          floor?

          What? Yeah, I mind.
He continues on.



The stairwell door opens up to a LARGE ROOM with a SINGLE
DESK at the end of an otherwise empty space.
Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending
into a hole in the ceiling.

          Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah,
          looking for whoever runs this
          joint...

          Be right with y.a, just fixin' a
          light. Tell me if it's working?
CLICK and an INSANELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATES, shining
down blinding Bruce.


          Yep, seems to be.
               
          Kinda bright, though.





An electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the
ladder.

          Yeah, it is for most people. They
          spend their lives in the dark...
As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is
the SAME JANITOR.

          . . . thinkin' they can hide from me.
The two stand, angelically illuminated.    Bruce tries to put
everything together.

          Oh, the elevator's broken, huh?

          Yeah, but I'll get around to it.
The Janitor CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE and the light goes off.

          You installed a clapper?

          Nope.   Catchy jingle, though.
              


               
          You can't get it out of your head.

          I gotta go.

          Okay, but the boss'11 be right out.
The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit.
He extends his hand to Bruce.

          You must be Bruce. I've been
          expecting you.

          Oh, this is hilarious. So you're
          the boss and the electrician and
          the janitor.






          Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your
          sleeves, son. People underestimate
          the benefits of good 'ol manual
          labor. There's freedom in it.
          Happiest people in the world stink
          like hell at the end of the day.
He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk.

          Your father knew that. He was a
          damn good welder.
Bruce approaches the desk.

          How do you know my father? And how
          did you get my pager number?

          Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce.
          Pretty much everything there is to
          know. Everything you've ever said,
          done or thought about doin', is
          right there in that file cabinet.
He points out a single drawer file cabinet.

               
          Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me?
          Mind if I take a look?

          It's your life.
Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THE

The Janitor casually pulls a file.

          Now this last entry was a little
          disturbing.
He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer
dramatically sucks closed, DRAGGING BRUCE BACK. The Janitor
reads from the file.

               
          Thanks for everything, Lord.




                      JANITOR 
          I am so honored that my horrible
          demise is a part of your loving and
          mysterious plan.. The gloves are
          off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty
          smiter.
               
          I'm not much for blaspheming but
          that one made me laugh. Oh, and
          let's not forget "What kind of a
          God would let this happen? I mean,
          have you seen then news lately?"
Bruce stands, dazed. ·

          Who are you?

          I'm the creator of the heavens and
          the earth. I'm the alpha &amp; omega.
          The first and the last.

          Sorry, it's not ringing a bell.

          I'm God, Bruce.

          Oh, you're God. Well that explains
          everything1 That's how you know
          everything about me. That's how
          you got up to the seventh floor so
          quickly.
               
          Well, it's really nice to meet you.
          Thanks for the Grand Canyon and,
          ah, good luck with the apocalypse.
Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD
GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again.

          Okay, I don't know how you're doing
          that, but I really gotta go. This
          place is obviously rigged in some
          way. We're on some freaky hidden
          camera show.
               
          ...for which I will not sign a
          release, by the way! But you know
          what, I'd be a little more
          impressed if you didn't use the
          cheesy file cabinet illusion.




                        BRUCE      
              Everyone with a      brain in their head
              would know that      the drawer is being
·             fed through the       wall from behind--
    Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a
    normal back.

              Okay.     That's good.   That's a good
              one.
    Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back.

              Okay, God. How many fingers am I
              holding out?
    Bruce extends three fingers.

              Three.
    He quickly pulls one finger in.

              Two.
    Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.      God doesn't miss a
    beat.

              Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One...
    One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers.

              Okay, how about now.
    He quickly pulls in two fingers.

              Seven.


              AH HAl
    Bruce proudly presents his single hand of five extended
    fingers to God, then immediately notices he has SEVEN FINGERS



              AAAHHHl





He shakes his fingers wildly and the two extra fingers
disappear. God approaches Bruce.

          You've been doing a lot of
          complaining about me, Bruce. And
          quite frankly, I'm tired of it...
Bruce backs away from God.

          You stay away from me! I don't
          know what your doing. But whatever
          you're doing is probably
          actionable!

          Well, that's not very neighborly.
          I brought you here to offer you a
          job.

          Job? Wh at job?

          My job. You think you can do it
          better, so here's your chance.
          When you leave this building you
          will be endowed with all my powers.

          Sure, whatever you say, Pal.
He turns to go but GOD STANDS BEFORE HIM in the Janitor
uniform, holding the mop.

          All the power of God.
Bruce glances back at the empty desk, turns back again and
God the Janitor has also vanished. A beat, then Bruce
sprints out of the room.

Bruce barrels out of the building --

          Okay, that did not happen.
He races to his car stepping in the SAME PUDDLE, but this
time his foot doesn't sink, he WALKS RIGHT ACROSS IT. He
paus es f or a bea t --






          No.

He races on.



Bruce jumps in, turns the key, the car turns over but doesn't
start.

          I'm having a breakdown. That's
          what it is. Just a normal,
          everyday psychotic episode, brought
          on by tumor or brain lesion...
We hear the car wind down to nothing. Bruce releases the key
pounds the steering wheel in frustration.

              
          Come on, startI
The car INSTANTLY starts.

               
          Well, that was lucky.
Bruce backs up, peels out.




Bruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself,
immediately stops whistling.

          Okay, just relax here. I did not
          meet God and I do not have his
          powers.
               
          If that was God, then I'm Mario
          Andretti.
Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic,
dodging and passing cars right and left.






Suddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing
before Bruce waving a red flag. Bruce swerves to avoid the
man and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited
Italian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the
professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG
TIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the
driver's window.

          Hey Mario, did you get that box of
          dressing I sent you?
Bruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN --

              
          Si, dovete venire sopra per il
          pranzo un certo tempo.
              (SUBTITLES: Yes, you must
               come over for dinner some
               time.)
Bruce reacts shocked.   The crew backs off and urges him on in
Italian.

          Vete l Ve tel
Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control
the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. His car door
won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window.

He rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal
looking Tauras. Not knowing what to do, he slips into a
diner.

Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other
patron is an OLD MAN seated at the counter.

          It isn't real, it isn't real, it
          isn't real...
An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand,
stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow.

          Oh hi, ah, coffee please.
The waitress pours him a cup.






          We've got a special on soup today.


          No, that's okay.

          It's tomato.

          Alright, okay.
She heads off.    Bruce sits thinking.   Could it be real?
He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out
his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS
HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand.
Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and
sugar into his cup, looks around the table.

          Excuse me I need a spoooo...
Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his
napkin.

          That's alright, I found one.
The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves
further down the counter.
The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back.

          I lie to my sister.

          What?

               
          And I'm sleeping with my best
          friend's husband. I know he's just
          using me but.. I'm just so tired of
          being alone. I don't know why I'm
          telling you all this. Just seems
          like you'd understand.

          Okay.






               
          Take care of that whenever you're
          ready.
Bruce looks at the soup. His look grows intense.   He slowly
raises his hands over the soup bowl....


The front door blows open, as A WIND SWIRLS through the diner
and with all the flourish of Moses at the Red Sea, BRUCE

A little cockroach scurries across the table, climbs up the
edge of the bowl and walks through to the other side.

          Havin' fun?
Bruce is startled and the soup splashes back to normal
collapsing on the cockroach. He looks up at God standing
beside the booth. Bruce is now awestruck.

          You- He- Thy...

          Let's take a walk.


God leans down, lets the little soup covered cockroach go.
God and Bruce then walk along the lake shore.

               
          Most people want to kill these
          guys. I'm quite fond of em'. Very
          streamlined design. Like little
          armored tanks. Y'know, they can
          hold their breath for forty minutes
          and their cells divide only once
          per molting cycle creating a
          cytoskeleton with cell adhesion
          that...
               
          Oh, this is a bit over your head,
          isn't it?
Off Bruce's look.






          Okay, let me explain the rules.

          Rules ?

          Yeah, you left in such a rush I
          didn't get a chance to explain.

          Well the two extra fingers freaked
          me out a little bit.

               
          I figured that would get your
          attention.. I did the same thing to
          Ghandi, he couldn't eat for three
          weeks. Now, here's the deal. You
          have all my power. Use it any way
          you choose. There are only two
          rules. You can't tell anyone
          you're God. Believe me you don't
          want that kind of attention. And
          you can't mess with free will.

          Uh huh.   Can I-ask why?

              
          Yes you can. That's the beauty it.
Suddenly a LARGE SAILBOAT SAIL PASSES RIGHT BY THEM.   Bruce
looks to the sail, oddly, then...
WIDE ANGLE - REVEAL God and Bruce are now walking ON THE LAKE
about 100 feet from the shore. They watch the sailboat pass.
Bruce is awestruck.

          This is amazing.

          Oh, speaking of amazing...
God dips his hand in the Lake and pulls out THE PRAYER BEADS.
He pockets them as he talks.






           Since you're finished with these, I
           think I'll hang to 'em. Might come
           in handy someday.


God and Bruce are tiny figures on the river, as God begins to
walk away.

           I'll be seein' ya.

           Where are you going?

           I'm taking a vacation.

           God can't take a vacation. Can he?
           Can you?

           Ever hear of the Dark Ages?
           Besides, I'm covered. You can fix
           everything in five minutes if you
           want to, right?


           ...Right.
Left alone, Bruce begins to carefully tip toe back to shore,
progresses to a full sprint.


Grace and Debbie stand at the check-out stand. Grace flips
through a celeb magazine, as Debbie places the last few items
from the cart to the conveyor belt.
In the background, throughout, Debbie's daughter, Zoe is
grabbing random items off the shelves and placing them on the
belt.

                
           Gosh, this girl is so talented and
           all they ever talk about is her
           hair.






          Yeah, she should marry somebody
          famous, take the focus off.
Grace checks her cell phone screen.

          We would have heard it ring.

          I know. It's just that he usually
          calls during the day.

          He just needs to blow off some
          steam, he'll be fine.

          I hope so. I've never seen him                        *
          that mad. An d I lashed back--                        *

          Wow, you lashed? You never lash.
          I'm impressed.

          I feel bad for him.   He's wanted
          anchor for so long.
Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt.

          Well, I've been praying to win the
          lottery for fifteen years, but it's
          not going to happen. You know,
          it's not all about money.
The CLERK finishes ringing the last item.

          That'll be four hundred and twenty-
          seven, eighty.-

          What?!
Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter
items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred
or so Tic-Tac mint containers.

          Zoe.
                 




                       DEBBIE 
             Hang on, I might need you to un-
             check a few things.
The people in line hem and haw, exasperated.

             Come on, lady.

               
          Hey, everybody back-off i
Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion.

          Listen, I better get back. I want
          to be there for him.

          You're a saint, Grace.

          What can I say, I love him. And if
          I know Bruce, he's out there
          wandering around with the weight of
          the world on his shoulders.




Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence.
He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it BLASTS
WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start playing.
A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she
passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH
and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP.

          And he saw that it was good.
He spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a
cool, casu   al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens
them, HE'S   WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is
dressed in   his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better.
Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up,
hanging out in the alley.

          B-e-a-utifull






Bruce approaches the gang.

             Hey guys, remember me?
The gang members turn to Bruce.

             Oh look, it's the hero.

             Hungry for another can of whoop-
             ass?

             Your stereo sounds great in my car,
             man.
He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five.

             Look, I don't want to fight you
             guys. So as soon as you apologize,
             I'll be on my way.
A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING.         A few circle
behind, surrounding Bruce.

             Oh, yeah. I'll apologize... The
             day a monkey climbs out of my butt.

             What a coincidence. That's today.
The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a
MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants.
The Big Guy looks at Hood #1.

             Did that come out of your butt,
             man?
Hood #1 faints from shock.

             Now I'm going to have to teach the
             rest of you guys a lesson.






           Yeah, you and whose army?

           Just me... and me...
ANOTHER BRUCE steps out from behind a stack of crates.

           And me, and me, and me, me, me, me,
           me and me and me.
As Bruce talks, DUPLICATE BRUCE'S begin popping out from
various spots, a doorway, hanging down from a fire escape, a
dumpster pops open, six Bruce's jump out.




Hood #2 is instantly tackled by THREE BRUGES --
ONE BRUCE kneels down behind a hood, ANOTHER BRUCE pushes him
down over his back. The two Bruce's high-five --
A Hood climbs a fire escape. ONE BRUCE gives a hand up to
ANOTHER BRUCE, who takes pursuit. ANOTHER BRUCE leans out of
a window SMASHES a potted plant over his head --


Our Bruce stands in the middle of the action, happily
watching the mayhem.

           Let's get out of here, manl
Hood #2 takes off running, the gang members follow.

           Okay guys, Kum Ba Yal
The Bruce's jog over, leaping and diving into Bruce's body.

           I'll take it from here.
Bruce takes a deep breath, OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE, RELEASING A








The gang streams out of the alley screaming, COVERED IN

Bruce exits the alley, the monkey at his side.        He looks down
to the monkey.

           Back home for you, little one.
The monkey takes off back into the alley, as we see HOOD #1
stumbling to his feet.

           NoI   NOOOOO1
He takes off running, the monkey in hot pursuit.

He belches and one last locust flies out.      He reacts to the
unpleasant aftertaste and walks off.



We widen to an UP ANGLE of him standing on the top of
Buffalo's tallest SKYSCRAPER. Clouds swirl behind him. He
looks out over the vast city lights, opens his arms and
proclaims to the world.



Bruce poses in dramatic god-like form, lightning crashes
behind him. He is an awesome god.


Grace sits on the floor next to the coffee table with a box
of photos working on the album. She takes a sip of wine,
sets down the glass. Sam walks over and laps up the wine.

                
           Well, at least I have someone to
           drink with.
Grace hears Bruce coming up the stairs, singing.






          What if God was one of us. . .
          Just a slob like one of us...
          Just a stranger on a bus...
          Trying to make his way. . .
Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets
up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile,
holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS.

              
          ...home.

              
          Oh, my God.

          You can call me Bruce.

          Where have you been? You're
          so...happy.

          Who wouldn't be on a night like
          this?
               
          For you.
Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up
his mood.

          These are amazing. What are they?

          It's a totally new breed. A cross
          pollination between tulips and
          Daisies. I call them Todayzees.

          Todayzees? Okay...
Grace goes to put them in water.


          Bruce, is there something you're
          not telling me?





          Nothing of this world. Why?

          What do you mean, why? Last night
          you weren't exactly happy with
          life.

          Last night, I was only human.
Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively.

Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he
passes.

          CD 4, Track 7.
The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays.

Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. He surveys
the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ERASES THE

Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon
and makes a LASSOING MOTION, THEN BEGINS TO PULL.


Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE
the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH.

Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with
points of his finger.
Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the
perfectly orchestrated sky.

          Wow, it really cleared up. I've
          never seen the moon that big.
Bruce puts his arms around Grace from behind.






          We shouldn't waste it.
Bruce starts kissing her neck. Grace turns, .they kiss and a
METEOR SHOWER lights the sky behind them. The kiss ends.

          Bedroom.

          Five minutes.


Grace grabs a neglige from the drawer, heads into the
bathroom. Bruce enters, adjusts the ambience of the room,
BLOWS THE LIGHTS OUT with a quick puff of air, LIGHTS CANDLES
with a gesture. His clothes magically fall away.


Grace slips her neglige on, begins brushing her hair.

          I'11 be out in a minute.

          Don't rush yourself. Sometimes                        *
          anticipation can heighten the                         *
          pleasure.                                             *
Grace SHUDDERS a bit at the word "pleasure", quickly finishes *
brushing, picks up her lipstick.                             *

          It's a funny thing about, pleasure.                   *
GRACE'S KNEES BUCKLE, causing the lipstick to smear across *
her face. She sits down on the toilet seat to get a hold of *
herself.                                                    *

          It can be extremely pleasurable.                      *
Grace has a very POWERFUL ORGASM and slides off the toilet *
out of frame to the ground.                                *

                                                *
          Oh, oh. Oh my...                                      *







Standing at the door with both arms extended toward the
bathroom like an WARLOCK CASTING A SPELL. Suddenly the light
hits him from the open bathroom door and he quickly strikes a
casual pose.
Grace stands in the open doorway, panting like an animal.
She dives on Bruce, attacking him.



          In international news, Japanese
          relief workers are staging a
          desperate effort to rescue hundreds
          of people stranded by a freak tidal
          wave that hit Kitamoto City...
We see remote footage of Japanese families being airlifted
from root tops.

          Scientists say the tsunami may have
          been caused by what they're
          describing as "unusual lunar
          activity." More on this, as it
          develops. . .
Grace half watches the newscast as she finishes breakfast.

Bruce lies blissfully asleep. Big smile, life is good.
Then, we hear WHISPERING - Like distant voices MURMURING all
at once. Bruce wakes with a start. He looks around puzzled,
sticks his finger in his ear checking his hearing as the
voices fade away.

Circling, getting ready to go on the carpet. Bruce casually
warns.

          Sam. Uh uh uh.





Sam looks at Bruce for a beat, then  walks into bathroom,
raises the toilet seat with his nos e, and STANDS UP ON HIS

WE DON'T SEE IT) AND STARTS TO GO.   He looks proudly back at
Bruce.


          Good boy.



Grace places breakfast on the table. Bruce comes out, fully
dressed with a spring in his step.

          Good morning.

               
          Good morning. Cooked you grilled
          cheese.

          Oo, my favey.
Bruce sits, Grace sets down his plate, leans close.

          Last night was just...

          Heavenly?

          Mmm hmm.
Bruce enjoys his grilled cheese.

          It's funny, but when I woke up this
          morning, It felt like my boobs were
          bigger.
Bruce looks away, guilty, trying to be nonchalant.

               
          Do they look bigger to you?

          Huh? Ah, no, they, ah, look the
          same to me.




They aren't.    They are clearly bigger.      She holds them.

            They're definitely bigger.      They
            feel huge to me.
Bruce throws up his hands.

            You got me. Probably just a
            hormonal thing.
                 
            Well, enjoy your breakfast, I've
            gotta run.

            Where are you going?
He stops, turns. A new confident Bruce.

            To get my job back.


Bruce heads for his severely beat-up junker car whistling
"What if God were One of Us."



He gets in, fastens his seat belt, as two teenagers cruise by
on skateboards, stop outside Bruce's window.

                 
            Wow, nice car man.

            Well, it gets me from A to B.

Reveal Bruce's car is now a brand new MERCEDES 2003 VISION
SLR. He starts and revs THE POWERFUL NEW ENGINE and peels
out.






Bruce turns the corner into bumper to bumper traffic. No
problem, the traffic magically opens up for him, cars
instantly swerving right and left clearing a path for Bruce.
He waves as he passes.

          And the last shall be first.


A POLICE DOG, HANK, performs some standard TAKE DOWNS by
"attacking" a "criminal"  on the run. PHIL, a
reporter from a rival station is wrapping up his story.

          I certainly wouldn't want to be a
          fugitive on the run with Hank,
          Buffalo's number one police dog, on
          the job. This is Phil Sidleman
          reporting from The Police Canine
          Training center.
              
          And cut it. Let's go, guys.
The crew start to wrap up.

Watching the action from the side, holding his own home video
camera. Phil spots him.

          Hey, channel seven, right? You're
          the guy that went crazy.

          Yeah, I had a bad day. But things
          are lookin' up.

          What are you doin' here?

          Just lookin' for a story.

              
          Well, this pond's fished out.
          Pretty standard stuff anyway.





          I don't know. My instinct tells me
          there's something more.

          Well, go with that. It's served
          you well in the past, right?
Phil and a couple of his crew laugh, as they load the last of
their equipment into the van and shut the doors.


          Hey, Hank found something1

Phil turns back, Bruce and he exchange a glance.

Hank is DIGGING FURIOUSLY, making a BIG HOLE. The Policeman
jogs over, joins the trainer. They watch as TWO DRESS SHOES
ARE UNCOVERE D IN THE DI RT. Hank BARKS.


          We got a bodyI


              
          Shit. Get the camera, now!



It LOCKS AUTOMATICALLY.   The CAMERAMAN yanks at the door.


           It's locked and the keys are
           inside I
Bruce casually turns his camera on, gives Phil a "tough
break" look, heads for the scene, as Phil and his crew
scramble around the van.




          The body of Jimmy Hoffa was
          uncovered in a field today outside
          of a canine training center in
          Buffalo New York. Local Buffalo
          freelance field reporter Bruce
          Nolan was the first on the scene...




We cut to the pre-taped story. Bruce stands with Hank and
his trainer before camera, the body being exhumed from the
ground behind him.

          Since the disapearence of Teamster
          president Jimmy Hoffa in the
          nineteen sixties, his whereabouts
          have remained one of this country's
          great unsolved mysteries. That is
          until just moments ago, when during
          a routine training session, a
          police dog named Hank sniffed his
          way right into the history books.
          As you can see behind us, the body
          is being carefully exhumed and will
          be transported to a hospital
          facility where DNA testing will
          confirm the identity. That, of
          course, only a formality as in a
          bizarre twist, the body was found
          buried with a birth certificate and
          complete set of dental records.
               
          Sort of a two-in-one for Hank
          today, as moments later, he busted
          a local news camera crew with four
          kilo's of marijuana.
We see footage of PHIL AND HIS NEWS CREW, being cuffed on the
ground, as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled
from the van.

          I've never seen it before, I swear I

As Bruce pulls up in front of the building the NO PARKING
SIGN flies back into the bushes and the RED CURB TRANSFORMS
TO GREEN as though being sloppily painted with invisible
brushes.
Bruce exits the car and smooths past the Homeless Sign Guy,
who sits in his usual spot. His sign reads:



Bruce cruises through the office, fielding greetings.






          Nice Job, Bruce...Way to go,
          buddy...GO get 'em, Bruce, etc.
Susan Ortega smooths up to Bruce.

          Hi, Bruce.


               
          Oh, Susan.. Hi.

          Good work, I'm impressed.
She give's Bruce a "look" and continues on. Bruce is a bit
inflated by the encounter.
Bobby the pastry cart guy wheels his cart up along side.

          Hey, Br uce . N ice job , m an. Wa sn' t
          the same without you around here,
          pal.
               
          I hear Jack wants to see you.

          That's the word.

          You're going to need your energy in
          there. Can I interest you in a
          donut?

          No, thank you, I'm not hungry.

          Coffee?

          No.

          Fiber grain bar with bee pollen and
          Spiralina?

          I'm really not interested.






          Yeah, I don't blame 'ya, they taste
          like grass.
Bobby CUTS BRUCE OFF WITH HIS CART.    Bruce is forced to stop.


          Tell you    what? I wasn't going to

          I made a    batch of rhubarb that you
          have got    to try.

          Bobby, I--

          Come on, it's my mother's recipe
          she's practically cripple...
Bobby forces a ladle of rhubarb out at Bruce.

          No, I really- no...

          Open up, that's it, here comes the
          news chopper...
               

          No, Bobby.. Bobby N01 I said I
          didn't want anything.
               
          Damn you...
Bruce continues    off, as Bobby stops cold, adopts an odd
expression, then    his EYES ROLL UP IN THEIR SOCKETS, SPIN ALL

FROM HIS SKULL.     He turns instantly demonic.

An overly PERKY FEMALE OFFICE WORKER approaches Bobby from
behind.

          Hi, Bobby. Is there any of that
          split pea soup left?
She is instantly hit in the chest with a stream of green
vomit. A beat and Bobby offers out a plastic spoon.







He sees Bruce enter, immediately perks up.                         *

          Look, I'll be straight. We want
          you back, Bruce. I want to tell
          you, it wasn't my decision to let
          you go. When the big guy gives the
          order, I gotta...

          No harm no foul, Jack. I needed
          some time off to reassess my goals
          and get in touch with my true self.

          You did that in a day?

          Imagine what I can do with seven.
Jack pauses for an awkward beat.       His face grows serious.

          I haven't been the best father in
          the world.

          What's that?

Jack recovers, rejuvenated.






          Yeah, I gotcha. It feels good to
          get that out. Thank you.
Jack gives Bruce a big hug.

          Look,    it's not in my power to give
          you a   nchor, but as far as field
          repor   ting goes, if you're looking
          for a    bump.

          Jack, don't worry about that. Just
          give me a camera and a crew and
          I'll give you the news.
Bruce exits.    Jack likes the new Bruce.

Bruce heads out as The Eyewitness News opening plays on
several monitors. Susan Ortega opens.

          Good evening and welcome to
          Eyewitness News at six. I'm Susan
          Ortega.

          And I'm Evan Baxter. And here's
          what's making news...
This stops Bruc e. He watc hes Evan on a newsr oom monit or. A
devilish smile forms on Bruce's face.

          A potential scandal with the
          Buffalo P.D. surfaced today when...
Evan's voice suddenly becomes HIGH PITCHED, like a girls.

                
           ...the mayor demanded that the
           Chief of Police issue...

                              I'm sorry. There seems to be
                              something.
                   Evan shoots Susan a look to cover for him.        Susan tries to
                   cover with a joke.

                               Looks like my new co-anchor may

                   Evan stops cold, staring at the teleprompter.

                   The Director in the booth reacts.

                               What did he just say? Check the
                               prompter.
                   The Console Operator checks the text being fed to Evan.

                               It's fine.

                               Well, signal for him to keep going.

Susan reaches for a water pitcher, as a crew man steps in and
BLASTS Evan's head with a fire extinguisher. Evan is in
shock, his face now white.
The screen cuts to a "PLEASE STAND-BY" title card, then cuts
to an episode of "Dragnet."
ON BRUCE - It's fun to be God.




Bruce is bored off his ass, interviewing some BLUE HAIRED OLD
LADIES at the Mark Twain chili cook off.

              (talks so slow you want to
               kill yourself)
          My secret is I let the jalapeno's
          marinade in a spicy sauce for over
          24 hours before I--
We see Bruce's pained face, realizing what horrible news this
is, when he gets an idea and SCHWWWWWAAAAAAM!11 AN ASTEROID
CRASHES to earth behind them.

          Hold that thought, Hazel!
               (Bruce walks back toward
                the explosion)
          It seems some type of meteor or
          asteroid has, by chance, hit the
          earth right behind the Mark Twain
          Chili Cook Off. . .



Bruce is free-falling in full sky diving uniform.

           . . . So remember, it's sky diving
           season at Old Pete's airfield.
                
           This is Bruce Nolan..
                (gives it a tug, doesn't
                 budge)
           My rip cord appears to be a bit
           stuck.
Bruce yanks again harder, nothing, then again and the cord
rips free from the suit.






              This is a very unfortunate turn of
              events. I'm heading toward the
              earth at a very precarious speed...
The cameraman pops his shoot and we see Bruce continue to
stream toward the ground below. He falls into a wooded area.
A CAMERA ON THE GROUND picks up the coverage, runs through
the brush with other BYSTANDERS to find Bruce laying on top
of a BIG, HAIRY CREATURE.

              He's okay...What's that?...It's
              Bigfoot!...Bigfoot broke his
              fall!. . .
Bruce stands groggy, points to a dazed Bigfoot.

              Ah ha!     You are real!


Bruce sits watching a hockey game on TV. He follows the puck
intently with his eyes, as though controlling it's path.






Grace sits aside him, working on the photo album.

              Do you believe how they're playing?
                  
              Oh, honey, would you hand me the
              scissors?
Bruce diverts his attention, when the Sabers screw up and the
crowd GROANS. Bruce immediately turns, looks intently at the
puck and GOAL, SABERS! THE CROWD ROARS!




Grace's BOOBS ARE EVEN BIGGER. Bruce is trying to help her
fasten her bra, but it's a good three inches from touching.
Bruce shrugs "got me."





Bruce is doing a report just outside the Pandas' enclosure.

           In the past, zoo officials have
           been unable to get these Panda's to
           mate, but that doesn't seem to be a
           problem today.
REVEAL A MALE PANDA wholeheartedly humping another PANDA.

Bruce finishes running a bath, gets into the tub but SLIPS as
is UNABLE TO SINK and ends up sliding around ON THE WATER
like on a sheet of glass. He tries to break through, can't.
Then, he concentrates and finally LOWERS INTO THE WATER.

Bruce surrounded by Hazel and other chili cook off
contestants shouts up from the bottom of the crater hole:

Grace lies in full body wrap, while Debbie is in the process
of being wrapped by MARGARITA, a rather ruff Spanish Salon
attendant.

          So this is what success buys you.

          I guess.
              
          I feel like a human taquito.

          Well, thank Mr. Exclusive for me.
          He's on a quite a roll. What'd he
          do make a deal with the devil?

          And he's taking me out tonight to
          dinner at Chez L'Amour.

          Well, la-ti-da. Mike's idea of a
          romantic evening is Chez Sizzler.
Margarita pulls the wrap tightly around Debbie.

               
          What does this do again?

          EstS para su grasa.

          Grasa? Doesn't that mean fat?






          Afraid so.
Debbie eyes Margarita.

              
          So, Bruce said and I quote:
          "Prepare yourself for an amazing
          evening that will change our lives
          forever."
Margarita reaches Debbie's waist and YANKS tightly.

          Good - you wouldn't want to leave
          any spare oxygen in there.
               
          Wait a second, you don't think he's
          going to propose, do you?

          I don't think anything.

          You do. You think he's going to
          propose.

          Well, he's always said when he gets
          his career together, you know...
          And his career is more than
          together. I mean, come on, Chez
          L'Amour. Change our lives...

          I don't know, hun. I mean, I like
          Bruce but that man's priority list
          is him, him, him, then him some
          more and then you.

          Well, he just might surprise you.

          That's what I'm worried about.
               
          Careful, you missed a spot of free
          flowing circulation.
Margarita senses the attitude and pulls tighter. Debbie
reacts.





          That'd do it.
Margarita motions for Debbie to lay down and leaves.    Debbie
struggles to lay down.

          Let's see, how do I--
Debbie slides to the ground, Grace cracks up, gets up to
help, but also in mummy wrap, topples on top of her. They
both laugh and struggling to get up.
Hearing the ruckus, Margarita enters and gasps.

          Lesbianas1
Grace and Debbie crack up harder.

          Hey, I'll take that over fat...
Margarita tries to pull them up, but falls too.

          No sexo, no sexol
Grace and Debbie can't stop laughing.

A waiter pours the first trickle of wine into Bruce's glass.
Bruce whiffs it, tastes it.

          Very good. If you run out just
          bring me some water, I'll take it
          from there.
Grace looks over the menu as Bruce notices people at various
tables eyeing him. He glances up to a ceiling light and
REDIRECTS IT with his mind, so it SPOTLIGHTS HIM in golden
light.
TWO CUTE GIRLS with dates SMILE and wave.     He waves back.

          Should we ask for a more private
          table?






          Huh? Oh, no this is fine right
          here.
Bruce looks at Grace lovingly.      He takes her hand.

          I was going to wait until after the
          meal, but I think it's going to
          just bust out of me if I don't do
          it now.
Grace beams, looks at Bruce with total love.

          You ready?

              
          I think so.

          I got anchor.
Grace's face falls.    She does her best to cover.

          Evidently, they're having problems
          with Evan. He's finishing up the
          week and I go live Monday.

          That's great, honey.
          Congratulations. Wow. So that's
          what's tonight is about?

          Well, yeah. Grace, I got anchor.

She's having a hard time covering her let down.

               (noticing her flat
                reaction)
          What's the matter?

          Well, to be honest, I thought that
          maybe tonight, you--
The TWO CUTE GIRLS interrupt, approach Bruce.






                       I'm sorry, but we had to come over.
                       We just think you're amazing and...

                       Well, we can't believe it's you!
             They both laugh, Bruce enjoys the attention.

                            
                       Yep, it's me.

                       Can we get a picture with you?

                       Well, sure.
                            
                       Just one second, hun.
                            
                       Fans. We better get used to this,
                       huh?
             Grace sits watching the two girls take turns sitting on
             Bruce's lap, taking pictures. Sees Bruce relishing in the
             attention. One girl gives Bruce a peck on the cheek and they
r"sS!w^w!s
             leave. Grace is clearly upset.

                       You have lipstick on your face.

                       Oh, thanks...

                       Bruce, we need to talk. I thought
                       we had an understanding--
             Suddenly, the WHISPERS start again. Bruce looks around,
             figures it's coming from the restaurant patrons.

                       Wow. It's kind of loud in here.
             Grace looks around the quiet romantic setting.

                       What are you talking about? It's
                       not loud.
             The WHISPERS GROW IN VOLUME.






          Geez...
               
-----   - COULD YOU ~KEEP TT DOWNl---  --

          Bruce, this isn't funny.

               (talking loud .over the
                "racket")


He gets up and darts off.

Bruce races through the restaurant kitchen holding his ears -

He BURSTS out the kitchen exit into the alley. Unclasps his
ears, but no relief. The whispers are now loud voices. We
start to make out fragments of words "Please," "Help me,"
etc.
Overwhelmed and scared, he slides down the alley wall,
covering his face, then TOTAL SILENCE --
Bruce lowers his hands and finds himself SITTING ATOP A HIGH


          Really something isn't it?
God sits down next to Bruce.

          Is this heaven?
God laughs at this one.

          It's Everest. You should try
          flipping on the Discovery Channel
          every now and then. Well, I guess
          you can't now, being dead and all.

          I'm dead?I
God laughs.






          No, I'm just messing with you.

          Those voices...

          They're prayers, Bruce. You keep
          ignoring them and they're going to
          build up on. you like that. You
          didn't think being God was going to
          be all fun and games did you?

          Prayers? Those are prayers? Why
          can't I understand them?
God forms a snowball in his hands as he talks.

          You aren't listening, son. Let's
          see, you've had my powers for over
          a week now and how many people have
          you helped?

          Okay, so maybe I've righted a
          couple of the wrongs in my own
          life. I was going to get around to
          others. I can do both. I can help
          the world.

          The world? That wasn't the world,
          Bruce. That was just Buffalo,
          between Commonwealth and 57th.
          Didn't want to start you out with
          more than you can handle. Now how
          you doing otherwise? Personal life
          in good shape?

          Yeah. Everything is great.
A DOORWAY OPENS like a crack in space. Grace steps out, sees
Bruce.

          Bruce? What are you doing out
          here?
With that, the terrain TRANSFORMS back into the alley where
Grace has been standing all along. She can not see .God.






          Oh, ah,
               
          She can't...
               (God shakes his head, back
                to Grace)
          I just, ah, needed a little fresh
          air.
Bruce fakes a couple big breaths.

          Bruce, what is going on? The
          second I want to talk about us you
          run out on me.

               
          Everything's great, huh?

          I wasn't running out on you...

          You know, I actually had the crazy
          idea that you were going to ask me
          to marry you tonight.

          Now it's heating up.

               
          You are not helping.
              
          ...me at all here, Grace.

               
          Nice recovery.
Bruce looks to God to shut up.

          Not helping you what?

              
          Look hun, I want to talk about
          this. This just isn't a good time.
          Okay?





          When is it a good time? It's never
          a good time.

              She's got a point.

                  
              Stay out of this.
Grace looks at him like he's nuts.



          Who are you talking to?!
Just then, the WHISPERS start in again.        Bruce reacts.

              Oh, not now.
Bruce puts his hands to his ears.       Grace takes this as him
not wanting to listen to her.

          You're going to have to answer
          those things, y'know.

Grace heads back into the restaurant. Bruce stands
completely frustrated.

              
          Thank you.

          You want some friendly advice?

          No.
God smiles.

     Bruce sits before a High Tech computer sitting on a    desktop.   *
     We HEAR the famous "You've Got Mail" sound bite.                  *





          Welcome to the information super
          highway. No mess, full bless.
A COMPUTER PROGRESS BAR titled "Downloading Prayers" appears
on screen, there's a long, long way to go.
Bruce watches and waits, bored - looks at his watch.               *



He's fallen asleep by the computer. As he wakes he sees:           *
"1,567,432 unread messages"                                        *

          Whoa.                                                    *
Suddenly, Grace bounds out of the bathroom.                        *

          Okay, this is getting ridiculous I
Grace's boobs are enormous! A healthy D-cup.

          I have to see a doctor. There's
          definitely something wrong with me.

Bruce jumps up from the computer, hides what he's doing...

          No.     You look great.

          I look like a hooker I My whole
          body is changing.
She turns profile, her back sways causing her ass to stick
out.

          My back didn't used to arch like
          this.
Bruce gets up, walks to Grace.

          I think you look amazing.                                *





          Bruce, I feel like our relationship
          is becoming all about sex.

          No it's not. Come on, give me a

          hug.

          No, Bruce. Come on.                                   *
She breaks away and sees the computer is on.                    *

           What's that? What are you doing?                     *
Bruce tries to cover.                                           *

          Oh, ah. Nothing. Surfing the                          *

          late.

          No, I'm not.
Bruce looks over Grace's shoulder and ADJUSTS THE CLOCK FORTY
MINUTES FORWARD. Grace turns and is surprised.

          Oh my goshI How did I sleep this
          late? I've got to run. Are you
          giving me a ride?

          Don't need to.
Bruce motions to the window. Grace walks over, looks out and

Bruce turns away from the window, gets back to the computer.

          the Red Wings beat the Sabers.
Bruce puzzles over the two prayers.           Starts typing.

          Yes to you, loyal Sabers fan. And
          no to you.

Bruce smiles, this is fun.

Bruce sits at the computer, looks at the total prayer
requests, his jaw drops. 3 MILLION and growing.

          Oh, come on. What a bunch of
          whiners. This is going to suck up

          attached to it.

Bruce pulls up, Grace, her BODY BACK TO NORMAL, walks up and
hops in, happy.

          L ook! I'm back to no rmal. It was
          the wildest thing, I was worried,
          so I said a prayer and the next
          thing I know, I was completely
          healed. It was like a miracle.

              
          That's great.

          So, you're taking me to lunch?
          Th is i s ra re --
               
          But wonderful.

          Oh, I've got something better than
          lunch.
Bruce pulls out. They drive off.

          Oh, you'll never believe it.
          Debbie won the lotteryI

          Really?






           But get this, there were like 433
           thousand other winners, so it only
           paid out 17 dollars. Can you
           believe the odds of that?


Bruce leads her out of the car.

           Keep 'em closed...

               
          What is this?


Bruce leads Grace through the gates.                              *

          Okay...open your eyes.
Grace does and sees A STAGGERING MANSION.                         *

          Wow. This is a bit overwhelming.                        *

          I know, it's incredible. Come on                        *
          in, look.                                               *


As amazing as it is, it's interior design is way over the top *
ritzy. Painted ceilings, gold trim everwhere.          '      *

                                                        *
          This place is hilarious.     Are you                    *
          doing a story here?                                     *

                                                             *
          No. Guess again?                                        *
Grace turns to Bruce confused.

          It's mine...ours.






          What?

              
          This is our new home.    Come on...
Bruce pulls Grace up the stairs.

          This had to cost-- I can't even
          imagine how much this had to cost.

          7 million. That was the asking,
          but I got a deal.

          Wh-What am I missing here? You
          can't afford this. You're a
          reporter. Buying cars is one
          t hing, but this--
Bruce grabs a hold of Grace.

          We'll have the money. Listen to me
          closely. I'm getting anchor.
          Then, I'm going to get spotted,
          offers will come flooding in to go
          national, and then you and I are
          moving to New York City to a place
          that will put this to shame. This
          has been my exact dream my whole
          life and it's finally going to
          happen. Every step just how I
          pictured it.

Grace just stares at Bruce.

          There's only one problem.

          What?

          I hate it.
Bruce is surprised.






What were you thinking? Why didn't              *
you talk to me about this?                      *

I wanted to surprise you.                       *

Mission accomplished.                           *

Honestly, I thought you'd be a
little more appreciative.

Appreciative of what? The fact
that you didn't include me on a
major life decision or that we now
live in the Sultan of Bernai's                  *
house?                                          *

     
Like pearls to swine.

What is that supposed to mean?

Let those with ears hear.

What is happening to you? You're
changing.


Exa ct ly. F or th e bet te r. I' m not
poor and s truggling . And mayb e
that threatens you. I'm telling
you, there are plenty of women who
would love this place.

Yeah, and so would their pimps.                 *

I can't believe this. I did all                 *
this for us.                                    *

           I want that.

           'That'. You can't even say the                       *
          word.                                                 *

          Marriage, I want marriage, okay.                      *
          It's just not a great time right
          now.

          Not a great time. What is that,
          your mantra? This is never going
          to change. . .
Grace heads down the stairs.                                    *

          Come on Grace, lighten up.                            .*
          Tomorrow's Saturday. The office is                    *
          throwing me a party here, for
          getting anchor. Let's enjoy the
          ride for a whi le. We're just
          starting to have some fun.

           No, you're just starting to have
           fun.
Suddenly, the TOILET FLUSHES off camera. Grace sees Sam in
the bathroom spraying some deodorizer before he exits.

           And what in God's name is going on
           with that dogI?
Grace pulls her cell phone .out of her purse, heads for the
door.

          I'm going to have Debbie pick me
          up.

          Grace.

          I'm sorry, but    I won't be attending
          your little pa   rty tomorrow. And if                 *
          you would like    to see me after I
          will be at our   home.                                *




She starts out.

           Oh, and that poor, struggling guy
           you talked about? I miss him.




The PARTY OF PARTIES is in order. The place is jam packed
with co-workers, fellow reporters, and various news contacts
Everyone is in an ecstatic mood, many prayers having been
recently answered. We MOVE THROUGH THE PARTY and hear
snippets of various conversations.

           I'll drink to that! My tech stocks
           tripled in five days.
They clink glasses.

           You seem taller.

           I am!

           My son pitched a no hitter!

           I lost 47 Ibs on the Krispy Kreme
           diet.

Walking on his hind legs, delivers a cold beer to Bruce.

Well on his way to plastered, takes a swig, then glances at
the beer.

                
           Hello...
               
           Corona. Lime next time?





Sam walks away, his tail between his legs.
Bruce maneuvers down the hall dancing, high-fiving, drunkenly *
accepting the praise coming at him from all sides.              *

          There he is. . . The manI.. All
          hail our new anchor!I

          Bless you. Bless you.

          Hey Bruce, who do you like in the
          game tonight?

          Put your money on the Sabers.
          Coach prays a lot.
A FRENCH WAITER approaches Bruce.


          Ah, Mr. Nolan, we're running out of
          hors doerves. I'm afraid we under-
          ordered, sir. And the people are
          hungry.

          What do you have left?
The Waiter holds up a small basket.

          Only three chips and two shrimp.

               
          Just take it around.
The Waiter gets a confused look.




The Waiter walks along amazed as handfuls of shrimp and chips
are pulled from the small basket.
Partiers crowd around Bruce, start to chant.






          Speech!   Speech!!   Speech!

Bruce takes center stage, quiets the crowd.

          I ' d thank you all for coming, but
          the liquor is free so maybe you
          should THANK ME!
Everyone laughs.


          And now let me tell you a story.
          There was a man who had two sons.
          The younger son took his
          inheritance and squandered his
          money on a life of lust and
          debauchery. I LOVE THAT GUY!!

Everyone throws their hands up and continues to party.

Bruce's big smile fades. He looks around the room, hoping to
spot Grace. He grabs a phone, walks out to the balcony,
di al s --

He gets their answering machine, hears their outgoing message
together from happier times. He hangs up.


          Hey there.

Bruce turns, sees SUSAN ORTEGA, completely stunning in a sexy
dress.

          Hi Br uce. What are you d oing out
          here all alone?

          Oh, ah, I was calling Grace.


          Yeah, I didn't see her in there. I
          love the new place, by the way. So
          how are you and Grace doing?

          I don't know, we had a fight
          earlier. Ever since I . . Well,
          things are different now and...






          You're on fire Bruce. Some women
          can't handle fire. Some can.
Susan smooths close to Bruce.

          You know, I always had an instinct
          about you. I knew you were going
          to make something of yourself.

          Really?

          There's something special about you
          Bruce. I like special...

          Look Susan, I don't know, I--
Susan grabs Bruce, kisses him passionately. Bruce doesn't
join in, but doesn't fight it either.


Grace and Debbie enter.


          So this is your new place, huh?

          Cozy, don't you think? Come on
          help me find him.
They head into the room.

          You sure you want to do this?

          I don't know. It's his big night.                      *
          I don't want to spoil it. I know                  .    *
          how much this means to him.                            *


          So much for lashing back...
Grace stops dead in her tracks. Her face drops.
GRACE'S POV - BRUCE, still lip-locked with Susan Ortega.






          Oh, boy.

Bruce turns and sees Grace.

          Grace, I...

             . 
          Get the car, Deb.

          Right.


          Grace, wait.
Grace follows Debbie out.

Bruce follows Grace outside.

          Grace, come on.
Grace stops, opens her purse, tosses the keys to her new car
in Bruce's chest.

          Here. I do n't w ant your car. I
          don't want your things. . . I don't
          want you.

          Come on, don't say that. I was
          just calling y ou--

          And you thought Susan's mouth was
          the phone?

         I didn't think you were coming-- I
         mean, I . . . I screwed up, okay.
         Let me make it up to you.

          How about a boat, Bruce?


          If that's what you want.






          Yeah, a big boat and oh, maybe two
          bags of cash, you know, the ones
          with the big cartoon dollar signs
          on the front. Then I'll be happy.
          Because I'm just hollow inside.
          Debbie's been right. All this
          time. I defended you, told her
          there was good in you. Another
          side to you. Well, I just saw that
          other side and I don't want
          anything to do with it.
Debbie pulls up, Grace storms off to the car. Bruce follows,

          Grace, come on, don't do this.

          Go back to your little co-anchor.
          Or is that ho-anchor?
               
          I came back here to apologize. How
          stupid am I?
Grace turns and heads to the car.

          You're the one that didn't like the
          new place!
Grace gets in, slams the door.

          You can't walk out on me! I'm the
          alpha, lady! I'm the Omega!
Debbie peels out.

               
          I could make you stay!
Bruce is left alone in the middle of the street.

          Fine! I don't need you! I have
          everything I need. Did you hear
          that?!
               
          I have EVERYTHING!





Bruce walks in, Susan is waiting for him.

           I was right. She couldn't handle
           the fire.

Bruce looks at Susan with disgust, then glances to a FIRE
ALARM on the wall, mentally TRIGGERS IT. The sprinklers turn
on, as well. People scream, rush toward the exit.
Bruce sits down on the sofa, being rained on by the
sprinklers, alone. He finally plops back and God is sitting
next to him.

          Enjoying your party? Yeah, nothing
          like spending time with some real
          frien ds. Any s hrimp left ?

           Grace left me.

           I know.

               
          She'll take me back.
               
          Will she take me back?

          Would you take you back?
Bruce mulls this over,- then...

          How do you make someone love you
          when you can't effect free will?

          Welcome to my world, son. You come
          up with an answer to that one, you
          let me know.
Off of Bruce thinking...







Grace's alarm goes off. The radio comes on and it plays a
John Cougar Mellencamp song. But the lyrics are different.

           Here's a little ditty,
           about Grace and her man Bruce,
           two Americans growing up,
           needing to make a truce.
Grace's eyes pop open.    Is she dreaming?

Bruce hides behind a hedge, watches Grace jog past.

notices something    CARVED IN THE TREE it reads: "GRACE +
BRUCE". Carved in     the next tree, "A COUPLE FOR THE AGES".
Carved in the next    tree, "COME ON ALREADY, GIVE HIM ANOTHER
CHANCE". She does     a double take, continues on.


Grace reaches in her purse to pay for her coffee and a bunch
of PICTURES FALL OUT. They are all of Bruce and Grace. She
thinks, definitely didn't -put them there.


Grace is helping one of the kids, when she notices something
outside the window. It's a cloud formation that strangely
looks like BRUCE  HOLDING HANDS WITH GRACE. She
reacts as the imagery melts away into a very faint "FORGIVE



Grace is talking with one of the other teachers. The kids,
playing dodgeball in the background, laugh and scream louder
and louder. Grace turns and sees...
Bruce getting pelted by multiple balls.

           Okay, surrender, surrender.
He walks over to Grace.

           Hi.






          Hi..

          I, ah, have my first anchor
          tonight.

          That's great. I hope it goes well
          for you.
He's hit in the head by a ball.    Grace can't help but smiles
Bruce leaps at the opportunity.

          I miss you.
              
          I just took the first step, shot
          myself out on the ledge, awaiting
          vulnerably your response.

          . . . I don't know what to say.

          How about you love me and you'll
          take me back.

          No, Bruce.

          Come on, what about all the signs?

          What? How do you know about that?
          Did you talk to Debbie?

               
          Would it help if I told you I acted
          like an ass?
Martin is standing nearby.

          Hey, you said ass.

          It's okay as long as you mean a
          donkey. I didn't add "hole." It's
          only bad when you say "ass-ho--





           Alright, inside, Martin.
                
           Okay everyone, inside.
The kids race in. Grace starts to follow.

           Grace, please. None of this seems                    *
           right without you.                                   *
                                              *
           Is that a glimmer of hope I see?                     *

           I have to go...                                      *
She starts off. . .

           Wait.
Bruce DRAMATICALLY RAISES A HAND TOWARD GRACE, like putting a
love spell on her.

           Now how do you feel?
She looks at him, oddly.

           ...Are you out of your mind? Have
           you been drinking?

           Drin kin g? Sur e. I'm dru nk wit h

Bruce RAISES BOTH HANDS IN FULL HEXING FASHION...



                
           You need help.
She heads back inside. Bruce throws his hands in the air,
frustrated.

Bruce heads for his car as he sees a two guys in PRISON SUITS
 drive off with it.





          Hey11   That's my car!!

The PRISONERS drive off laughing.

          Ha, nice wheels, huh?
BRUCE sits up in the back seat.

          Thou shalt not steal.
The prisoners JUMP.

          Car, show them the way out.
Instantly, the car doors fly open and the seats tilt sideways
dumping the prisoners.

          What is wrong with the world?



          The Dow skyrocketed again today and
          with a new influx of paper
          millionaires, analysts are warning
          of a potential run on banks...
We see a stock graph superimposed on the screen with a
ludicrous jump straight up off the charts.


          The scene nearly turned violent
          when hundreds of disgruntled
          Buffalo residents protested the
          results of lasts weeks fluke
          lottery results...







          ...another 37 arrests today at the
          Beasley Construction Site for
          indecent exposure. . .
We see women getting pulled away one by one into police vans,
after they flash their tops. In the background, a "Girl's
Gone Wild" van is there rolling tape of each flashing.


          The world's gone mad.
Jack clicks off the monitor. Bruce hustles in from make-up.
An air of forced confidence about him. Nothing and no one is
going to ruin his big moment.

          Oh, there you are. Your big debut.
          How you feeling?

          You know what? I'm good. The show
          must go on.
Bruce sits in the anchor desk, breathes in the reality.

               
          Bruce, if I had any idea Grace was
          going to be there last night...

          Susan, you didn't do anything                          *
          wrong. In fact, I found the                            *
          moment rather pleasurable.                             *
Susan shudders, tries to compose himself.

               
          Oh, really. . . that's nice.

          Okay, the Sabers just won the
          Stanley Cup. It's getting pretty
          crazy out there. We're going to
          kick live to Fred at the stadium.
          Oh, and Bruce, you won the pool
          again. Exact score, dead on.
          Twenty-three to one, who would have
          thought.

              This is it, you good?
    Bruce nods, straightens in his chair, prepares for his dream

    The Eyewitness News opening plays, then fades away to Bruce
    and Susan.

              I'm Susan Ortega.

              I'm Bruce Nolan and here's what's
              m ak i n g n e ws --
    And the screen goes to STATIC. Lights dim in the studio.

              What happened? What the hell
              happened?
    The Stage Manager listens to his wire.

              We lost the signal. It's another
              power surge.

              Aw, geez. Ever since that damn
              asteroid hit.
    The power comes back up.

              We're back.


              We apologize for the interruption,
              and now back to the news. Bruce. . .

              Thank you, Susan--
    Susan gets a feed in her earpiece.






          I'm sorry, we're going live to Rupp
          arena where the Buffalo Sabers have
          won the Stanley cup. Fred...
Bruce is noticeably bothered.




Fred is with the coach. The team is celebrating, champagne
rains down.

          Thank's Susan. I'm here with coach
          Tucker who has lead the Sabers to
          their first championship in 22
          years...
ON BRUCE'S mounting frustration. He gives a look.

          Tell me coach...
Fred's face registers A PAINED LOOK. He tries to keep it
together. A beat of silence...

               
          I have to use the restroom.
He drops the mic and runs out. Off the coach's puzzled
look...


          What the hell?
Bruce covers.

          We'll get back to the Saber victory
          in just a moment. In other news--
Again, STATIC... Jack tosses his headset.

          Oh, for the love of Godl What is
          it now?
The Stage Manager again listens to his wire.






          The whole booth is down.
CRASH! A BRICK flies through a front window.       Bruce turns to
see...


A FULL ON RIOT in progress. College students, city dwellers
going crazy. Cars are burning, people are out of control.
Escaped convicts are running in and out of stores looting
right alongside ordinary citizens.
The Kowolski brothers and Momma Kowolski are helpless against
the onslaught as pillagers run out of the bakery carrying
cakes, pies, bread - whatever they can get their hands on.
Bruce stumbles through the mayhem, confused.

          What's going on?

          Partying, man. Wooooll!!     Sabers I!
They continue to trash the area.

          But your team wonl
Cars are being rolled over. A lone POLICE OFFICER protects
himself with his shield as he's pelted with various debris.
The Officer PULLS BRUCE down behind a car.

          Stay down.


          Where are the other officers?


          What other    officers? Half the
          force just    retired. Said their
          "ship came    in." You better get
          home pal. I   t's dangerous out here.
The Officer heads out. Bruce stands, then quickly DUCKS, as
a bottle is tossed through a window that has a lotto sticker
on it.






           The lottery sucks!    I only won 17
           bucks i


Bruce looks up at a burning building with a flaming "Mr.
Exclusive" billboard above - it comes CRASHING DOWN. Bruce
looks out over the rioters.


We see the anger build in his face, like Moses looking down
on the Israelites. He RAISES HIS ARMS. DARK CLOUDS SWIRL IN



           Hear, O' Buffalo, you have awakened
           my wrath. Vengeance is mine!
A BOLT OF LIGHTENING shoots right into the middle of the
rioters, scattering them. People flee in every direction as
THUNDER CRASHES and lightning bolts continue to strike.
Bruce stands alone in the street, surveys the smoldering
mayhem, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the key
God gave him. He grips it tightly and...


Bruce stands there, sees God as he originally found him,
mopping. God looks up at Bruce, not surprised to see him.

           They're all out of control. I
           don't know what to do.

           You mind giving me a hand with this
           floor first?
Off Bruce's look. . .


Bruce's sleeves rolled up, mopping next to God.

           "Poor man wanna be rich, rich man                     *
           wanna be king, king's disatisfied                     *

          in my head while I'm workin'...                       *
They finish up.   God looks back at the sparkling floor,
satisfied.

          There we go. Wonderful thing. No
          matter how filthy something gets,
          it can always be cleaned right up.
God collects Bruce's mop.

          What happened? I gave everyone
          what they wanted.
God sets the mops down.

          Since when does anyone have a clue
          about what they want?
God holds up a REMOTE AND CLICKS, changing the room into the
DINER where Bruce first parted his soup. (NOTE: Whenever the
room "changes" we're actually still in the room, but seeing a
full projection of an environment on the walls and columns)
The older waitress, Ginnie, clears some dishes...

          Remember Ginnie?
Ginnie bends down behind the counter and when she comes back
up she is a hot 21 YEAR OLD.

          Ginnie thought she lost her beauty
          when she got older. I'm trying to
          convince her otherwise.
Ginnie bends down again, and when she comes back up, she is
HER OLDER SELF again.
God clicks the remote, changing the environment into a SCHOOL
YARD. We see the grade school where Filbert Davis, the boy
Bruce helped up the rope, is in a fight.

          Ah yes, Filbert. Brilliant young
          man. He was going to be a great
          poet.




                     GOD 
          The soul of his work would have
          been built out of his hardships.
          He would have touched millions.
               
          But now he's headed for a career as
          a professional wrestler.
God clicks, changing the environment into a CONDO. We see a
lonely woman  sitting
depressed, rocking in a chair.

          Ester Maha. I love Ester. Ester
          was bankrupt. She was going to
          have to eat her pride and call her
          sister. Would've got the two of
          them together again. Instead, she
          bought a condo in Florida.

God clicks the remote again...


               (recalling Bruce's own
                words)                                          *

God smiles, asks him again what he asked him in the alley...   *

          You want some advice?                                    *

God smiles, starts to walk away...                                 *

          Everybody wants a miracle, Bruce.                        *

          But what they don't understand is,
          they're the one's holding the
          power.
God claps the bright ceiling light on, walks over to the
latter.

          Wait. Where are you going?

          This is good-bye, Bruce. You've
          learned a lot. I think you should
          be able to handle things now.
God climbs, ascending into the light.

          What if I have a question? What if
          I need you?
God stops, looks down to Bruce.





          See Bruce, that's your problem.
          That's everybody's problem. You
          keep looking up. . .
He smiles and disappears into the light, leaves Bruce
thinking.

Bruce stands in the apartment, Sam at his side. No signs of
Grace. The bed is made. Empty.
Then, he notices the BOX OF PHOTOS, the incomplete albums.
He picks up a photo of he and Grace in an even tinier
apartment, Sam is a puppy, they have little money, and
despite it all look very happy. Bruce smiles at the memory.
Reaches for a stack of photos...

Bruce sits in bumper to bumper traffic. A man's car is
broken down in the middle of the street causing the
bottleneck.
Bruce sees THE SIGN GUY by the side of the road.   His sign
reads: ALL FOR WON.
Bruce looks out at the other drivers honking and shouting at
the frustrated man.
CUT TO - the stalled car is now rolling to the shoulder and
we REVEAL that Bruce is doing the pushing.


The auto-function is answering "YES" to the prayer emails.
Bruce clicks cancel, turns off the computer.

Filbert Davis is beating up another kid. Bruce watches at a.
distance.

          Bruce giveth and Bruce taketh away.
Suddenly, Filbert goes to throw a punch but his punch has no
sting. The bigger boy looks down and grins.






The teacher stands before the class, reading a student's
paper.

          "Pain". By Filbert Davis.
As she reads the poem, PAN TO Filbert Davis seated in class
with a ripe BLACK EYE.

Bruce is waiting for Sam to pee.


          Come on, Sam. Let's do this the
          right way... Oh, alright...
Bruce pulls out a SWATCH OF CARPET, lays it on the grass.
Sam happily goes. They walk off together.

          That's not normal you know.

Bobby places three blue home address number tiles on the
counter - all number 6.

              
          Do you have these in red?
Bruce walks up behind Bobby.

          Okay Bobby, it's time to come back.
Bobby HISSES at Bruce, turns INSANELY DEMONIC.



          YOUR SOUL!It


               
          Un-damn you, Bobby.
Bobby instantly transforms to normal.





          Hey thanks, Bruce.
               
          Biscotti?

Evan is packing his things at his desk, still looking much
worse for the wear. Bruce walks up to him.

          You're probably here to gloat over
          the anchor position. Go ahead, I'm
          sure I deserve it.

          You know, Evan.    I've been a real
          prick.
Evan stops, looks up at Bruce, confused.

          You were born to anchor. I'm not
          taking the position. Oh, and I
          never really congratulated you on
          getting the job in the first place.
          Congratulations, Evan.
Bruce offers his hand, Evan takes it. When their hands meet,
there is a kind of ELECTRICAL CHARGE that passes between
them. Bruce walks off, Evan is confused when he catches his
reflection in the mirror. HE'S BACK TO NORMAL!



Evan is manning the anchor desk and looking good doing it.
Jack is relieved.

          In the financial world, things are
          settling back to normal in what
          analysts are calling a fluke market
          fluctuation...
Bruce enters.

          You made the right choice, Jack.






                So what about you? What will you
                do?

                With your permission, I think I'll
                go out there and make the people
                laugh. To quote a friend, "God
                knows we could use it."
Jack smiles.

                Permission granted.
Bruce turns to go, then turns back.

                Oh, are you hungry? I know a place
                that makes a mean tomato soup.

Bruce walks along side Jack. Jack talks and talks, happy to
have the company. Bruce opens a door for Jack, leading to..

Bruce and Jack take a seat at the counter.

                Coffee, gentlemen?
Jack and the waitress lock eyes - there's an instant
attraction. Bruce smiles.

                Jack. This is a friend of mine,
                Cindy. Cindy this is Jack.

      
Hi.                                   Hi.


His sign reads:





PULL BACK to reveal BRUCE, sitting next to him with his own
sign reading:
"WHATEVER fl£ SAID"

With a little arrow pointing to the Homeless Sign Guy.


Bruce paces, waiting for Sam.

          You can do it, Sam. Without the
          carpet. Come on.
Sam does. Bruce celebrates, does a happy dance and is
surprised to see Debbie standing there.

               
          Looks like your rain dance worked.

          Debbie. Hey. You know, I never
          got to apologize for--

          I didn't really come to chat, I
          came for Grace's things.


Debbie is packing items into a box. She sees the photo
albums on the coffee table. She flips through, surprised.

          They're full... You did all this?
Bruce nods. Debbie looks at Bruce, sizing him up.

          You really hurt her, you know.

          I know.
Debbie starts to go, but turns back.

          You know what I do before I go to
          sleep every night? I tuck my kids
          in bed, I eat a scoop of ice cream
          and watch Conan.




                     DEBBIE 
          You know what Grace does? She
          prays. Most of the time for you.
This not only touches Bruce, but it gives him an idea.

Bruce sits anxiously at the computer with Sam, checks the e--
mails and types in GRACE CONNELLY. He hits "search". 1,273
entries appear.

          The woman does pray a lot.
He types in "Grace and Bruce" and eagerly awaits. There are
335 matches. He checks a few...
     "Dear God, please help Bruce to find himself, find
     contentment, find You."
     "Dear God, please help Bruce. He's struggling to find
     meaning."
     "Dear God, help Bruce to be happy. He can't seem to
     find his way..."
Over and over, he finds the same prayer, the same entry every
morning and night for months on end.
Bruce is touched.

          She still loves me, Buddy.
He KISSES SAM and races out.

Bruce stands in front of the house with flowers, another
special creation. He looks at the lavish bouquet, then sets
them down, picks a single, normal Daisy from the garden.
Better.
He heads for the door when he hears crying. It's Grace. He
looks up, sees a light on in the upstairs guest room.
He climbs the fire escape and looks in the window.
GRACE is sitting on the bed crying. As Bruce watches her
cry, feeling her emotion, it starts to LIGHTLY RAIN.

          Please God. Please...





Through her tears she is praying.     Bruce looks at her with
total love.

             Please God. I still love him...
Bruce smiles, thankful.

             ...but I don't want to love him
             anymore. Please God. Help me to
             forget.
                  
             I don't want to hurt anymore. I
             want to forget.
Bruce just stands there, stunned. He gets it. He raises a
hand, and with a simple wave, he performs an excruciatingly
selfless act. He lets Grace go.

Her face changes.     She wipes her eyes.   The pain is lifted.
And it is Bruce now who feels that pain. He looks at Grace.
A sad smile.


Rain droplets splash on the river where Bruce first raged at
God. He stands in the middle of the street, looks up
heavenward, weakly. Humble.

             You win. I' m done. Please. I
             don't want to do this anymore. I
             don't want to be God.
                  
             Please, help me.
And with that, the rain stops. The dark clouds slowly open
as beams of light cut through, shining down upon Bruce,
birds begin to chirp.adding to this magical moment as. . .


A MAC TRUCK SLAMS THROUGH FRAME, MOWS BRUCE DOWN. His spirit
remains in the same spot, looking confused, then STREAKS UP
heavenward.






SHOOTING HEAVENWARD like a missile, THROUGH THE CLOUDS,
THROUGH THE SKY to...

A HUGE WHITE ROOM - No walls, just white as far as the eye
can see. The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds.
Bruce finds himself standing there. He looks around and when
he turns behind him, he sees GOD. Floating on nothing, as
though sitting in the most royal throne.

          Am I...?

          You can't expect to kneel down in
          the middle of a highway and live to
          talk about it.

          But why? Why now?

          I work in mysterious ways, son.
A beat as Bruce takes everything in.

          You knew it all along. You knew if
          I got everything I wanted, I would
          ruin my life.
God doesn't respond, just listens.

          So I'm dead... Okay. If this is
          what you want. Okay, okay...
God holds up the PRAYER BEADS, tosses them to Bruce. Bruce
looks at the beads, then up at God, puzzled.

          Go ahead, use 'em.

          Alright... I've learned that I
          don't know as much I thought I
          did...

          Boy, you can say that again.

          Hey, I'm praying here.





          Sorry, go.

          If I could have just one thing in
          the world. It would be for Grace
          to live a happy, joyful life. And
          that she finds someone...
              (getting emotional as he
               realizes what he's
               saying)
          ...that she finds someone that will
          treat her with the love and respect
          that she so deserves.
God smiles the most satisfied of smiles.

          Now that is a prayer.
               
          Well, I better get on that one.
          See ya, Bruce.
Off Bruce's puzzled reaction he DROPS THROUGH THE CLOUDS --
FALLING POV - BACK DOWN TOWARDS EARTH, back THROUGH THE
CLOUDS, and right INTO ANOTHER WHITE ROOM where...
BRUCE EYES OPEN and he GASPS FOR BREATH.    The PRAYER BEADS
still clutched tightly in his hand.
TWO DOCTORS stop giving Bruce CPR, see that his vitals have
returned. . .

          He's back!

          BP 40 over 110 and rising.

                -
          Bruce? Can you hear me?
               
          We almost lost you there.
WIDER ANGLE - The WHITE ROOM is a HOSPITAL ROOM - Bruce is
heavily bruised and bandaged.

          You lost a lot of blood. It wasn't
          easy to find a match - you're a
          very rare blood type.





Bruce looks to the blood bag, sees "A/B Positive" written on
the side.



               
          A/B Positive...

          You should thank God for donors.
          We don't have a lot of that type on
          hand.

          There's your angel now.
Bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees...


A cotton swab taped to her arm. Now he remembers where he
heard of that blood type.

               
          I hear that all of this winds up in
          a warehouse somewhere. But you
          know me, I'm a sucker for this
          stuff.
The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go, leaving
the two of them alone. Grace tentatively approaches.

          I don't even know what I'm doing
          here. But... When I heard that
          you'd been in an accident and that
          you might not make it. . .
She starts to cry.

          Hey, I'm okay.

          Does it hurt?

          Only when I talk., and smile... and
          y'know, exist in general.





Grace laughs. That's one thing Bruce could always do, is
make her laugh. Grace spots the prayer beads in Bruce's
hand, raises his arm.

          Oh my gosh, you still have those?
Bruce looks at the prayer beads, then looks at Grace. He
remembers his prayer to God and the emotion wells within him

          What is it?

          Nothing. It's just really nice to
          see you.
She goes to him, Bruce sits up a bit and they embrace.


A BIG BLOOD DRIVE in progre   ss. Everyone is there, Grace,
Sam, Debbie and Zoe, Ginnie   and Jack, the Kowolski brothers,
Momma Kowolski, Evan, Susan   , Dallas, Fred. Bobby serves
various food items from his   cart.

          You know, French Toast was invented
          by tavern owner, Joseph French, who
          had a poor knowledge of grammar,
          and did not know how to use the
          possessive apostrophe, so he called
          it French Toast instead of French's
          Toast...
Pull back to reveal BRUCE, crutch under one arm, cast on his
leg, mic in hand, reporting. He's now talking in his OWN
VOICE, much more himself.

          This is Bruce Nolan at Buffalo's
          first annual "Be the Miracle" blood
          drive. Remember, the life you save
          may be mine, so hurry down. I had
          a close call and, well, can you
          imagine what life would have been
          like without me?
Laughs in the background, from the people that know Bruce.
Bruce walks over to the Kowolski Brothers.






          In honor of this event, the
          Kowolski brothers have baked a one-
          of-a-kind, creation.
The brothers proudly unveil the special cookie and we see
that it's a HUGE SYRINGE SHAPED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE.

          Sure, a little creepy and a
          shameless plug, but we love 'em.
              (Bruce breaks off a little
               piece, takes a bite)
          Mmm, good needle. Remember, that's
          Kowolski's bakery. The bakery that
          gets more air time than a high
          speed chase.
Everyone laughs.   The Kowolski brothers beam.
Bruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve,
revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist. She ties
off his arm, starts to probe for a vein.


          To be honest, I've never been a big
          fan of shots. . .
The volunteer now is swabbing Bruce's arm and Bruce is
starting to sweat.

              
          Okay, we're good to go...They just
          stick it into my arm. Breaking
          through the skin, of course...
The volunteer pulls out the needle and Bruce PASSES OUT COLD.
Gasps, the Nurse leans close, total silence, then:



Bruce jolts awake making the Nurse and several people jump.
They all laugh.


          Had you going, didn't IIIIII1

He reacts to the nurse POKING the needle in. Everyone laughs
more.





           No, this is nothing. In fact, this
           is the second time I've given blood
           this week. For those of you who
           haven't heard, I ' d like you to meet
           the soon to be Mrs. Exclusive.
He throws a look to Grace who smiles in return.    The crowd
applauds.

           This is Bruce Nolan reporting for
           Eyewitness News.
The camera cuts.   Bruce lowers his mic, turns to Grace.

           So, what'd you think?

           I don't know, I thought it was very                   *
           pleasurable.                                          *
Bruce smiles, they kiss...
As the blood drive continues, we push through the crowd,
heading somewhere. Bodies clear frame and we see the
HOMELESS MAN sitting on a park bench. His sign reads:

The Homeless Man smiles into camera. We continue forward and
in a slow, mysterious, subtle fashion his face slowly
transforms into the very pleased, FACE OF GOD, who winks and
w. . .
