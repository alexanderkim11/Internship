          It's Election Day 1997. Up and down the country, the PEOPLE
          OF BRITAIN, people of all shapes and sizes and denominations,
          black and white, young and old, are going to the Polls.

          Everyone, that is, except the people that live in...




          The most instantly recognisable Palace in the world.

          The Royal Standard, (the flag of heraldic lions and symbolic
          harp-strings that signals the Monarch's presence), flutters
          on the roof.




          We're in a state room at Buckingham Palace. A TV plays in the
          corner..


                     ..here's Tony Blair, just 43 years
                   old, arriving at the polling station
                   of his constituency in Sedgefield.."

          QUEEN ELIZABETH II, wearing formal robes of the Garter, is
          posing for an official portrait by an elderly black PORTRAIT
          ARTIST, (representative, one assumes, of one of the many
          Charities of which she is patron)..



                     Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford?



                           
                     Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they
                    opened. First in line. Seven o'clock.



                    If he wins, he'll be the youngest
                   Prime Minister in almost two hundred
                   years.."

          He straightens..


                   And I don't mind telling you, it
                   wasn't for Mr Blair.


                   Not a moderniser, then?




                   Certainly not. We're in danger of
                   losing too much that's good about this
                   country as it is.


                   "The only questions that still remain:
                   how big will his landslide be? And how
                   extensive, how sweeping will the
                   modernisation programme be that he
                   ushers in?"


                   Hmm.

          The QUEEN watches as he paints..


                   I rather envy you being able to vote.
                        
                   Not the actual ticking of the box,
                   although, I suppose, it would be nice
                   to experience that ONCE.
                        
                   But the sheer joy of being partial.


                   Yes..

          The ARTIST squints as he scrutinises the canvass..


                   One forgets that as Sovereign, you are
                   not entitled to vote.


                   No.


                   Still, you won't catch me feeling
                   sorry for you. You might not be
                   allowed to vote, Ma'am..
                        
                   But it IS your Government.


                   Yes.

          The QUEEN raises her eyebrow..


                   I suppose that is some consolation.














          The QUEEN's face. Fast asleep. It's shortly before 8.00 am.
          Daylight filters through the curtains. As does something
          else..

          The stirring sound of bagpipes..




          The inner courtyard of Buckingham Palace. In a ritual
          unchanged since Queen Victoria, a uniformed PIPER, wearing a
          kilt of Ancient Hunting Stuart tartan, marches under her
          Majesty's windows, playing the bagpipes.

           t's her morning alarm call, and it's the way she wakes up
          wherever she is - anywhere in the world.




          Darkness. A soft knock at the door. (The strains of bagpipes
          can still be heard from below). Her Majesty's DRESSER sticks
          her head round the corner, with a calling tray of Earl Grey
          tea and the newspapers.


                   G'morning, Ma'am.

          The DRESSER puts the tea and newspapers on a bedside table.


                  Shall I draw the curtains?

          The QUEEN's sleepy voice answers..`Please'. The DRESSER goes
          to the window.


                   Did you stay up?


                   Yes, Ma'am.


                   And? Was it as expected..?

          The QUEEN's hand reaches for spectacles, then for the
          newspapers. She puts on her glasses.


                   Yes, Ma'am. Mr Blair, by a landslide.

          The QUEEN's expression changes..








                   I see.

          She lifts the newspaper up. The front page comes into sharp
          focus.

          FULL FRAME: the beaming smile of TONY BLAIR, the new Prime
          Minister. The QUEEN stares back. Their eyes meet - as it
          were. Headlines tell us..






          The QUEEN sits at breakfast. Reading the newspapers. Dogs
          under the table. A knock on the door, and ROBIN JANVRIN,
          , her deputy Private Secretary, pops around..


                   The Prime Minister is on his way,
                   Ma'am.


                   To BE, Robin.
                        
                   Prime Minister to BE.

          The QUEEN frostily flicks a page, without looking up..

                                ELIZABETH 
                   He hasn't asked my permission yet.




          The QUEEN and JANVRIN walk through a corridor of the Palace.
          It has the air of a grand hotel. Chintz. Flock. Long, gilded
          mirrors. Portraits on the walls..


                   He's a hard one to read, isn't he?


                   Yes. On the one hand his background is
                   quite establishment. Father a
                   Conservative. A public school
                   education at Fettes, where he was
                   tutored by the same man as the Prince
                   of Wales.


                   Well, we'll try not to hold that
                   against him.









                   On the other, his manifesto promises
                   the most radical modernisation and
                   shake-up of the Constitution in three
                   hundred years.


                   Oh. Is he going to `modernise' us, do
                   you think?


                   I wouldn't put it past him. He's
                   married to a woman with known anti-
                   Monarchist sympathies - you may
                   remember her curtsey the first time
                   you met. It could best be described as
                   `shallow'.


                   I don't measure the depth of a
                   curtsey, Robin. I leave that to my
                   sister.


                   And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary
                   who said he was expecting the
                   atmosphere at Downing Street to be
                   very informal. Everyone on first name
                   terms.
                        
                   At the Prime Minister's insistence.


                   What? As in `Call me Tony?'


                   Yes.

          The QUEEN's face puckers in distaste..


                   Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of
                   that.
                         
                   Have we sent him a protocol sheet?




          ARCHIVE FOOTAGE: as TONY BLAIR's motorcade drives down the





          The motorcade sweeps into the grand, inner quadrangle of
          Buckingham Palace, and stops at the King's door.










          Three secret service BODYGUARDS leap out and open the car
          doors. TONY looks out at the palace..


                   Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.


                    hy? You've met her often enough
                   before.


                   I know. But never one to one. And
                   never as Prime Minister.


                   Remember, you're a man that's just
                   been elected by the whole country.


                   Yes. But she's still, y'know..

          TONY looks up at the vast palace in front of him..


                   The Queen.




          A uniformed EQUERRY leads TONY and CHERIE through corridors,
          and up a grand staircase..


                   When we reach the audience room, I
                   will knock. We will not wait to be
                   called, we will go straight inside.
                   Standing by the door, we bow. From the
                   neck. I will introduce you. The Queen
                   will extend her hand, you go to her,
                   bow again, then shake her hand.

          TONY shoots his cuffs, `Right', clears his throat.

                                QUERRY 
                   Couple of other things. It's `Ma'am'
                   as in ham, not Ma'am as in farm.


                   Yes..


                   And when you're in the Presence, at no
                   point must you show your back.









                   The `Presence'?


                   Yes, Sir. That's what it's called,
                   when you're in her Majesty's company.

           TONY turns, shoots a look at CHERIE, who sticks her fingers
          down her throat. TONY smiles back..

          The EQUERRY reaches a grand door, and knocks gently. Without
          waiting for a reply, he enters..

          CHERIE is left in the corridor. Alone. She stares at a
          liveried FOOTMAN.

          He stares back. No life behind his eyes. CHERIE takes a seat
          on a chair. Eyes widen to herself.




          TONY and the EQUERRY enter, and gently bow their heads. The
          EQUERRY then straightens, and announces..


                   Mr Blair, your Majesty.

          The QUEEN extends her hand. TONY walks forward, and shakes
          it. The EQUERRY leaves. The door is then closed.


                    ongratulations.


                   Thank you, Ma'am.


                   Your children must be very proud.


                   I hope so.


                   You've three, haven't you?


                   That's right.


                   How lovely. Such a blessing. Children.

          The QUEEN and TONY take their seats..


                   So..Have we shown you how to start a
                   nuclear war yet?









                         
                   No.


                   First thing we do, I believe.
                         a beat)
                   Then we take your passport and spend
                   the rest of the time sending you
                   around the world.


                   You obviously know my job better than
                   I do.


                   Well, you are my tenth Prime Minister,
                   Mr Blair. I'd like to think there
                   weren't too many surprises left. My
                   first was Winston Churchill. He sat in
                   your chair, in frock coat and top hat,
                   and was kind enough to give a shy

                   young girl like me quite an education.


                   I can imagine.


                    ith time, one has hopefully added
                   experience to that education, and a
                   little wisdom - better enabling us to
                   execute our constitutional
                   responsibility.
                        
                   To advise, guide and warn the
                   government of the day.


                   Advice which I look forward to
                   receiving.


                    ell, we will save that for our weekly
                   meetings.
                         a beat)
                   Now, if there's nothing else, I
                   believe we have some business to
                   attend to..

          TONY stares, then clicks..


                   Of course..

          He falls, rather extravagantly, on bended knee. The
          supplicant position of deference...









                   Your Majesty, the country has
                   spoken...and I come now to ask your
                   permiss..   E

                        
                   No, no, no. It's usual for ME to ask
                   the questions.

           TONY winces. Wishes the ground would swallow him up.


                   Mr Blair, the people have elected you
                   to be their leader. And so the duty
                   falls on me, as your Sovereign, to ask
                   you to become Prime Minister, and form
                   a government in my name.

           TONY stares. Lost for words. Then..


                   Generally, this is where you say
                   `yes.'


                   `Yes'.

          The QUEEN extends her hand, which TONY kisses. She withdraws
          it again - quite sharply, then DISCREETLY PRESSES A BUZZER by
          her chair indicating the ceremony is over. The EQUERRY opens
          a door, and CHERIE is invited inside.

                               ELIZABETH 
                   How nice to see you again, Mrs Blair.

           HERIE curtseys awkwardly, reluctantly, shallowly..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   You must be very proud.


                   Yes.


                   And exhausted, I imagine. Where will
                   you be spending the summer?


                   France.


                   How lovely.


                    ou'll be in Balmoral, I expect.









                   Yes, I can hardly wait. Wonderful
                   place.

          The QUEEN indicates a portrait of QUEEN VICTORIA..


                   My great, great grandmother said of it
                   - "In Balmoral all seems to breathe
                   freedom and peace and to make one
                   forget the world and its sad
                   turmoils."

           t that moment, the doors open, and JANVRIN enters, and
          whispers urgently in the QUEEN's ear. The QUEEN's face
          changes as she listens.

                                ELIZABETH 
                   Really..?

          Her expression changes. She frostily turns to the BLAIRS..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   I'm afraid we're going to have to
                   leave it there.

          With that the QUEEN shakes TONY's hand. TONY and CHERIE
          awkwardly back out of the royal presence, leaving The QUEEN
          and JANVRIN.


                   Not too short, was it? I gave him
                   fifteen minutes.
                        
                   One doesn't want to be rude.




          TONY and CHERIE walk down a corridor. CHERIE whispers under
          her breath..


                        
                   "Thank you so much for coming. Now
                   bugger off."


                   I know. What was all that about?


                   Diana. Apparently she's got a new
                   boyfriend.











          Of PRINCESS DIANA walking hand in hand with a dark-haired MAN
          in his late thirties..


                   Dodi Al-Fayed is the son of Egyptian
                   millionaire Mohammed Al-Fayed, a man
                   whom the English establishment has
                   repeatedly denied a British passport..



          DIANA and DODI kissing and canoodling on board the yacht
          `Jonikal'..


                   The Princess and Mr Fayed were hugging
                   and kissing in full view of the
                   world's press yesterday..




          DIANA and DODI on the yacht on their last holiday together..


                   ..the couple then left for Paris. At
                   one point, the Princess told gathered
                   reporters to watch out. Her next move
                   would really surprise them...






          PAPARAZZI are assembled outside the hotel. A few SPECTATORS
          too.




          Various NEWS REPORTERS are also broadcasting...


                        
                   ..the Princess of Wales and Dodi Fayed
                   returned to Paris earlier today..


                   ..where they visited a local jewellery
                   shop where unconfirmed reports
                   suggested Mr Fayed had been looking at
                   engagement rings..










          CCTV FOOTAGE: the unmistakable blonde hair of the PRINCESS of
          WALES as she enters the Ritz Hotel through revolving doors.



              German REPORTER continues..


                          
                     ...they have now been inside the hotel
                     for more than two hours. We believe
                     they have been dining in a suite on
                     the fifth floor..

          Presently a ripple of activity: DOORMEN furtively speak into
          walkie-talkies. Growing anticipation in the CROWD..

          An AMERICAN REPORTER turns to his camera..


                     We've just been told the Princess is
                     about to come out of the hotel..

          PAPARAZZI jostle roughly for position, and raise their
          cameras as the doors open, and a BLACK MERCEDES slides into
          position.




          Elsewhere in the hotel..

          The real DIANA, her BODYGUARD, DODI FAYED, and HENRI PAUL
          leave the public part of the hotel, and walk down a flight of
          stairs..




          Pandemonium breaks out as BODYGUARDS emerge from the hotel.
          Engines roar into life of the decoy black Mercedes.

          Doors slam. The CROWD surges. An explosion of flashlights.
          Tyres burn. The squeal of rubber as the MERCEDES pulls off.

          Swarms of PAPARAZZI give chase, kick-starting their
          motorcycles, speaking into cell-phones to their COLLEAGUES..











          The real ROYAL PARTY, meanwhile, walks briskly through an
          underground corridor which leads to the back door of the
          hotel..




          PAPARAZZI who were waiting at the back exit, speak to their
          COLLEAGUES on their cell phones, and are about to jump on
          their motorcycles to join them in the chase, when suddenly..

          HENRI PAUL, PRINCESS DIANA, her BODYGUARD and DODI FAYED
          emerge from a door, and climb into a waiting Mercedes. HENRI
          PAUL turns to the PAPARAZZI..


                        (in French, we see sub-
                         titles)
                   Don't bother following. You won't
                   catch us.

          The engine starts with a roar. The PAPARAZZI double-take, and
          frantically shout into their phones to their COLLEAGUES.
          `Wait! They've come out at the back.'




          The Mercedes pulls up at a traffic light.

          ALL AROUND THEM: the glare of Paparazzi motorcycles and
          camera flashbulbs around the car. The Paparazzi call out in
          French and Italian. They thump the window. It's terrifying.

          An explosion of flashing lights. Popping flashbulbs. The
          traffic light turns amber. DODI barks at the DRIVER..

          The DRIVER, a short squat man in glasses, (we do not see his
          face), slams his foot down.




          The car roars ahead, then speeds down into a tunnel, followed
          by the PAPARAZZI MOTORCYCLES.






          The Scottish Highlands. To establish.






          The silhouette of a magnificent ten year old STAG stands on a
          rock, and roars into the night.




          `RRRRrrrinnnnggg', the phone rings..

          A SILHOUETTE fumbles for a light switch, and hits the light.
          We immediately recognise the face. It's JANVRIN, the Queen's
          deputy Private Secretary.


                        
                   Robin Janvrin.

          He listens, then his expression changes.

                               ANVRIN 
                   What?

          He checks the clock on the bedside table, waking rapidly now.
          Deadly serious..

                                ANVRIN 
                   Right. I see.

          JANVRIN hangs up. Then urgently dials a number on the
          telephone..




                               JANVRIN 
                   I'm going to need to speak to her
                   Majesty. Right away.




           till pulling on clothes, JANVRIN rushes on foot towards the
          big house in the distance. Lights go on all over the darkened
          castle.




           ANVRIN and a middle-aged   DRESSER, (half-asleep and still
          rearranging her uniform),   walk urgently up the stairs towards
          the second floor corridor   where the QUEEN's bedroom is
          located. They pass a PAGE   on the way down..


                   Tell Sir Guy I'd like everyone in. As
                   soon as possible.

          The PAGE nods. Departs.










          A knock on the door. The door opens, and the DRESSER's voice
          gently calls out..


                   Ma'am?

           he QUEEN stirs in her bed..


                   Mr Janvrin is here to see you..


                   Oh..

          The QUEEN turns on the light. The DUKE of EDINBURGH flinches
          in irritation, scrunching his eyes as they are blinded..


                   What the..?




           he QUEEN emerges from her bedroom wearing an old-fashioned
          dressing-gown, and clutching a hottie, (a velour-covered
          Cosimax hot water bottle), to find ROBIN JANVRIN waiting..


                   Good evening, Ma'am. I'm sorry to
                   disturb..

          He clears his throat..



                    've just had a call from our Embassy
                   in Paris. It's...the Princess of
                   Wales.

          PRINCE PHILIP appears in the doorway. Irritable.


                   Why? What's she done now?




          "Rrrrrinng", the phone rings. We're in TONY BLAIR's
          constituency house in Trimdon, near Durham in northern
          England.

           Click', TONY, in T-shirt, turns on the light. His face is
          creased with sleep. He blinks..










                   What? How badly?

          The figure of CHERIE stirs in the bed. Groans. TONY listens
          to the voice at the other end..


                   I see. Who are we speaking to there?


                   Right.
                         shell-shocked)
                   Keep me posted.

          TONY hangs up. CHERIE turns..


                   It's Diana. She's been in a car
                   accident. In Paris.


                   Is it serious?


                   Apparently Dodi Fayed is dead.


                   What?

          CHERIE's face. Visibly shocked.   TONY has switched on the TV
          in the bedroom.


                   Let's just re-cap on what's happened.



           he QUEEN is sitting with the DUKE OF EDINBURGH.


                   What was she doing in Paris?


                    ou know what she's like.

          The QUEEN flicks channels, peering over her glasses, trying
          to catch the latest news on the television..

          At that moment CHARLES enters the room. His face ravaged with
          concern. It's the first time the QUEEN has seen him since
          news of the crisis..







                   It's quite awful...
                         (wants to console CHARLES
                          but finds it easier to
                          say..)
                   What are you going to do about the
                   boys?

          An awkward moment. Stifled..


                   Let them sleep until we know more.


                   Yes that's sensible.


                   I should go to Paris. I told my people
                   to start organising a jet.


                   What? A private one?


                   Yes.


                   Isn't that precisely the sort of
                   extravagance they attack us for?


                    ell, how else am I going to get to
                   Paris at this time of night? The
                   airport at Aberdeen will be closed.

          Presently, a voice from behind..


                   You can use the Royal Flight. They
                   keep one of the planes on permanent
                   stand-by.
                         deadpans)
                   In case I kick the bucket.


                   Out of the question. It's not a matter
                   of State.


                   What are you talking about?


                   Diana is no longer an HRH, nor a
                   member of the Royal Family. This is a
                   private matter.







                     She's mother to your grandchildren.

          The QUEEN MOTHER sits on the sofa next to PRINCE PHILIP..


                     That's the latest?


                     I don't know. I can't hear..
                          
                     Everyone's shouting!

          CHARLES stares in disbelief. Exits the room..




              television plays in the corner..


                     ..behind me, is the tunnel of the Pont
                     de l'Alma, which you reach by the
                     expressway along the Seine. It was
                     along here that the Mercedes carrying

                     Good evening, Sir.

          JANVRIN listens to what the person is saying at the other
          end. His expression changes..


                     Right.
                              ashen-faced)

          room where the ROYAL FAMILY is watching television.

           e clears his throat, knocks on the door..




          JANVRIN enters.

                     I'm afraid it's not good news.




          PRINCE CHARLES's face: he lets out a strangled cry, as he
          hears the news..


                     No!

          CHARLES roars in pain and disbelief. His knuckles whiten..


                     No, no, no, no..!

          In the doorway: STEPHEN LAMPORT, who has delivered the news,
          can hardly bear to watch..




          ON TV: struggling in vain to hold onto his composure, a
          BRITISH NEWSREADER relays the news, visibly in shock..

          tableau of shock.

              CNN ANCHOR breaks the news to a worldwide audience..


                     "I'm afraid we have some bad news to
                     report.."




          The CNN ANCHOR continues on TV.


                     "Diana, Princess of Wales, is dead."

          TONY BLAIR is watching on TV, sitting downstairs, having
          thrown on some clothes. He speaks on the phone..







                   What have I got on this week?




          ALASTAIR CAMPBELL, Press Secretary to TONY BLAIR, is dressed

          something intently.

           e REVERSE ANGLE to see: a half-open door. SILHOUETTES
          inside. The sound of male voices. Whispering. Speaking
          softly.

          It's the moment the BOYS are being told. We make out the
          SILHOUETTES hugging. The sound of tears. Soft voices. CHARLES
          repeatedly kissing his SONS.

           ur CAMERA stays on the QUEEN's FACE. A distant flicker of
          pain at the unrestrained intimacy and affection between them.

          Presently, the door opens, and a red-eyed PRINCE CHARLES
          emerges.











                   They're going to go back to sleep.
                        (clears his throat, speaks
                         with difficulty)
                   Well, try anyway.

          The QUEEN goes up to CHARLES and stiffly, poignantly, tries
          to touch him. But cannot. Is unable. She withdraws her hand.


                        
                   My Private Secretary's office has
                   found a travel agency open in New York
                   that will sell me a flight to Paris
                   with an hour's stop over in
                   Manchester.

          CHARLES contains himself with difficulty..


                   Perhaps now you might consider whether
                   it's still an extravagance to bring
                   back the mother of the future King of
                   England in one of our planes?


                        
                   All right.

           HARLES's eyes burn. He turns, and walks out.

          The QUEEN is left alone. She stares for a moment, then
          leaves, passing a FOOTMAN.


                        
                   I don't want the boys to see the news
                   and get upset. First thing tomorrow
                   morning, I want the radio taken out of
                   their bedroom, and the television
                   taken out of the nursery.

          The FOOTMAN bows..




          The QUEEN sits in bed, writing her diary, in a bedchamber
          where the decor is unchanged in a hundred years..

           utside, the sound of bird-song. The first rays of light.

          The DUKE OF EDINBURGH sticks his head around the corner. He
          looks at the QUEEN..


                   Well, well, well.







                   Ye-es.


                   Are you all right?

          A silence.

                               PRINCE PHILIP 
                   Your sister called about an hour ago.
                   From Tuscany.


                     hope you told her to come back? Cut
                   the holiday short?


                   I did.

          ELIZABETH raises her eyebrow..


                       an't imagine she was pleased.


                   That's putting it mildly.


                   What did she say?

          PHILIP smiles to himself recalling MARGARET's words..


                   Something about Diana managing to be
                   even more annoying dead than alive.

          The QUEEN looks up..


                   Just make sure the boys never hear you
                   talk like that.


                   Of course.

          PHILIP produces a bottle of pills from his dressing-gown
          pocket, and shakes them..

                               PRINCE PHILIP 
                   Something to help you go down?


                   No. I'm going to do my diary a little
                   longer.


                   Fine. I'll sleep next door.






          PHILIP touches her on the shoulder. But she doesn't
          reciprocate. He goes. The QUEEN appears to continue writing,
          but our CAMERA slowly turns to reveal her PEN is not moving.
          Nor writing.

          She's staring in thought.



            Victorian, red-brick house. In the driveway, the
          incongruous mix of a grey Renault Espace people-carrier and
          two POLICE VEHICLES.

          In the modest garden: two ARMED POLICE OFFICERS are playing
          football with three young CHILDREN..




          Inside the plain, unfashionably decorated house..

          The TV plays in the corner of the kitchen. CHERIE BLAIR,
          visibly upset, watches TV while cooking breakfast.

           TONY is not wearing his Newcastle shirt.

          TONY is reading out his statement which is written on a pad
          of paper, filled with crossings-out..


                   "..that's how she will remain. In our
                   minds, our hearts, forever."
                        
                   OK, got it.




          ALASTAIR CAMPBELL is in Downing Street, sits in an office,
          feet on a desk, staring at the TV..


                   Where will you do it?


                   I thought at church. On the way in.

          ON TV: breaking news: Diana's brother, EARL SPENCER, makes a
          statement from the gates outside his house in South Africa..


                   ...this is not a time for
                   recriminations, however I would say
                   that I always believed that the press
                   would kill her in the end.






                               SPENCER
                   But even I could not imagine that they
                   would take such a direct hand in her
                   death as seems to be the case. It
                   would appear that every proprietor and
                   editor of every publication that has
                   paid for intrusive and exploitative
                   photographs of her has blood on his
                   hands today...


                   Not the press, mate. You've got the
                   wrong villain.

          An AIDE appears in the doorway, catches TONY's eye, and
          indicates her watch..


                   I've got to go.


                   You about to speak to the Queen?


                   Yes.

          ALASTAIR shoots a mischievous look..


                   Ask her if SHE greased the brakes.


                   Now, now..

          TONY hangs up, crosses to the study, making sure the doors
          are shut so he won't be disturbed. We notice his shirt has
          no. 10 on the back, under the name, `BLAIR'.




           he QUEEN, PRINCE PHILIP and the QUEEN MOTHER sit in silence
          at the table, eating breakfast, stoically listening to radio
          coverage, soberly flicking through newspapers..

          The QUEEN is the only one who is fully dressed, (the others
          in bathrobes), and she wears black. She is reading "The
          Sunday Times".

          All around them the QUEEN's  MAIDS perform the
          choreography of service as the radio coverage continues. One
          MAID pours tea. Another brings fresh toast.

          Also present is the rather smarter VALET and MAID belonging
          to the PRINCE of WALES, and his separate HOUSEHOLD. They have
          a separate, , uniform of their own.

           hey set CHARLES's place and his breakfast, (nuts, grains,
          healthy food).









          A flamboyant napkin is folded into an elaborate fleur-du-lis,
          . The QUEEN turns
          to Charles's VALET..

          A knock on the door, JANVRIN enters, and bows in respect to
          the QUEEN..


                   I'm sorry to disturb, Ma'am, but I've
                   the Prime Minister, for you. From his
                   constituency.


                        (privately rolls eyes,
                         without looking up from
                         newspaper)
                   Lucky you.


                   Thank you, Robin. I'll take it next
                   door.

           he QUEEN gets to her feet and walks out into..




          The first-floor corridor. STAFF flatten themselves against
          the wall, averting their eyes as..

          The QUEEN unexpectedly comes out of the dining-room, walks
          along the corridor, and disappears into..




          The QUEEN's study. High ceilings, portraits, stag's antlers
          on the wall. The QUEEN picks up the phone..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   Good morning, Prime Minister.




          The contrast in surroundings could hardly be greater. TONY
          sitting in a cramped room, surrounded by toys, in track suit,
          in a working-class house..


                   Good morning, your Majesty. May I say
                   right away how very sorry I am - and
                   that the thoughts and prayers of my
                   family are with you at this terrible
                   time and with the two princes in
                   particular.








                   Thank you.

           HERIE appears in the doorway.


                   Is it your intention to make some kind
                   of appearance. Or statement?


                   Certainly not.




          The QUEEN's face, bristling at the suggestion. (WE INTERCUT



                   No member of the Royal family will
                   speak publicly about this. It is a
                   private matter and we would all
                   appreciate it if it could be respected
                   as such.


                   I see.

          TONY straightens, taken aback..


                   I don't suppose anyone has had time to
                   think about the funeral yet?


                   We've spoken to the Spencer family,
                   and it's their wish..
                        
                   ..their express wish, that it should
                   be a private funeral. With a memorial
                   service to follow in a month, or so.


                   Right.

          TONY shoots a look at CHERIE..


                   Given that Diana was no longer a
                   member of the Royal Family we have no
                   choice but to respect their wishes.


                   I see.

           TONY shoots a look at CHERIE..







                   You don't feel that in view of her
                   high profile and popularity..

                          choosing his words
                          carefully)
                   ...it might be an idea to pay tribute
                   to her life and achievements?
                        
                   Or even just to her as a mother?

          The QUEEN's face freezes over.


                   As I said. That's the Spencers' wish.

                               TONY 
                   And the public, Ma'am? The British
                   People?

          TONY hesitates..


                   You don't think a private funeral
                   would be denying them a chance..


                    hance to what..?


                   To share in the grief?

          The QUEEN's face: did she hear right?


                   It's a family funeral, Mr. Blair. Not
                   a fairground attraction.
                        
                   I think the Princess has already paid
                   a high enough price for exposure to
                   the press, don't you?

          PRINCE PHILIP enters, dressed and ready for church. He
          indicates his watch..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   Now, if there is nothing else I must
                   get on. The children have to be looked
                   after.


                   Of course.

          `Click', the QUEEN hangs up. TONY stares at the receiver.

                               TONY 
                   Good bye, Your Majesty.







          He puts down the phone...


                   Her instinct is to do nothing. Say
                   nothing. And give her a private
                   funeral.


                   Are you surprised? She hated her guts.


                   Well, I think it's a mistake.

          TONY's face becomes dark..


                   They screwed up her life. Let's hope
                   they don't screw up her death.




           veryone is getting ready to go to church. The QUEEN and
          QUEEN MOTHER are putting on their hats. PRINCE PHILIP, in
          full Highland regalia and black tie, helps both LADIES into
          their long coats...


                   The Chaplain called. Wanted to know
                   whether he should make any changes to
                   the service or make special mention of
                   Diana.


                   What did you say?


                   I told him he shouldn't change a
                   thing.



                    uite right.


                   I think the less fuss one makes, or
                   draws attention to it, the better.
                         she lowers her voice, as
                         the PRINCES approach from
                         the saloon with CHARLES)
                   For the boys.


                   Yes.


                   And we should probably arrange some
                   company for them. Some young people.







                   I'll take them for a long walk this
                   afternoon. Up Craggy Head.


                   Good. They'd like that.

           RINCE PHILIP opens the doors..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   But no guns. It's Sunday.

          They walk off to the waiting CARS..




          Offices BUSY FOR SUNDAY. Bustling AIDES and SECRETARIES. The
          engine room of Government. An AIDE sticks his head round a
          door, and calls down the corridor to...


                   Alastair? He's on..

          CAMPBELL turns, and excuses himself from his conversation,
          walks back down the corridor..




          ALASTAIR enters a press `monitoring' room, where several
          televisions are playing. One or two AIDES are busy working..

          ON TV: TONY, wearing a dark suit, and tie, takes his position
          in front of the statue of the Virgin Mary, in front of the
          cameras.




          TONY steps closer to the microphones, then..


                    e are today a nation in a state of
                   shock, in mourning, in grief that is
                   so deeply painful to us. People
                   everywhere, not just here in Britain,
                   kept faith with Princess Diana..




          JANVRIN watches the broadcast on television, surrounded by
          several MEMBERS OF STAFF - MAIDS, COOKS, VALETS, FOOTMEN, all
          craning their necks, watching the television in the Private
          Secretary's room..






          Our camera stays on JANVRIN's face, as TONY's speech
          continues..


                    They liked her, they loved her, they
                   regarded her as one of the people. She
                   was the people's princess, and that is
                   how she will stay, how she will remain

           ANVRIN's eyes roll privately..


                   A bit over the top, don't you think?

          JANVRIN turns, fully expecting everyone to agree..

          But instead all the STAFF MEMBERS behind him have tears
          rolling down their cheeks..




          Archive Footage.

          CHARLES's motorcade pulls up outside the hospital in Paris.
          Doors open. PRINCE CHARLES gets out..




          Shooting through the half-open door: we watch as the PRINCE
          of WALES disappears into the room. In the far corner, an open
          coffin.

           HARLES is visibly distressed. We hear the PRIEST's voice as
          he begins to pray..


                   Notre Pere qui es aux cieux,
                   Que ton nom soit sanctifie,
                   Que ton regne vienne,

                     ur la terre comme au ciel..

          In the corridor: hospital OFFICIALS quietly close the door in
          respect.

                   I'll always be glad I knew the
                   Princess, and hope everyone will
                   support her two fine sons and help
                   them have the life and the future she
                   would want..

                   I had the honour of hosting her a few
                   months ago when she visited our
                   country, and I was tremendously
                   impressed by her..

          The sound of a NEWSREADER's voice..


                   In cities all around the world,
                   shrines have been created, in a
                   spontaneous, worldwide outpouring of
                   grief.

           mages of NEW YORKERS laying flowers outside the British

          Karachi..




          TONY BLAIR is in a car on his way back down to London. The
          phone rings. He is travelling with an AIDE, who answers the
          phone, listens, then hands it to TONY..


                   Lord Airlie.


          TONY shoots a look, `Who?' The AIDE covers the phone..


                   The Lord Chamberlain. In charge of the
                   funeral. You're meeting him at the
                   airport.

          TONY nods. Takes the phone.


                   Lord Airlie.




          A rather formidable, handsome, aristocratic man with a
          military bearing, is driven in a car, speaking into a mobile
          phone..








                        
                   Prime Minister. I'm responsible for
                   organising all royal ceremonial
                   events...
                        
                   And there's simply no precedent for
                   the funeral of an ex-HRH.




          TONY privately rolls his eyes at the ridiculous upper-class
          pronunciation..


                   Then perhaps we should plan for any
                   contingency.


                   Yes. I've arranged a meeting tomorrow
                   morning at 10.00 at Buckingham Palace.
                   Officials from all three palaces,
                   representatives from the Spencer
                   Family, the emergency services.
                         a beat)
                   Would you send some of your people?


                   Absolutely. Of course.

          They hang up.


                        
                   `Preeecedent?'

           TONY rolls his eyes.


                   Where do they find these people?




          PRINCE CHARLES comes down the steps of his plane. He walks
          towards the line of OFFICIALS, among them TONY BLAIR who
          stands next to LORD AIRLIE. TONY and PRINCE CHARLES shake
          hands..


                   I'm so sorry, Sir. And if there's
                   anything I or my Government can do...

          CHARLES appears distracted. Miles away..








                   They stood up as we drove past...in
                   cafes...in restaurants. Removed their
                   hats. This was Paris. One of the
                   busiest cities in the world...and you
                   could hear a pin drop...


                   I imagine it will be the same here.


                   Yes...I imagine it will.

           HARLES looks at TONY..


                   The Palace would still prefer to see
                   it as a private funeral. What are your
                   feelings on that?



                        
                   I think that would present us with
                   difficulties.


                   So do I. My mother..
                        
                   ...the Queen, comes from a generation
                   not best equipped to...
                        
                   ...she grew up in the war...
                        
                   I think what we need, what the COUNTRY
                   needs is to be led by someone.."of
                   today". If you follow?
                        
                   Balmoral is..
                        (he gestures, `another
                         world')


                   I think I understand.

          CHARLES and TONY shake hands, then the PRINCE moves on...

          Meanwhile, in the background, DIANA's coffin is taken from
          the aeroplane by pall-bearers and loaded into a hearse.

           he coffin is draped in the ROYAL STANDARD....




          The QUEEN, PRINCE PHILIP and the QUEEN MOTHER watch
          television. It's the evening news..






          ON TV: PRINCE CHARLES is greeted by PRESIDENT CHIRAC on the
          steps of the hospital.


                   Have we heard from the Spencers again?
                   Have they made up their minds when the
                   funeral will be?


                   Not me. No one tells me anything.


                   The Prince of Wales spent half an hour
                   at the hospital. At 5.06, the party
                   left with Diana's coffin..


                    n our walk today, one of the ghillies
                   said he'd seen a large stag up at
                   Craghie Head.
                         a beat)
                   He reckoned fourteen points.


                   What? Really? We haven't had one that
                   big on this estate in years.


                   No. Quite.

          ON TV: CHARLES's plane arrives back in England.


                   Diana's coffin arrived back in London,
                   at RAF Northolt, two hours later..

          The QUEEN watches intently as CHARLES is greeted on the
          runway by TONY BLAIR, and the two men talk.

          A flicker of suspicion on the QUEEN's face..


                    nyway, I thought it might be a good
                   distraction. For the boys.


                   What? Stalking?

          The QUEEN looks up..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   Isn't it a bit soon?


                   I think anything that gets them
                   outside is a good idea.







                    arlier today, the Prime Minister made
                   a statement from his constituency..

          ON TV: TONY making his speech outside the church in Trimdon.
          We CLOSE on the QUEEN's face as she hears..


                   "They liked her. They loved her. They
                   regarded her as one of the People. She
                   was the People's Princess, and that is
                   how she will remain in our hearts
                   forever.."

          The QUEEN watches in disbelief. Her knuckles whiten.


                   I'm sorry, I can't bear it.
                         gets to her feet)
                   I'm going to bed.

          The QUEEN walks out.




          The following morning. A bare flagpole. No flag flying.

          But the flowers left by mourners outside the palace gates are
          growing.




          A large ceremonial room. Elaborate chinoiserie. Ming vases.
          Inside, some thirty or forty OFFICIALS, many uniformed, sit
          around a table. Among them: the CHIEF CONSTABLE of the
          METROPOLITAN police, the heads of the FIRE SERVICE and
          AMBULANCE SERVICE, military OFFICERS, representatives from
          the three palaces, Kensington Palace, , St
          James's Palace,  and Buckingham Palace, (the
          QUEEN's court), representatives from the Intelligence and
          Police Protection services, experts in protocol, and finally,
          representatives from the SPENCER FAMILY and Downing Street,
          .

           ORD AIRLIE, , checks the time.
          It's ten o'clock. He raps on a table, calling the meeting to
          order..


                   Right. It's ten o'clock. Let's make a
                   start. Thank you all for coming at
                   such notice. I think we all agree this
                   is an extraordinarily sensitive
                   occasion which presents us with
                   tremendous challenges logistically...

                   Oh, Christ..




          10, Downing Street. A car pulls up. ALASTAIR CAMPBELL gets
          out. Visibly in a bad mood.




          TONY BLAIR is in his office, surrounded by his AIDES, working
          in shirtsleeves.


                   "..after eighteen years of Opposition,
                   of frustration and despair, I am
                   proud, privileged, to stand before you
                   as the new Prime Minister..."


                   Labour Prime Minister..


                   "I want to set an ambitious course to
                   modernise this country. To breathe new
                   life into our institutions. To make
                   privilege something for the many, not
                   the few. So that we become nothing
                   less than a beacon to the world..."

          `Thump', the door opens, ALASTAIR CAMPBELL enters, clutching
          the day's newspapers..


                   Bloody hell! You think the Royals are
                   nutters! You should meet their
                   flunkeys! Two and a half-hours on
                   whether she should be carried in a
                   hearse or a gun-carriage.
                        
                   Anyway, raves in the press.

          ALASTAIR dumps the papers on the desk..









                   This lot call you "The Nation's
                   Mourner in Chief", this lot say you're
                   "The only person who has correctly
                   judged the mood of the country". Even
                   the "Mail"..
                        (disdainfully holding the
                         paper between finger and
                         thumb)
                   ..was impressed.

          ALASTAIR drops the papers on TONY's desk.


                   "People's Princess", mate. You owe me.

           LASTAIR goes. TONY watches, then jumps up, opens the door.
          His AIDE calls after him, covering the phone..


                   Gordon for you.


                   Tell him to hang on.




          TONY follows ALASTAIR out, calls after him..

                               TONY 
                   So it's decided? It's going to be a
                   public funeral.


                   Yes. On Saturday. A whopper. The
                   Abbey. The works.


                   Good. Has anyone told the Queen yet?


                   Dunno. No doubt some flunkey will be
                   despatched. Grovelling on all fours.

          TONY smiles imagining the prospect, goes back into his
          office.




          `Knock', a knock on the door, and ROBIN JANVRIN enters
          carrying a large file. He bows first to the QUEEN..


                   Good morning, Ma'am.







          ..then to the QUEEN MOTHER..


                   ..Ma'am.

          The QUEEN looks up..


                   What can we do for you, Robin?

          JANVRIN braces himself. This is not going to be easy...


                   Ma'am, there was a meeting at the
                   Palace this morning.


                   About the funeral arrangements, yes.


                   The Lord Chamberlain faxed over these
                   plans for you to consider.

          JANVRIN puts a large file on her desk..


                   There is now general agreement, Ma'am,
                   that a public funeral would be more
                   appropriate.


                   I see.

           he QUEEN perceptibly bristles..


                    nd what form will it take?


                   At the moment, they're suggesting..
                        
                   And of course these are early days..

          JANVRIN braces himself. Shoots a nervous look at the QUEEN


                               JANVRIN 
                   ...basing it on Tay Bridge.

          The QUEEN MOTHER looks up. Horrified.


                   Tay Bridge..?


                   What..?







          A stunned silence..


                   B-but that's the code name for my
                   funeral?    J

                    ndeed, Ma'am.
                         
                   But it would be for practical reasons
                   only.

          JANVRIN is dying.


                   It's the only one which has been..
                        
                   ..`rehearsed'. The only one that could
                   be put together..in time.

          The QUEEN MOTHER needs to sit down..


                   But I supervised those plans myself.


                   Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was
                   at pains to stress the spirit of the
                   occasion will be quite different.
                         a beat)
                   For example, in place of four hundred
                   soldiers marching behind the coffin,
                   the suggestion is that four hundred
                   representatives from the Princess's
                   various charities march behind the
                   coffin.


                   I see..

          The QUEEN MOTHER's eyes widen..


                   And that instead of foreign Heads of
                   State and Crown heads of Europe, the
                   guests would include a sprinkling of
                   actors of stage and screen, fashion
                   designers and other..
                        
                   ...celebrities..


                   Celebrities..?


                   Oh.








          The QUEEN looks ashen. The QUEEN MOTHER is pouring herself a
          drink..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   Wa..was there anything else?


                    o, Ma'am.

          JANVRIN bows, and leaves. Then stops, remembering..


                   Oh, yes. One other thing. The Police
                   Commissioner was keen that you
                   consider the idea of a condolence
                   book.
                         
                   It would give the growing crowds
                   something to do. Make marshalling them
                   easier.


                        
                   Yes, of course..

           ANVRIN reaches the door..


                   Oh, and the flowers.

           he QUEEN looks up..



                    hat flowers?

                               JANVRIN 
                   The flowers that have been left
                   outside Buckingham palace. Currently
                   they're blocking the path through the
                   main gate, and will make things
                   difficult for the Changing of the
                   Guard.


                   Fine. Then move them away.

           ANVRIN flinches slightly in anticipation..


                   Actually, the Lord Chamberlain was
                   wondering whether we shouldn't leave
                   the flowers, and send the Guards
                   through the North Gate.

          The QUEEN looks thrown..








                   Ye-es. Of course.
                         chastened)
                   Quite right.




          `Rrrrinng', the phone rings. TONY is sitting at his desk with
          one AIDE. A knock on the door. Another AIDE enters..


                    tephen Lamport on one.

          TONY looks up. Irritated at being disturbed..


                   Who?


                   The Prince of Wales's private
                   secretary. In Balmoral.
                         covering phone)
                   He said it was urgent.

          TONY rolls his eyes, then picks up the phone.


                    ood afternoon.


                   Good afternoon, Prime Minister.





           TEPHEN LAMPORT, Private Secretary to the Prince of Wales,
          sits at a desk. CHARLES is also present, listening..


                   The Prince of Wales wanted me to thank
                   you again for your kind words
                   yesterday.


                   Not at all.


                   He feels you and he...are modern
                   men...of similar mind...
                        
                   ...who could work well together at
                   this difficult time.

          TONY shoots a quizzical look..








                   Well, please thank his Highness, and
                   assure him that he can count on my
                   full support. At all times.
                        
                   Was that it?


                   Yes.

          TONY hangs up. He turns to his AIDE..

                               TONY 
                   Bizarre. Why is Charles doing this?


                   What?


                   Creeping up to me like this. He did it
                   at the airport when he asked me to
                   `deal' with his mother.


                    ecause he knows that if the Queen
                   continues to get it wrong over Diana,
                   it won't be long before the Royals
                   become public enemy no 1.

                          a beat)
                   Terrified of being shot, apparently.


                   Who, Charles?


                   His people have already been onto us
                   asking for extra protection.


                   He probably thinks if he's seen to be
                   on our side, the Queen will be the one
                   left in the firing line, not him.


                   What? So it's OK for his mother to
                   take the bullet, not him?
                         shakes head)
                   What a family.




          The QUEEN, in tatty old Barbour, head-scarf, Wellington
          boots, loads Corgis and picnic hampers into the back of an
          old Land Rover.








          She climbs into an old, muddy Jeep, and starts the oily,
          smoky diesel engine. As she begins to drive out, she turns a
          corner, and passes CHARLES who is climbing into his much
          smarter, luxury, leather-upholstered jeep..


                   Wait! Where are they?


                   Up at Craigghead.


                   I'll come with you.

          CHARLES climbs in. The QUEEN notices how extravagantly
          dressed he is. A kilt and tailored hunting jacket..

                               CHARLES 
                   Want me to drive?


                   Certainly not.

           HARLES shudders at the rough interior of the car, the mud-
          spattered windows, the hard, uncomfortable ride..


                   I thought you were going to get a new

                   one of these?


                   What for? It's perfectly all right.

          The engine splutters as she changes gear. The car lurches
          forward.




           he QUEEN drives hard through woods, dust kicking up in the
          old Land Rover's wake. It's a bone-shaking ride.

           HARLES stares out of the window, lost in thought..


                   I was thinking last night what Diana
                   might have done had it been me that
                   died in the tunnel in Paris.

          The QUEEN privately rolls her eyes..


                   She would certainly have taken the
                   boys to Paris. I rather regret not
                   doing that now.








                   What? And expose them to the media? It
                   would have been a dreadful thing to
                   do. They're much better off here.


                   Look, whatever else you may have
                   thought of Diana - she was a wonderful
                   mother.
                         a beat)
                   She adored those boys. And never let
                   them forget it.
                         a beat)
                   Always warm.

           he QUEEN's hands tighten on the steering wheel..


                   And physical.
                         a beat)
                   Never afraid to show her feelings.


                   Especially whenever a photographer was
                   in sight.


                   Yes, she MAY have encouraged all that,
                   but still..

          CHARLES looks out of the window. His eyes mist over..

                               CHARLES 
                   That was always the extraordinary
                   thing about her. Her weaknesses and
                   transgressions only seemed to make the
                   public love her MORE. Yet ours only
                   make them hate us. Why is that?

          CHARLES looks up..

                               CHARLES 
                   Why do they hate us so much?

          The QUEEN mutters under her breath...


                   Not `us', dear.


                           
                   What?

          The QUEEN salutes GAME-KEEPERS who remove their hats as the
          QUEEN roars past.









                   Yesterday, when we drove the coffin
                   back into London, there was a noise. A
                   bang. I don't mind telling you I
                   thought it was a gun.

          CHARLES's hands wring in anxiety..

                               CHARLES 
                   I thought someone had taken a shot at
                   me.

           he QUEEN hits the brakes, and pulls up. Visibly irritated by
          her son's weakness. She opens the door, and steps out..


                   Why don't you go on without me? I'm
                   going to walk back..


                   Are you sure?


                   Yes. It looks like rain..
                        
                   And I'm not in the mood for stalking
                   anyway.

          CHARLES knows better than to contradict his mother. He gets
          into the driving seat, puts on the safety belt, and drives
          off.

          The Land Rover disappears in a cloud of dust.

          The QUEEN straightens, then notices her shoe-laces are
          undone. The DOGS bark excitedly.


                   Wait! My shoe-lace is undone. You
                   don't want me to trip and hurt myself,
                   do you?
                         a beat)
                   You wouldn't get any proper walks
                   then.

          The QUEEN blissfully chatters away to the DOGS. So much
          easier than people...


                   Right. Done. Now who knows the way
                   home?

           he DOGS yap excitedly, immediately scamper off in the
          direction of the castle..


                   You clever things!










           HARLES's Land Rover drives up into the hills, into
          spectacular landscape. A mile or two ahead, above the tree-
          line, PHILIP, the two PRINCES and STALKERS carrying guns,
          crawl on their bellies in pursuit of their quarry..

          A hundred years ahead of them, the STAG, unaware of the
          danger, imperiously, grazes on the grass..






          The QUEEN, granite-faced, still smarting from her row with
          CHARLES, is in her bedroom. A nightcap martini is on her
          bedside table. She is writing her diary.

          PHILIP emerges from the bathroom, appears in the doorway..


                     I spoke to Charles this afternoon.

              flicker of coldness behind her eyes..


                     Who was good enough to share with me
                     his views on motherhood.


                     What did he say?

            TV plays in the corner. DIANA, starved thin, panda-eyes,
          the infamous Martin Bashir `PANORAMA' interview..


                     How wonderful Diana was.


                     That's changing his tune.


                     What a natural.


                     ..I think..they see me as a threat of
                     some kind..

          PRINCE PHILIP sees what's on television, then grimaces..


                          
                     Oh, for God's sake..








                   Maybe he's got a point. Maybe we are
                   partly to blame.

          PHILIP goes over to the television..


                   I can't watch this.


                   No, wait. Leave it.

          PHILIP stares at the screen..


                   "Every strong woman in history has had
                   to walk down a similar path.."


                   We encouraged the match. And signed
                   off on it. Both of us.
                         a beat)
                   You were very enthusiastic, remember.


                   She was a nice girl. Then.


                   "And I think it's this strength that
                   causes the confusion and the fear."

          PRINCE PHILIP shakes his head..


                   And I was sure he'd give the other one
                   up. Or, at least make sure his wife
                   towed the line.
                        
                   Isn't that what everyone does?

          A flicker behind the QUEEN's eyes.


                   Is it?

          Her knuckles momentarily whiten. Unaware, PHILIP stares at
          the television..


                   "Why is she strong? Where is she
                   getting it from? Where is she going to
                   take it? How is she going to use it?"

          He rolls his eyes in disbelief..






                               PRINCE PHILIP 
                   I can't bear it any more. If you're
                   watching, I'll sleep in here. Early
                   start tomorrow..
                        (kisses her on the
                         forehead)
                   See you in the morning.

          PHILIP goes, leaving the QUEEN staring. Still stinging from
          his remark about adultery.

           ZAP', she angrily hits the remote. The picture goes black.




          TONY BLAIR and CHERIE at home, watching television. It's 10
          o'clock. The KIDS are in bed, but their TOYS are still strewn
          around the sitting-room. TONY is tidying them up into boxes..

          ON SCREEN: British historian DAVID STARKEY is lambasting
          CHARLES. TONY and CHERIE sit on the sofa, watching
          television, eating pasta on their knees. STARKEY defends the
          QUEEN. Part of an older generation. She knows no better.

                   How much of all this could be the
                   first stirrings of..



                    hat?


                   ..I don't know...something more
                   interesting. Maybe this time people
                   have finally seen them for what they
                   are.


                   Which is?


                   A bunch of freeloading, emotionally
                   retarded...nutters.


                        
                   That's just absurd.


                   Why? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon
                   of privilege and wealth. They don't
                   pay tax.


                   Yes, they do.








                   The Queen alone costs us what? Thirty,
                   forty million a year..

          TONY reaches the door, and turns..


                    ot you, too. Look...if you want to
                   have a serious conversation about
                   this..


                   I do..


                   ..about the Constitution..


                    e don't HAVE one..


                   ...or about ways in which we as a
                   Government could begin to phase out
                   hereditary privileges, then fine.


                        
                   If you're going, take the dishes..

          TONY comes back to take the dirty plates..


                   But spare me the whole.."off with
                   their heads" thing.


                   Why?


                   Because it insults your intelligence.


                   "The case for reform is simple and
                   obvious. It is in principle wrong and
                   absurd that people should wield power
                   on the basis of birth, not merit or
                   election."
                        
                   YOUR words, not mine.

          TONY is momentarily thrown..


                   Well, maybe now I've grown up.
                         a beat)
                   It's unimaginable this country being a
                   republic. Certainly in her lifetime.








                   Why?


                   Because...no would would wear it.
                        (can't help laughing at
                         the idea)
                   No one WANTS it.
                        
                   It's just...daft.

          TONY heads for the door..


                   It's not a mother thing, is it?

          TONY turns..


                   Think about it. If she were still
                   alive, wouldn't Hazel be exactly the
                   same age? Whenever you talk about your
                   mother, you mention her stoicism. Her
                   frugality. Her sense of duty. The fact
                   she was brought up in the way. Well
                   c'mon..?
                        
                   Who does THAT sound like?

          TONY smiles.


                   I'm going to do the washing-up.          F





          ALASTAIR and TONY walk through the labyrinthine corridors and
          busy offices..


                   All right, the good news is that the
                   Palace has agreed to video screens in
                   the Royal Parks.


                   And the bad news?


                   Crash barriers.


                   What about them?









                    hey're now predicting more than two
                   million people will descend on London,
                   and there aren't enough barriers to
                   line the route. So we've gone cap in
                   hand to the French for theirs. And
                   there's something else I think you
                   should see.

          ALASTAIR leads TONY into..




           TONY follows ALASTAIR into an office where a television plays
          in the corner. Several young AIDES and INTERNS are watching,
          recording, making notes. Shirtsleeves, feet on desks.
          Informal.


                   Can we run that piece again? You're
                   going to love this.

          An INTERN puts in a video, hits the `play' button. ON SCREEN:
          several members of the public complain about the royals. TONY
          watches for a moment, then..


                   Look, I know all this..


                   There!

           ne member of the public complains about the flag..


                   Don't tell me. There isn't a flag
                   flying at half mast above Buckingham
                   Palace.

          TONY rolls his eyes to himself.


                   God. Will someone save these people
                   from themselves..
                         

                     ine. I'll call Balmoral...

           TONY turns away, walks towards the door.


                   `Planet Zog'?


                   Because as Prime Minister of this
                   country, I've really got nothing
                   better to do..








          TONY walks out..




          The ROYAL FAMILY is gathered for a bar-be-cue lunch. At a
          distance, the BOYS, are in the river, being taught fishing by
          a GHILLIE..

          PRINCE PHILIP stands by a barbecue, struggling to get the
          fire to light. The QUEEN MOTHER is in another corner..

            LAND ROVER pulls up. The QUEEN gets out with her dogs. She
          notices PHILIP's struggle with the bar-be-cue..


                   Those fire-lighters no good?
                         carrying tupperware
                         boxes)
                   I brought some stew just in case. I
                   think it's lamb. We could always have
                   that cold..


                   No, we'll be all right.

           he QUEEN throws some food to her dogs, but makes several
          hand gestures forbidding them to eat. The DOGS salivate, and
          whimper, but dutifully show their forbearance. Staring at the
          food.

          The QUEEN, meanwhile, starts setting places at the table with
          plates, knives and forks..


                   Robin had a call from the Prime
                   Minister. Who expressed his concern.

           HILIP turns, an exasperated look..


                   About WHAT?


                   The flag above Buckingham Palace. He
                   thinks it should be flying at half-
                   mast.

          The DOGS continue to P
                               whimper hungrily.


                   Then I hope Robin told him there ISN'T
                   a flag above Buckingham Palace...
                        (angrily jabs coals with a
                         long, sharp fork)
                   ...only the Royal Standard, which
                   flies for one reason only.






                               PRINCE PHILIP
                   To denote the presence of the Monarch.
                   Since you're here, the flag pole is
                   bare. Which is as it should be.

           HARLES clears his throat..


                   Isn't it possible..that to some
                   people...the Royal Standard is just..
                   ..a flag? And that the flap pole being
                   bare sends out the wrong signal.

          The QUEEN turns. A withering look..


                   That's not the point.


                   The point is it's more than four
                   hundred years old. It has never been
                   lowered for ANYONE..


                   Your grandfather didn't get that flag
                   at half-mast when he died and if your
                   mother were to die tomorrow, she
                   wouldn't get it either.


                   Yes...but sometimes...in a situation
                   like this..one has to be flexible..

          All heads turn. And stare at CHARLES.


                        
                   It is just a flag.


                   "What about the Union Jack?", was Mr.
                   Blair's next suggestion.


                        
                   Oh, for heaven's sake.


                   The next thing he'll be suggesting you
                   change your name to Hilda and mine to
                   Hector?

                          angry gesture)
                   Who does he think he's talking to?
                   You're the Sovereign. The Head of
                   State. You don't get dictated to.
                          a beat)
                   You've conceded the idea of a public
                   funeral. You've opened up the parks.
                   That's ENOUGH.







          The QUEEN indicates to PHILIP to keep his voice down, to
          avoid upsetting the BOYS, who are still fishing..

                               PRINCE PHILIP 
                   You wait. In forty-eight hours it was
                   all have calmed down.


                   Like those condolence books.


                   Quite right.
                        
                   When we started with one, everyone
                   predicted they would grow and grow.
                   But we've heard nothing more about
                   that, see?

          CHARLES clears his throat..


                   Apparently there are now fifteen.


                   What..?


                   And people are queuing through the
                   night.

          PHILIP stares. The QUEEN's expression changes.




          CHARLES crosses the saloon to his study, talking to his
          Private Secretary.


                   In one sense its comforting.

                   popularity.
                        
                   But they're still making the mistake
                   of thinking the Diana they knew from
                   living and dealing with her, will
                   eventually be the one seen by the
                   public. But it's not. The two Dianas,

                   the papers, would you? If my mother

          marked.."THE WINDSORS STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND US."

          JANVRIN's face looks haunted..

                               JANVRIN 
                   Well, I'll try not to take that
                   personally.




          TONY sits on his sofa. The three speech-writing AIDES
          stand/sit in front of him. TONY reads from the speech..


                   "People have been yearning for a
                   change in this country." Good. "The
                   result is a quiet revolution now
                   taking place. Led by the real
                   modernisers. The British People.."

           TONY tails off..


                   `Revolution'? Not you, too?
                         tails off)
                   Who wrote this?

          One AIDE puts up his hand.


                   Where does it come from?


                   Where does it come from?


                   Just look at the papers. Talk to
                   people on the streets.


                   Something's happening out there.

          TONY's expression changes. He gets to his feet. Walks out,
          muttering under his breath..







                   Revolution.

          The AIDES look at one another..




          TONY puts his head around his SECRETARY's door..

                               TONY 
                   Get me Balmoral, will you?
                         a beat)
                   I'll take it in my office.




          TONY walks back into his office. His face is deadly serious.


                   Right. You lot. Out.

          TONY stands by the door. Holding it open. The AIDES stare at
          one another..


                   What about the speech?


                   Later.

          The AIDES file out.




          The QUEEN and JANVRIN are working in one corner, going
          through her red boxes. In another corner, PRINCE PHILIP sits
          watching the television..

          A tea-tray sits in front of him. Scones. Tea-cakes.

           he QUEEN and JANVRIN are finishing off. JANVRIN stands,
          ..


                   ..and finally, Ma'am, a DSO medal. A
                   Corporal, in Kosovo..you may have read
                   about it in the papers..pulled two
                   civilians from a bus after a bomb
                   blast.

          The QUEEN signs the certificate of honour. PRINCE PHILIP
          calls out, indicating the tea..








                   Hurry up, dear. Getting cold.

                                 ELIZABETH 
                   Is that it?


                   Yes, Ma'am. Just the letter of
                   condolence to the widow of the
                   Ambassador to Brazil.

          The QUEEN signs. JANVRIN bows and leaves.


                   Good.

          The QUEEN walks over to join PRINCE PHILIP for tea by the
          television, when JANVRIN turns, (we notice his SECRETARY
          stands in the doorway)..


                   Ma'am, apparently the Prime Minister
                   is on the phone for you.


                        
                   Tell him to call back.

          The QUEEN hesitates, then..ever dutiful..


                   No, I'd better take it.

          PRINCE PHILIP rolls his eyes. JANVRIN nods to his SECRETARY,
          who rushes off to transfer the call.

           he QUEEN walks over to her desk again. Picks up the phone.


                   Prime Minister?




          TONY sits up on his sofa in his office..


                   Good afternoon, your Majesty. I'm
                   sorry to disturb. I was just
                   wondering..




          PRINCE PHILIP indicates she should put TONY on speaker-phone.
          The QUEEN obliges. TONY's voice comes out..







                   ...whether you'd seen any of today's
                   papers?

          The QUEEN looks at her desk. Most of the newspapers are
          strewn out in front of her..


                   We've managed to look at one or two,
                   yes.


                   In which case, my next question would
                   be - whether you felt some kind of
                   response might be necessary?

                               ELIZABETH 
                   No. I believe a few over-eager editors
                   are doing their best to sell
                   newspapers..and it would be a mistake
                   to dance to their tune.


                   Under normal circumstances I would
                   agree, but..P

                        
                   Here we go! The bloody flag again..!

          ELIZABETH indicates for PHILIP to be quiet..


                   ..my advisers have been taking the
                   temperature among people on the
                   streets - and the information I'm
                   getting is that the mood..
                        
                   ...is quite delicate.


                        
                   Of course. That's where all the ruddy
                   cameras are.

           ELIZABETH gestures again for PHILIP to `SSSsshhh'..


                   So what would you suggest, Prime
                   Minister? Some kind of statement?


                   No, Ma'am. I believe the moment for
                   statements has passed.

           TONY takes a deep breath..







                   I would suggest flying the flag at
                   half-mast above Buckingham Palace...

          PRINCE PHILIP almost has an apoplexy..


                   See!


                   And coming down to London at the
                   earliest opportunity.

          PHILIP stares in disbelief.."What?"


                   It would be a great comfort to your
                   people and would help them with their
                   grief.


                   THEIR grief?

           he QUEEN exchanges a look with PHILIP..


                   If you're suggesting that I drop
                   everything and come down to London
                   before I attend to two boys that have
                   just lost their mother..you're
                   mistaken.


                   Absurd..   E

                   I doubt there are many who know the
                   British more than I do, Mr. Blair, nor
                   who has greater faith in their wisdom
                   and judgement. And it is my belief
                   that they will soon reject this `mood'
                   which has been stirred up by the
                   press...in favour of a period of
                   restrained grief, and sober, private
                   mourning.
                         a beat)
                   That's the way we do things in this
                   country. Quietly. With dignity.
                        
                   It's what the rest of the world has
                   always admired us for.


                   Well, if that's your decision, Ma'am,
                   of course the government will support
                   it.





                               TONY
                        
                   Let's keep in touch.


                   Yes.
                            could hardly be less
                            enthusiastic)
                   Let's.

          The QUEEN hangs up. Looks over at PHILIP..


                   Bloody fool.

          He indicates the tea..


                   Now your tea's gone cold.




           TONY hangs up the phone. He is lost in thought. His SECRETARY
          sticks her head around the door..


                   Robin Janvrin on one.
                         a beat)
                   He must have been listening in.

          TONY picks up the phone.


                   Mr Janvrin?




          JANVRIN speaks on the telephone to TONY BLAIR.


                   Prime Minister, I understand how
                   `difficult' her behaviour must seem to
                   you..how `unhelpful'..but try to see
                   it from her perspective..
                        
                   She's been brought up to believe its
                   God's will that she is who she is.


                   I think we should leave God out of it.
                   It's just not helpful.


                   She won't have seen anything like this
                   since the Abdication.
                         a beat)





                               JANVRIN
                   And I cannot emphasise enough what
                   affect that had on her. Unexpectedly
                   becoming King as good as killed her
                   father.


                   All right - but first we have to deal
                   with these terrible headlines. I'll
                   see what I can do with the Press.


                   I'm most grateful, Prime Minister.


                   But I can't promise anything. It's not
                   me they want to see.

          TONY hangs up, thinks, then..




          Tony comes out of his office and walks down the corridor to
          where the secretaries are.


                   Ask Alistair to come and see me will
                   you.

          The Secretary nods and picks up the phone.


                    nd cancel whatever I'm doing tonight.

          He turns and goes back to his office.




          The QUEEN drives out in her Land Rover. And into the
          countryside..




          The Land Rover shakes and judders. The QUEEN bobs up and
          down. ESTATE WORKERS remove their hats as she drives past..




          The roads have become rougher and narrower. The QUEEN drives
          with surprising confidence and ability. The QUEEN reaches a
          fork. She drives on, taking the right fork.









          The QUEEN reaches the River Dee, then slows down. She stops
          and stares. Ahead of her is a difficult, quite perilous
          crossing.

           he QUEEN composes herself, visibly intimidated. A deep
          breath, then..

          She drives into the fast-moving river.




          The Land Rover's engine roars. The jeep rocks alarmingly side
          to side as it slowly crosses the river.

          One big rock after another. The QUEEN skilfully negotiates
          the challenge, and is beginning to enjoy the experience..

          But ahead is one rock she hasn't seen..

          `Crreeak', the Land Rover's undercarriage hits the rock. The
          ugly sound of tearing metal.

           he QUEEN instinctively brakes, then sensing that was the
          wrong thing to do, slams her foot down on the accelerator.
          The engine roars in protest, and..

          `Snap'. An ominous mechanical sound.


                   Oh..

          The QUEEN's eyes widen. Knowing that sound was serious.


                   Oh, you are stupid.

          She tries to start the car again, but to no avail. No matter
          what she does, the Land Rover is stuck..

          The QUEEN looks into the glove box. Inside is a mobile
          telephone.

           he QUEEN punches in a number..


                         
                   Hello? Could you put me through to the
                   Ghillies' office?
                          listens)

                     ello, Thomas? I'm afraid I've done
                   something very foolish. I think I've
                   broken the prop-shaft. Crossing the
                   river.










          The HEAD GHILLIE listens, his expression changes in alarm,
          then..


                   Are you sure, Ma'am?


                   Yes, perfectly. The front one, not the
                   rear. I've lost the four-wheel drive.
                   You forget I worked as a mechanic in
                   the war.


                   And are you all right?




          The Land Rover creaks as it rocks on the stone..


                   Yes, perfectly, thank you. I'm so
                   sorry to waste your time..


                   We'll come out straightaway.


                   Oh, will you? You are kind. Thank you.
                         a beat)
                   I'll wait by the car.

          The QUEEN hangs up. Puts the phone away, then opens the Land
          Rover's door.




          The QUEEN gingerly climbs out of the Land Rover, and walks
          across the stones to the river bank, getting her shoes wet.




          The QUEEN sits on a stone by the stranded Land Rover. She
          sits in silence..

           othing but the sound of running water, wind in the trees,
          and birdsong.

          Ah, that's good.

           he QUEEN closes her eyes. All around her, silence except for
          the sounds of the great outdoors.







          Privacy at last. The first moment of silence in what feels
          like months. The QUEEN breathes deeply. It's all been a bit
          much.

           o time to think.

           ne shock after another.

           veryone shouting.

           ll far too dramatic.

           ome to think of it, this is the first time she's been able
          to..

          Suddenly, almost imperceptibly, we notice her shoulders are
          shaking. Not dramatically, but enough to suggest what is
          happening. The QUEEN - away from the world - is crying.

           e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into her jacket
          pocket, produces a handkerchief, and dabs her eyes.
          Gradually, she composes herself.

          That's better.

           on't want to make a fuss.

           he GILLIES will be here soon.

          The QUEEN takes a deep breath. That's better.

           resently the sound of rustling leaves, and the unmistakable
          sense that she is being watched. Strange..

          The QUEEN turns to have a look, then almost drops the cup..

          Standing in front of her, no more than twenty yards, is the


          The QUEEN freezes, hardly dare breathe. It is enormous. His
          antlers are bigger and more dramatic than she could have
          imagined.

          His fur is thick. His blaze across his nose is distinctive.
          He is vast, almost the size of a horse.

           nd staring at her. The QUEEN stares back.


                   Oh, you are a beauty.

          It is unprecedented - almost supernatural. No STAG ever
          willingly comes this close to humans.

           he QUEEN looks into his dark, brown eyes. An unmistakable
          connection between them..






          It's a magical moment. All around them the whistling of wind,
          the sound of trees bending. Then, ever so faintly, in the
          distance..

          The hum of approaching engines. It's the GILLIES coming to
          look for the QUEEN. Sensing this..

                               ELIZABETH 
                        (indicating the STAG
                         should go)
                   Go. Go on. You'd better go..

          The STAG remains rooted to the spot..

                               ELIZABETH 
                        
                   Go. Shoo. Go on.

          The ENGINES get closer and closer. The STAG takes a last look
          at the QUEEN, then briefly inclines his head, turns, and
          walks off.

           o sooner has he disappeared into the woods, than..

          Several LAND ROVERS appear, driving across the river, and
          GILLIES and EQUERRYS jump out, holding tow-ropes, waving in
          greeting and calling out, concerned for the QUEEN's safety..

          The QUEEN takes a last look in the direction of the STAG, to
          make sure he has gone, and smiles to herself.

           e's vanished. It's as if he was never there.




          TONY is putting on a fresh shirt and tie, standing in front
          of a a mirror. CHERIE enters..


                   I've just been told there are news
                   crews outside waiting for you to come
                   and "speak to the people."


                   Yes.


                   What's that about?


                   I told the Queen's private secretary
                   I'd do what I could to help with the
                   press.







                   Why? Don't you think she deserves it?
                   Sitting up there on her 40,000 acres.


                   I know...but allowing her to hang
                   herself might not be in our best
                   interests either.

           TONY exits, then stops at the door..


                   Besides, I think there's
                   something...ugly about the way
                   everyone's started to bully her.

           HERIE watches TONY go.




           he QUEEN is in bed, watching television. Staring.

           N SCREEN: television footage of TONY BLAIR, shaking hands
          with `the people', defending the QUEEN, helping MOURNERS with
          their grief..


                   ..earlier tonight the Prime Minister
                   went out and pleaded with people to
                   understand the Royals' behaviour..

          PRINCE PHILIP appears in the doorway...


                   How are the boys?


                   Not so good tonight. A lot of slamming
                   doors.
                        
                   I think they saw the papers.

          The QUEEN's eyes close. Pained..


                   Oh, no..

          ON SCREEN: television footage of FAMILIES sleeping in parks.
          Kensington Palace is a sea of flowers and tributes. The MALL
          is lined with singing, hugging, weeping MOURNERS of all ages
          and nationalities, holding candles..


                   I'll take them out early again
                   tomorrow morning.






          The QUEEN stares with total lack of comprehension at the VOX
          POPS which the television interviewer is doing..


                   Where have you come from?


                   Hamburg.


                   Hamburg, Germany?


                   Well, I just had to be here. She was
                   such a wonderful woman..


                   What?


                   She was an angel..


                   ...and a hysteric.


                    o compassionate, and caring..


                   Oh, please..

          PHILIP indicates the television..

                               PRINCE PHILIP 
                   Sleeping in the streets and pulling
                   out their hair for someone they never
                   knew?

          He shoots a quizzical look..


                   And they think we're mad?

          PHILIP turns to the QUEEN..

                               PRINCE PHILIP 
                   Have you seen the latest funeral guest
                   list?


                   No.


                   I suggest you keep it that way. A
                   chorus line of soap stars and
                   homosexuals.
                        






                                 PRINCE PHILIP
                     Apparently Elton John is going to be
                     singing.

          The QUEEN's eyes close. It's agony.


                     That'll be a first for Westminster
                     Abbey.

          The QUEEN stares distractedly at the television..


                     Condolence books are now being signed
                     in our embassies in every major city
                     in the world.
                           a beat)
                     And in London alone the number has
                     reached forty.

           fter a beat..


                           stares at the CROWDS of
                           MOURNERS on the
                           television)
                     This reminds me of one of those films.
                     A few of us in a Fort. Hordes of Zulus
                     outside.


              silence. The TELEVISION coverage continues..


                     So it's VITAL you hold firm. Stick to
                     your guns. You wait. They will come to
                     their senses soon.
                           a beat)
                     They HAVE to.

          PHILIP climbs into bed beside the QUEEN..


                     C'mon, move over, Cabbage.

          The QUEEN stares at the TV. Staring at a modern Britain, a
          modern world she no longer understands.




          A bright, full moon. The unmistakable silhouette of THE STAG
          walks slowly across the blue-white orb - until he reaches a
          river..

          There, he stops, and bellows imperiously into the night.











          The following morning.

          6.30 am. TONY watches from his bed. The pastel-coloured set
          of `GOOD MORNING TV'. The hosts, a MAN and WOMAN in their
          forties, sit on a sofa. The MAN turns to the camera..


                   It's six o'clock. Time for a look at
                   the morning's newspapers. Jenny..

          WE CUT TO: a smiling woman in her thirties, who sits at a
          coffee table which is covered in newspapers..


                   Good morning. Well if you thought
                   yesterday's headlines for the Royals
                   couldn't get any worse - think again.




          The QUEEN sits in bed, reading the newspapers. Her expression
          is ashen. She stares at the headlines.

          From outside her window, the sound of bagpipes as the PIPER
          SERGEANT stoically plays in a heavy Scottish downpour..

          A distant rumble of thunder.




          8.00 TONY BLAIR is with ALASTAIR CAMPBELL and a team of AIDES
          are in a meeting room with the newspapers in front of them..


                        

                    he Sun - "Where is our Queen? Where
                   is her flag?"
                         takes another paper)
                   The Express, "Show us you care", with
                   a picture of a grumpy Queen.
                        
                   The Mail - "Let the Flag Fly at half-
                   mast", and inside, "The Queen should
                   be here to show her respects."

          ALASTAIR raises his eyebrow.


                   Blimey! But the flip-side is...
                   "Blair more popular than Churchill
                   shock."







          ALASTAIR expects TONY to be pleased, but instead he appears
          concerned..


                   Did any of them pick up on our
                   statement of support?


                   Just one.

          CAMPBELL shows BLAIR the front page of `THE GUARDIAN' where
          "BLAIR DEFENDS STOICAL ROYALS.." is a minor headline..

                                LASTAIR 
                   Statements of support don't sell
                   papers.

          TONY's expression changes. Frustrated. He thinks, then..


                   Right..

          TONY gets to his feet, and walks out. ALASTAIR watches




          The QUEEN walks out for her walk with her Corgis. She has her
          head-scarf and old raincoat on. DOGS barking excitedly..

          She is about to set off, when JANVRIN appears, breathlessly..


                   The Prime Minister for you, Ma'am.

          The QUEEN looks pained at the thought..


                   I'm afraid he's rather insisting.


                   All right. I'll take it here.
                         a beat)
                   In the kitchens.




          Frantic KITCHEN STAFF disperse in all directions as the QUEEN
          comes into the kitchen, DOGS barking..

          COOKS and MAIDS doff their caps, bowing in respect, then run
          into hiding, as the telephone extension rings..

          The QUEEN picks it up..









                      ood morning, Prime Minister.

          The QUEEN gestures to her DOGS. They promptly fall silent.




          TONY sits in his chair..


                     Good morning, Ma'am.

           TONY hesitates, then chooses his words carefully..

                                 TONY 
                     You've seen today's headlines?




          COOKS and FOOTMEN rush in a chair for the QUEEN, and bring a
          cup of tea. The QUEEN sits down..

          The DOGS duly follow suit. And sit.


                     Yes, I have.


                     Then I'm sure you'll agree. The
                     situation has become quite critical.

          TONY takes a breath. Knows this won't be easy.


                     Ma'am, a poll that's to be published
                     in tomorrow's paper suggests 70% of
                     people believe your actions have
                     damaged the monarchy and one in four
                     are now in favour of abolishing the
                     monarchy altogether.

           ilence.


                     As your Prime Minister, I believe it's
                     my constitutional responsibility to
                     ADVISE the following..

          TONY braces himself. Knows the impact his words will have..




          The QUEEN hangs up. She appears profoundly shaken. She turns
          to JANVRIN..








                   Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?




           he QUEEN walks up a staircase to her mother's quarters..




          The QUEEN walks along a corridor. She reaches a door. Knocks.
          Then, rather touchingly, calls out..


                   Mummy?




           he QUEEN sits on the unmade bed, as the QUEEN MOTHER
          finishes getting dressed, ..


                   One - lower the flag to half-mast
                   above Buckingham Palace and all other
                   Royal residences. Two - leave
                   Balmoral, and fly down to London at
                   the earliest opportunity. Three - pay
                   respects in person at Diana's coffin.
                   And four - make a statement via live
                   television to my people and the world.

          The QUEEN stares.

                                ELIZABETH 
                   Swift prosecution of these matters, he
                   felt, might, just might avert
                   disaster.




           he QUEEN and QUEEN MOTHER walk through the grounds: stout,
          resolute, waterproofs, rain. A glorious Scottish summer.
          Distant rumbles of thunder...


                    bviously you're going to have to talk
                   to the Lord Chamberlain about all
                   this.


                   I have.


                   And to Robert Fellowes.








                   To him too.


                   And..?

                               ELIZABETH 
                   It seems they both agree with him.

          A silence.


                   I see.

           he QUEEN stares. Then..


                   Something's happened. There's been a
                   change...a shift of values..

          The QUEEN looks up..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   When you no longer understand your
                   people, isn't it time to hand over to
                   the next generation?


                   Certainly not! Remember the oath you
                   took


                   "I declare that my whole life, whether
                   it be long or short, shall be devoted
                   to your service."


                   Your WHOLE life. That's a commitment
                   to God as well as your people.


                   But if my actions are damaging the
                   crown?


                   Damaging them? My dear, you are the
                   greatest asset this institution has.
                   One of the greatest it has EVER had.
                   The problem will come when you leave,
                   but that's not for you to worry about -
                   and certainly not today.

           he Queen rolls her eyes..


                   Mummy..







          Then drifts off, into her own thoughts


                   It's just no one seems to value
                   tradition or constancy any more.
                        
                   It's all about show. About wearing
                   your heart on your sleeve.


                   And you're not like that. Never have
                   been. No...you must show strength. Re-
                   assert your authority. You sit on the
                   most powerful throne in Europe. Head
                   of an unbroken line that goes back
                   more than a thousand years. How many
                   of your predecessors do you imagine
                   would have dropped everything and gone
                   down to London because people holding
                   candles wanted help with their grief?

          The QUEEN MOTHER's tirade continues, but the QUEEN is not
          listening. She knows she has a decision to make.


                   And as for Mr Blair and his Cheshire
                   Cat grin...




          The stalking Party is wrapping up after a day on the moors,
          some two dozen people, stalkers, members of the Royal Family,
          gamekeepers etc. load up the Land Rovers ready to return to
          Balmoral Castle.

            mobile phone rings. The Head Ghillie appears holding the
          phone.


                   Mr Janvrin for you sir.

          Prince Philip takes the phone... a little surprised.


                   Yes Robin....?

          Philip listens


                   What? It's madness! The whole thing!
                   Bloody madness!

          Thunderous, Philip hangs up.


                   It seems we are going back to London!







          PHILIP climbs angrily into the Land Rover, slamming the door.
          People's eyes widen.




          The QUEEN's face in close-up. CHARLES peers round the door..

          He stares. Then, after a beat...


                   I've just been told. You've decided to
                   go back to London.

           he QUEEN's face. Avoids eye contact.


                   I just want to say - I admire...
                        (strangled, trying to find
                         the right words)
                   I think it's the right decision.

          Silence. CHARLES stares..


                   Let's hope we haven't left it too
                   late.

          The QUEEN ignores him. CHARLES goes.




           n explosion of flashlights: the motor-winders and flashbulbs
          of the WORLD's MEDIA whir and pop through the gates of
          Balmoral Castle.

          It's an eerie, venal image. An unmistakable echo of DIANA's
          world, and her last moments in Paris.

          The QUEEN, CHARLES, PHILIP, and the two PRINCES try not to
          show their hostility, and gingerly inspect the flowers laid
          at the gates of Balmoral..

          The QUEEN's face is grim set. Lips pursed. Visibly uneasy
          with the CAMERAS audibly whirring all around her.

          CHARLES holds his son's hand, and tries to concentrate on the
          flowers and wreathes and tributes.

            RINCE WILLIAM stares at the CAMERAS. Hostile,
          uncomprehending looks. The beginning of a lifelong animosity.
          Suddenly..

           BANG' a passing motorbike's exhaust backfires. CHARLES jolts
          in shock, and flinches privately.







          Clearly, his fears have not lessened. He's expecting the
          bullet at any moment..




          In the kitchen: CHERIE is feeding the kids supper at the
          kitchen table. The cheery chaos of family life. Everyone
          talking at once. Laughter. Teasing.

          Through an open door, we can see TONY in the sitting-room
          working. Shirt-sleeves, tie loosened..




          TONY sits with his feet up, doing his boxes, signing papers,
          and half watching television at the same time.

          ON SCREEN: the QUEEN and the Royals doing their photo-call.
          The voice of the NEWS READER at Channel Four..


                   We are just getting some pictures now
                   from Balmoral. These are rather
                   historic shots. Clearly the Queen has
                   responded to criticism that the Royal
                   Family is not engaged..

           TONY looks up. Breathes a sigh of relief..


                        
                   Thank God for that.

          From the kitchen: CHERIE's voice..

                               CHERIE 
                   It's fish-fingers. Want any?


                   Be right there.

          TONY finishes signing the papers. Turns off the TV. Walks
          into the kitchen. We hear CHERIE's voice as the door closes..


                   I'm afraid they're a bit burned.






          The PIPER SERGEANT walks around the castle perimeter playing
          the bag-pipes.










          The Queen is being dressed in black by her DRESSERS. Her Face
          apparently inscrutable. But the difficulty of the situation
          is clear.




          The QUEEN comes downstairs to the first landing where bags
          are being brought out of the rooms by MAIDS and VALETS


                   Where are the boys? Have they already
                   left?


                   Yes. They left for London after
                   breakfast. With Charles.

           HILIP shakes his head..


                   It's not right, you know


                   Yes, but further discussion is no
                   longer helpful either.

          The QUEEN heads downstairs.   PHILIP follows...


                   Oh, well. I suppose it gives the
                   ghillies time to find a new stag for
                   the boys now theirs has been shot.


                   What?

          The QUEEN momentarily stiffens..


                   Haven't you heard? It wandered onto
                   one of the neighbouring estates where
                   it was shot by one of the commercial
                   guests.


                   Really..?

          The blood has drained from her face..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   Which estate?









          The QUEEN, pulling an old Barbour over her black dress,
          emerges into a courtyard where the royal cars are being
          loaded with bags for the trip.

          She climbs into a landrover, starts the engine.

          SECURITY MEN stare quizzically at one another, then leap into
          life and dash to their own cars to follow

          They drive out of the Balmoral Estate.




          TONY sits at his desk working on his speech. A knock on the
          door. ALASTAIR CAMPBELL enters..


                   Here's your box. There's some

                   important policy unit stuff on top.
                          a beat)
                   And you've seen the papers?


                        
                   I'm the Prime Minister. Of course I've
                   seen the papers.

          ALASTAIR indicates the newspapers laid out on the table..

          'The Times': `PALACE BENDS THE KNEE TO BLAIR"

          'The Sun': "QUEEN CAVES IN ON PALACE FLAG".

          `The Express': "DOWNING STREET STEPS IN TO SAVE QUEEN".

          `The Mirror': "A QUIET WORD FROM TONY BLAIR AND THE NATION



                        
                   "Your Maj? Come down to London." "Who
                   says so?" "Tony Blair."

           LASTAIR reaches the door - sees TONY. Then..


                   "Mr. Father of the Nation."

          ALASTAIR goes. TONY watches. Losing patience.









          The QUEEN's Land Rover, plus a protection vehicle, pulls up
          in a courtyard at Braemar Castle.

          The DRIVERS jump out. Go to open the doors for her..

          Working STALKERS and GHILLIES stop in their tracks, and
          double-take. Faces appear at windows. STABLE-HANDS, VISITORS
          and ESTATE STAFF stop and stare..

          We over hear whispers, `Bloody hell!' `It's her!'

          Presently, the HEAD GHILLIE appears in a doorway,
          deferentially straightening his hair, and clothes. He walks
          towards the QUEEN.


                   Morning, Ma'am. Is it his Lordship
                   you've come to see?

           e reaches into his pockets for his cell-phone..


                   No, no..please don't disturb him. I've
                   come on another matter. I hope you
                   don't mind..




          The QUEEN and HEAD GILLIE walk towards a circular cooling
          room. The HEAD GILLIE opens the door..




          A large cooling room, where the shot animals are washed,
          disembowelled and cut up.

          Hanging in the centre of the room, his innards removed, blood
          draining onto the floor, is the STAG. A GAMEKEEPER, in
          overalls, is working on the carcass, when the door opens, and
          the QUEEN walks in.

           he GAMEKEEPER straightens. Stops what he's doing..


                   There he is..

          The QUEEN gasps in shock. Notices the GAMEKEEPER was about to
          begin the process of severing the STAG's head. The HEAD
          GILLIE, mistaking her reaction for admiration, smiles..







                               HEAD GILLIE 
                   Yes, he's a beauty, isn't he? An
                   Imperial, Ma'am. Fourteen pointer.

           ut the QUEEN has not heard. She indicates a nasty wound..


                    e was wounded.


                   Yes. We got our guest in very close,
                   had him lined-up perfect, and still..
                         shrugs apologetically)
                   ..an investment banker, Ma'am. From
                   London.

          The QUEEN stretches her hand out, almost touches the wound..

                               HEAD GILLIE 
                   I'm afraid the stalkers had to follow
                   him for miles - to finish him off.


                         voice cracks)
                   Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.

          Unseen by others, the QUEEN's knuckles whiten..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   Please pass my congratulations to your
                   guest.


                   I will, Ma'am.

           he clears her throat, then goes..


                        
                   God bless you.

          The QUEEN goes. Dignified on the outside, but dying a
          thousand deaths underneath.






          The QUEEN's face. She staring out of the window, dying a
          thousand deaths inside, on her way to RAF NORTHOLT in London.
          She is aboard the private jet belonging to the Queen's
          Flight, sitting opposite her is the QUEEN MOTHER

           n the table in between them are all the morning's NEWSPAPERS
          with their humiliating headlines.






          A shadow passes across her. The sound of a clearing throat.
          The QUEEN looks up. It's ROBIN JANVRIN. She snaps out of it.


                   Yes, Robin..

          She puts on her glasses. Composure returns. Professional
          again.


                   I've done a draft of your television
                   address.


                   Thank you.

           ANVRIN puts it down. He notices all the NEWSPAPERS.

                                ELIZABETH 
                   Was there anything else?

          JANVRIN opens his mouth, wants to say something to comfort
          her..but realises it would be inappropriate.


                   No, Ma'am. Landing in fifteen minutes.




          The CAR carrying the QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP sweeps into the





          ALASTAIR sits at his desk. A TV plays the footage of the
          QUEEN's car driving through the MALL..

          A SECRETARY walks in..


                   I've got a copy of the Queen's speech.

          She passes it over to ALASTAIR..


                   Shall I give Tony a copy?


                   Let me have a look at it first.

          ALASTAIR starts reading it..










          The QUEEN and PHILIP stare out of the car. For the first
          time, they get an idea of the actual size and scale of the



                        
                   Good God..

          The QUEEN stares in fear and disbelief at the people lining
          the MALL. In places, the CROWDS are standing twenty deep.

           he FACES are reflected in the car windows. Are they hostile?
          Are they people she understands? Camera flashlights pop.




          ALASTAIR makes a change to the Queen's speech. We CLOSE on
          the text as he writes, inserting...

                         "..speaking as a Grandmother"..

          In the background, on TV: we see the QUEEN's car pulls up.
          The doors open, the QUEEN gets out..

          Unaware her words are being edited by her Government.





           he QUEEN steps out into the crowds..




          TONY and several AIDES are watching the televisions.

          ON SCREEN: the QUEEN and PHILIP are looking at bouquets laid
          at the gates of the palace, reading messages and
          inscriptions..

          Candles are burning. Incense sticks. There are pictures of
          DIANA, and mini-shrines. Poems have been written.

           TONY watches intently. Behind him, the door opens and
          ALASTAIR enters..


                   They sent a copy of the Queen's
                   speech.

          ALISTAIR holds it between finger and thumb..








                   You might want to scrape the frost off
                   it first.

          ALASTAIR passes it to TONY..


                   I made a couple of changes. So it
                   sounds like it comes from a human
                   being.

          ALASTAIR turns, walks towards the door..


                   Oh, and one bit of good news. The old
                   boot's FINALLY agreed to pay respects
                   at Diana's coffin.

          TONY spins round, eyes flashing in anger..


                   You know when you get it wrong, you
                   REALLY get it wrong.
                         a beat)
                   That woman has given her whole life in
                   service to her people - fifty years
                   doing a job she NEVER wanted - a job
                   she watched kill her father. She's
                   executed it with dignity, honour and,
                   as far as I can tell, without a single
                   blemish - and now we line up baying
                   for her blood - why? Because she's
                   struggling to lead the world in
                   mourning for a woman who threw
                   everything she offered back in her
                   face, and who seemed, in the last few
                   years, to be committed twenty-four
                   seven to destroy everything she holds
                   dear.

           TONY storms off.




          The QUEEN continues to read the hand-written messages for
          DIANA, "We love you." "Rest with the angels, Diana". "You
          touched us with your love."

           nd also some which are downright hostile. "You were too good
          for them." "They have your blood on their hands."

           he QUEEN stares, visibly shocked, then..

          Behind her, a small GIRL approaches, holding a bouquet of
          flowers. She stops, in front of the QUEEN..








                   Oh..hello.

           he LITTLE GIRL tries to curtsey..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   Would you like me to place them for
                   you?


                   No.


                   Oh.


                   They're for you.


                        
                   For me..?

          The QUEEN is thrown. Suddenly looks utterly lost. Vulnerable,
          almost childlike. Her eyes are puffy and swollen, as though
          she is fighting tears..

           ROWDS of MOURNERS watch intently. The QUEEN takes the
          flowers, then turns and walks away, visibly shaken..




          A television CREW is rigging lights in the Chinese Room in
          Buckingham Palace. JANVRIN enters and crosses the room.
          CAMERAS are being fixed to tripods..

          The QUEEN sits in a corner going through her speech.


                   Your Majesty, there's a last minute
                   addition from Downing Street. They're
                   suggesting adding `..and as a
                   grandmother..' here.


                   Right.

          The QUEEN makes a note on the text..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   "So what I say to you now, as your
                   Queen and as a grandmother, I say from
                   my heart."


                   You think you can say it?








                   Do I have a choice?

          The QUEEN turns as SOUND RECORDERS fix a clip-mike to her
          dress.


                   We're ready for you, your Majesty..

          The QUEEN gets up.


                   Just to confirm this is going out
                   live.


                   Right


                   And you'll be at the front of the six
                   o'clock news on all the channels


                   I see.

          The QUEEN is led over to where the DIRECTOR has placed a
          chair and table in front of the cameras and lights..


                        
                   Ten seconds, everyone..

          The QUEEN sits at her desk. Final touches from hair and make-
          up. The MALL is clearly visible. The QUEEN holds the speech
          in front of her..

                               DIRECTOR 
                   Five, four..

          We close on the QUEEN's face, and..


                   Since last Saturday's dreadful news we
                   have seen, throughout Britain and the
                   world, an overwhelming expression of
                   sadness at Diana's death..



          PRINCE PHILIP and PRINCE CHARLES watch. PHILIP clenches his
          jaw muscles in irritation.




           he QUEEN continues..






                   We have all been trying in our
                   different ways to cope. The initial
                   shock is often succeeded by a mixture
                   of other feelings. Disbelief,
                   incomprehension, anger and concern for
                   those who remain.




          TONY and CHERIE BLAIR watch from their apartment..


                   We have all felt these emotions in
                   these last few days. So what I say to
                   you now, as your Queen and as a
                   grandmother, I say from my heart...

          TONY flinches in sympathy as she says the line. CHERIE
          notices this, then..


                   "Heart"? What "heart". She doesn't
                   mean a word of this.


                   That's not the point. What she's doing
                   is extraordinary.
                        
                   That's how you survive.

          CHERIE turns, and stares..


                   Listen to you! A week ago you were the
                   great moderniser, making speeches
                   about the "People's Princess", now
                   you've gone weak at the knees.

          TONY bristles with irritation..


                   I don't know why I'm surprised. In the
                   end, all Labour Prime Ministers go ga-
                   ga for her Maj.


                   I hope that tomorrow we can all,
                   wherever we are, join in expressing
                   our grief at Diana's loss, and
                   gratitude for her all-too-short life.









          The QUEEN draws to a close. Her face is inscrutable. The
          DIRECTOR prepares his CREW to wind up..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   May those who died rest in peace and
                   may we, each and every one of us..



                               ELIZABETH 
                   ..thank God for someone who made many,
                   many people happy.

          The QUEEN holds her expression for the camera. Then..


                        
                   And we're out..!

          The QUEEN's face relaxes. As does everyone in the room. A
          huge, collective breathing out.

                                IRECTOR 
                   Thank you, your Majesty.

          But the QUEEN doesn't acknowledge him. She removes her clip-
          mike, and hands it to the DIRECTOR..

          ..then walks over to a waiting PRINCE PHILIP, who
          protectively extends an arm. The QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP
          leave the room. People are left staring awkwardly at one
          another..

          OVER THIS: we FADE IN the sound of a haunting, elegiac hymn..




          A soloist sings "Libera me, Domine" from Verdi's Requiem, in
          Westminster Abbey as:

          GUESTS, (including TOM CRUISE, TON HANKS, NICOLE KIDMAN and
          STEVEN SPIELBERG), arrive with swollen, red eyes, for the
          funeral.

           UCIANO PAVAROTTI also attends - along with STING, TRUDI
          STYLER, BILL and HILARY CLINTON, ELTON JOHN, MOHAMMED AL-


           TONY and CHERIE BLAIR take their positions at the front of
          the church. The First Couple of Great Britain.









          DIANA's coffin is driven away. Showered by flowers all the
          way to her final resting place at Althorp.

           he entire distraught, tearful NATION it seems, has come out
          onto the streets to pay their final respects.









          The face of TONY BLAIR stares back from a bathroom mirror.
          CHERIE is proudly tying his tie. Checking his appearance.

          We're in the family apartment above 11, Downing Street.
          CHERIE puts the finishing touches to his appearance..

          We notice her appearance has become even more stylish. Gone
          is her spiky hair. And the rough edges. Every inch the First
          Lady. They've both come a long way in a short time.


                   So? Off to see your girlfriend?


                   Now, now..


                   I hope she shows you some respect this
                   time. It's quite a debt of gratitude
                   she owes you.

          CHERIE straightens his tie..


                   Mr "Saviour of the Monarchy."


                       doubt she'll see it that way.




          TONY's motorcade sweeps into Buckingham Palace. Doors are
          opened by his PROTECTION OFFICERS.

           TONY steps out to be greeted by the waiting JANVRIN..


                   Robin. Good to see you.







                     Prime Minister.


                          
                     Tony, please..

          JANVRIN allows himself a private smile..




          TONY BLAIR and the EQUERRY walk along the corridor, and reach
          the door.

           TONY shoots his cuffs. Clears his throat. The EQUERRY knocks.




          TONY and the EQUERRY enter. Both bow from the neck..


                     The Prime Minister, Ma'am.

          TONY walks forward and meets the QUEEN, who, like JANVRIN,
          barely smiles, doesn't make eye contact, shakes his hand, and
          indicates a seat..


                     Do sit down.


                     Thank you.

           TONY sits, and stares at the QUEEN. Her face is inscrutable.


                     It's good to see you again. After
                     quite a summer..

          The QUEEN's face. Stiffens.

                                 TONY 
                     I'm referring to your visit to India
                     and Pakistan, where your comments
                     about ending historic disagreements
                     went down very well.

           ilence.

                                 TONY 
                     And the Commonwealth Heads of
                     Government Meeting. I spoke to the
                     Prime Minister of Malawi, who was
                     saying how much he appreciated your
                     tough stance on Nigeria.







          Silence.


                      I meant to tell you at the time but
                      you were being monopolised rather.

           ilence.


                      I imagine those occasions are quite
                      difficult. Twenty-four heads of
                      Government each clamouring for a
                      private audience..

          Silence. TONY takes a deep breath, then..


                      Also, we haven't had a chance to speak
                      since THAT week. And I wanted to offer
                      my apologies..

          The QUEEN looks up..


                      Whatever for?


                      In case you'd felt `manhandled' or
                      `managed' in any way.


                      Not at all.

              beat.


                      I don't think I shall ever understand
                      what happened this summer.


                      The circumstances were exceptional,
                      Ma'am. And in the end, you showed
                      great personal strength, courage, and
                      humility.   E

                       ou're confusing humility with
                      humiliation.


                      That's not true.


                      You didn't hear what they were saying
                      in the Mall that Friday.








                        I still believe History will show it
                        was a good week for you.


                        And an even better one for you, Mr
                        Blair.


                        But there are fifty-two weeks in a
                        year, Ma'am. And two and a half
                        thousand in a half century.

          The QUEEN looks up. Thrown by his compliment..


                        And when people come to assess your
                        legacy, no one will remember those few
                        days.


                        Really?




                        You don't feel that what respect or
                        affection people might once have had
                        for..

          She wants to say `Me', but instead says..


                        ..this institution has been
                        diminished?


                        Not at all.

              pause..


                        I gather some of your closest advisors
                        were less fulsome in their support..


                        One or two. But as a leader one
                        has...a different perspective.
                              a beat)
                        I could never have added my voice to
                        the chorus.


                        You're very kind.

          The QUEEN looks at TONY, raises an eyebrow..








                   But let's also not forget the more
                   pragmatic reason.


                   Which is?


                   That without me there to distract
                   everyone, it'd suddenly become
                   embarrassingly clear how much
                   unchecked power the British Prime
                   Minister actually has.

           TONY looks up..


                   If fifty years of doing MY job has
                   taught me anything, it is that the
                   people doing YOURS generally prefer me
                   with all my faults to some kind of
                   meddling President..
                        
                   Just look at the French.

          The QUEEN opens her handbag, and takes out her reading
          glasses..            E
                                ELIZABETH 
                   I suppose we'd better get on with the
                   business in hand..

          The QUEEN looks out of the window. Notices how the sun is
          setting..

                               ELIZABETH 
                   I do love this time of day. Shall we
                   walk while there's still some sunshine
                   left? I do hope you're a walker.


                   I am.


                   Good. The clocks go back next week,
                   then it'll be dark by five.

          TONY and the QUEEN get to their feet.

                                ELIZABETH 
                   I always think these meetings stand a
                   better chance of succeeding if the
                   Prime Minister is a walker.

          FOOTMEN open the door as TONY and the QUEEN go out of the
          Audience Room, and into..








          BLAIR and the QUEEN turns a corner, and emerge into a
          corridor from the audience room...


                   As a matter of fact, it's how I think
                   best. On my feet. I've never been one
                   for sitting around endlessly. A good
                   walk and fresh air sorts everything
                   out..

          Unexpectedly, she stops. And suddenly we realize she's been
          holding something back..


                   One in four, you said? Wanted to get
                   rid of me? T


                   For about half an hour. But then you
                   came down to London and all that went
                   away.



                   I've never been hated like that
                   before.


                   No. And that must have been difficult.


                   It was. Very.

          They begin walking again..


                   Ever since Diana people want glamour
                   and tears..the grand performance..and
                   I'm not very good at that. I prefer to
                   keep my feelings to myself. Foolishly
                   I believed that's what people wanted
                   from their Queen. Not to make a fuss
                   nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve,
                   duty first... self second.

          The QUEEN stops..


                   It's how I was brought up. It's all
                   I've ever known


                   One forgets. You were so young when
                   you became Queen.






          The QUEEN drifts off..


                   I was. A girl.

          Then pulls herself back..


                   But I can see the world has changed.
                   And one must 'modernise'.


                   Well, perhaps that's where I can help.


                   
                   Don't get ahead of yourself Prime-
                   minister, I think you'll find that I'm
                   supposed to be advising YOU!




          The corridor outside. As the QUEEN passes JANVRIN, he
          surreptitiously looks at his watch, and raises his eyebrow.
          The QUEEN smiles..




          FOOTMEN open double-doors which lead out into the gardens.
          The QUEEN and the PRIME MINISTER walk out..


                   So...what might we expect in your
                   first Parliament?

          TONY clears his throat, then..


                   Well, Ma'am, top of the list is
                   education reform. We want to radically
                   reduce classroom sizes...

          Our CAMERA slowly pulls back over the gardens, until the
          QUEEN and TONY are two dots in the distance...

          Time has moved on. Sand has covered the footprints.

          The momentary hiccup that was `Diana' already long
          forgotten..
