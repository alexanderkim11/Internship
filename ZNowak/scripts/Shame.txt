    BRANDON SULLIVAN [early 30's] lies staring up caught in a
    disarray of sheets until-

    The PEEP PEEP PEEP of an alarm clock, from deep within a
    distant apartment.

    The MUFFLED PAD of FOOTSTEPS crossing overhead-

    BRANDON listens then gets up, pulls blinds and heads out
    towards the bathroom-

    The SOUND of his feet disappearing down a distant corridor.

    The MURMUR of an answer phone as we hear BRANDON peeing, in a
    far off bathroom.




    BRANDON stands, looking down, watching until-

    A SUDDEN breeze, the subway train oncoming-

    BRANDON boards.

    The doors GLIDE SHUT-

    BRANDON just visible through the window of the train, walking
    towards a distant seat.




    BRANDON   sits, eyes casually tracing over the faces in the
    crowded   train. A HOMELESS MAN sits, further along the car,
    haggard   and grey, and sleeping, the seat empty, either side
    of him.   He looks more like a pile of clothes.

    BRANDON turns back. The reflection of an PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL
    caught in the glass opposite.




    BRANDON padding naked along a corridor. He flicks on an
    answer machine in passing-


                Hey...It's me?...Pick Up.. Pick
                Up...

    He enters the bathroom.





    We hear BRANDON peeing in the bathroom.




    The answer machine message drowned by the flushing of the
    toilet, the shutting of the door and the shower being
    switched on.




    A HOMELESS MAN head lolling, sat alone at the end of a busy
    car.

    BRANDON considers, catching the eye of-

    A PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL seated opposite, the whisper of a smile,
    grazing her lips.

    BRANDON's eyes teasing over-

    The fall of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's hair-

    The dip in her collarbone-

    Her nail polish with French manicure-

    BRANDON looks at her. She looks away.

    BRANDON resumes staring. She looks back through the bodies
    of commuters. We see their eyes looking at each other.
    Their seduction continues through the collage of colors and
    bodies.




    BRANDON, sits in a packed meeting room, a pitch just audible,
    DAVID FISHER, [early/ late 40's] BRANDON's boss, a kind of
    white noise, and yet-


              I find you disgusting..I find you
              inconsolable..I find you invasive..

    The IT TECHNICIAN just visible wheeling a cart away, with
    BRANDON's computer.


              That is what the cynics used to
              say..Companies would refuse to look
              to the future..They'd say `Can we
              stop this virus"?

    The scratch of a pencil against paper-



    BRANDON sits distracted, facing COLLEAGUE #1. MARIANNE
    [mid/late 20's] seated further along the table, steals a look
    at BRANDON.

    A glass door opens-

    The PRETTY ASSISTANT brings in coffee, sliding down a cup in
    front of BRANDON.


              As if it was a negative
              progression, a descent into hell,
              moving with stealth amongst those
              you need to affect, growing more
              and more with a momentum that is
              unstoppable.

    BRANDON looks across the hall, distracted by the IT
    TECHNICIAN who is replacing the computer in his office.


              Now, some inane kid snorting the
              entire load of his mother's spice
              cupboard and posts that on You
              Tube. They would watch as it would
              become the buzzword amongst high
              school kids everywhere.
              Eventually..their cynicism would
              turn to awe.





    BRANDON to the front door and opens it to reveal an



              Hi.


              Hi.



              Come in.

    BRANDON steps aside to let the ATTRACTIVE WOMAN in. She walks
    into the apartment as he closes the door.


              Drink?



              No thank you.



     BRANDON picks up money from the table and give it to ALEXA.
     She counts it and nods to BRANDON.


               Perfect.

     ALEXA puts the money in her bag.


               This Way.

     BRANDON gestures to his room. ALEXA turns and walks away.
     BRANDON follows.





     A tidy bedroom-

     BRANDON lies on the bed watching, waiting. ALEXA starts to
     take her top off.


               Slowly.

     ALEXA continues slowly, tosses it aside, and continues taking
     off her bra and panties. Finally putting her earrings on the
     bedside table. BRANDON reaches up to pull her onto the bed.




     The SOUND of BRANDON getting up-

     The SOUND of blinds being raised-

     CLOSE UP of a discarded earring on the carpet.

     BRANDON padding naked along a corridor.

     The SHARP TONE of the answer machine flicked on in passing-

     Audible from the corridor-


               Hey, it's me..

     We hear BRANDON turn on the shower.



               Pick Up.. Pick Up...

     BRANDON walks towards the kitchen and we hear him pour a
     glass of water.





                 Brandon?

     BRANDON crosses the hall and enters the toilet.



                 Brandon?

     BRANDON turns on the light, puts down his glass and urinates.



                  Brandon Where are you?-
                 Brandon? Brandon? 
                 Brandon... Urghhh!

     BRANDON finishes, flushes toilet, steps off screen



                 This is me Calling you.. 
                 Fuck!



     The CALLER hangs up

     BRANDON re-appears and closes the bathroom door




     BRANDON in the shower, a sense of movement, his hand, barely
     visible, moving back and forth.

     The fall of the shower-

     BRANDON stands, letting the water wash over him.




     BRANDON sits, looking over at the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL sitting
     opposite-

     The train moves on, after a while stopping at another
     platform.

     PEOPLE get on, PEOPLE get off.

     BRANDON's eyes travel down over the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's legs
     and up-

     She opens them a little, the dip of her skirt, sinking deep
     between her thighs-



     She looks up, senses BRANDON watching. She lets her fingers
     fall in her lap.

     BRANDON shifts a little in his seat to get a better look
     through the crowd. Suddenly she stands and makes her way to
     the train door. Hand reaching out and clenching a metal pole
     for stability, revealing a wedding ring.

     BRANDON's hand reaches for the pole too, touching her as he
     stands behind her. There is a gentle unison contact.
     BRANDON's breath, heavy on her neck. Both are frozen to the
     spot, caught in a mutual moment.




     The train door bolts open and the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL
     disembarks. BRANDON is blocked by a MALE PASSENGER as he gets
     out in quick pursuit of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL.

     BRANDON is several paces behind now, pursues. She turns left
     into a stairwell.

     It's almost like fighting a downward river. People are
     walking into his path as he struggles to keep pace with the


     The tail of her coat vanishes at the top of the stairs. A
     moment later, BRANDON reaches the summit, to be greeted by a
     wrought-iron gate.

     He looks left at one staircase. People ascend.

     He looks right at another staircase. Other passengers ascend.

     People come in and out of the turnstiles on the right-hand
     side. He has lost her. A sudden moment of disappointment
     crosses his face.

     He descends the staircase, dejected.




     BRANDON walks into his office and to his desk, stops in his
     tracks, heart thumping-

     A bare space where BRANDON's computer once was and next to it
     a replacement computer. A pink fluffy gonk or the like stuck
     to the screen.




     BRANDON walks into a toilet cubicle, shuts and locks the
     door. He cleans the seat with toilet paper, flushes, stands,
     and starts to masturbate.





     A TAP on the door-

     BRANDON enters DAVID's office, DAVID is lost in paperwork,
     looking up from his desk.


               Do you know what's going on with my
               computer?


               They took it.


               Yeah, I know. Someone could have
               told me.


               Some kind of Virus.


               Cool.


               I walk in and it's not there? And I
               get some kind of replacement?


               Some kind of virus. They're
               stripping it all out.

     BRANDON nods, swigs a Red Bull in his hands-


               Cool.

     BRANDON exits.




     BRANDON is walking with shopping bags. He slows by the
     revolving doors, spots a mother with buggy about to come out
     of the other door and hurries over to open the door for her.

     WOMAN comes out nodding her thanks.




     BRANDON looks through his vast record collection and
     carefully puts a disk on the record player.





     The chink of beer bottles, banging up against one another as
     BRANDON opens the fridge door-

     BRANDON peers in, considering the left over take out resting
     on the shelf. He takes it out, flipping open a bottle of beer
     in a familiar move and banging the door shut with his back.

     A flyer for an fancy take out flaps under a magnet on the
     fridge door.




     A comfortable apartment-

     BRANDON spoons Chinese take out into his mouth, sliding down
     in front a laptop resting on his desk.

     Music continues to surround the apartment.

     The bright serenade of his laptop opening, BRANDON resumes,
     fingers absently tapping the keyboard-

     A distant whir of a car alarm, far off.




     BRANDON, in the dark, watching pornography on his laptop-

     BRANDON's cell phone rings. He ignores it.

     And then steady monotonous ring of a telephone close by,
     BRANDON barely wavers as it clicks onto answer machine-

     The HEAVY DEAD TONE of the answer machine as the caller's
     message kicks in-


               OK......Me..again...I'm dying..I
               have cancer...I have one week to
               live..

     BRANDON smiles-



               It's the very worse kind of cancer.
               Of the vulva-

     BRANDON switches off the answer machine. Sighs, and returns
     to his laptop.


               




               




     A beautiful day-

     BRANDON's face now fresh, passing-

     A CUTE NEIGHBOR heading into the building, lost in
     conversation on her cellphone-


                      
               Hey.


                      
               Hey.

     BRANDON juggling cellphone, keys and satchel, heading off to
     work, watching the sway of her ass.




     MARIANNE is on the phone in a busy office




     Profile of MARIANNE's bare back.




     BRANDON, seemingly in a trance, looking out across the
     office, eyes fixed on MARIANNE in her glass cubicle, unaware
     of BRANDON staring.

     STEVEN's reflection in the window, we see him screw up a
     piece of paper and throw it at BRANDON.

     BRANDON shakes his head.


               You're such a dick


               What are you doing, man?

     BRANDON once again looks up toward MARIANNE.





     MARIANNE on the phone.

     DAVID now appears in front of BRANDON. From afar, nods to
     him, and greets a group of CLIENTS.


                Alright, gentlemen, If
               you'll just please make yourselves
               at home.


               Thank you.




     Just visible, in the conference room-

     BRANDON inside with the CLIENTS and DAVID. A sense of
     camaraderie. The meeting at an end. DAVID, slapping BRANDON
     on the back, the sense of celebration.


               It falls upon me, as your beloved
               boss, to propose a toast. To
               Success.




     The thump of music-

     BRANDON, DAVID and OTHERS wedged in a leather booth, several
     shots and beer down, the table littered with beers. Cheers.
     Male camaraderie.


               I hope my wife appreciates it.

     ALL chink glasses


               Get a new tie, please.


               


               Oh my goodness.  I love
               women in suits. I love women in
               suits.


     ALL Look off-screen at the women.




               We could talk business, I would
               rearrange my life.. Wow, she's
               beautiful.


               Grey suit?


               I'm gonna go talk to her.


               You should go talk to her.


               OK...OK..Count me down...


               Yeah you should

     BRANDON fist bumps with DAVID





               Boom.


               Have fun.


               Twenty bucks says he fucks it up.

     BRANDON starts to stand.





               Ash is amazing


               How's it humping an old man?


               Well, usually I do him on scotch.

     DAVID walks up to the bar behind the women.


               Incoming


               Hi, excuse me.




          Listen, I don't want to beat around
          the bush. I think you're absolutely
          gorgeous.


          Hi.


          My name's David.


          Hi David.

DAVID shakes hands with ELIZABETH


          Elizabeth


          Elizabeth


          Nice to meet you


          It's a beautiful name. 
          Hi, I'm David. I don't mean to be
          rude.

DAVID shakes hands with LOREN and RACHEL


          Loren.


          Hi, how are you?  David.


          Rachel.


          Nice to meet you, nice to meet you.
           Listen, can I buy
          you a drink?  Can I buy you
          all drinks?


          Sure, why not.


          I would love that. That would be my
          pleasure. What are you guys
          drinking? What do you want?


          Well, we were thinking shots.




          You were thinking shots?


          Sure.


          We just did shots of tequila. Would
          you guys like a shot of tequila?


          Bring it on.


          Love it. Love it.


          Excuse me, hey, bartender.
          Bartender? Can we get four shots of
          your finest tequila? Thank you very
          much.


          Hmm.

ELIZABETH sips her drink.


          I can see you're very successful.
          Yeah, I think part of the secret to
          my success is, is attention to
          detail and..


          Oh.


          Detail?


          Yeah.


          Play the game.

ELIZABETH closes her eyes


          What game?

ELIZABETH turns to DAVID


          Ok, er.. Blue or green?

The SUITED WOMAN closes her eyes, the flutter of her lashes
oddly fragile, in waiting until-




          I like games, I like this game.
          Blue..
              
          Green. Green, it's green.

They spring open to reveal brown eyes-

DAVID hesitates, throws his arms up, resigned.


          That's Brown. That's.. I don't know
          how you change the colour of your
          eyes like that. How do you do that
          so quickly?


          Wow. Wow.


          That's amazing. That's a real
          talent.


          Yeah, detail man. Detail man.

BRANDON slides down next to DAVID, back from the washroom.


          Hey buddy, hey buddy. Hey.


DAVID puts an arm around BRANDON.


          This guy, right here, fucking
          nailed it today.  I
          want you to know, you fucking
          nailed it. You're the man. Your
          pitch?  Amazing.
          Amazing.  Listen, we're
          playing a game here. 
          Close your eyes again.




ELIZABETH closes her eyes.


          Blue or green?


          Brown..

The SUITED WOMAN flicks open her eyes, smiles.




          Fuck Off.  Alright you.
          Hey, Loren. Loren. Close your eyes.

DAVID turns to BRANDON


          Blue.


          Blue.


          That's... you're just making that
          up.


          See. He's good.


          He's just.. He's just picking
          colors randomly.


          You can have his shot.

ELIZABETH passes BRANDON a shot.


          You know what? Excuse me. We need
          another shot, please.








          You can put these on me.


          No, no, no. I told you that... I
          had it.


          Thank you.


          No, I have it.


          Ill get the next round.


          Sure.




          You're a strong, independent woman.
          I like that, I like that.


          Thank you. Cheers

ELIZABETH raises her glass.


          Listen, cheers.

The others all raise their glasses


          Cheers


          To nailing it, and-


          To nailing it.


          To nailing it.


          Success. Yes. Cheers.

ALL down their shots


           Oh,
          Fuck.


          


           Whoah.


          So what do you girls do for fun?


          Fun? Er, karate.

DAVID mimics karate moves


          


          You hear this song. I love this
          song, I wrote this song...

DAVID holds out his hand to ELIZABETH




               And I would love it if you would
               dance with me to this son that I
               wrote for you.


               Erm..

     DAVID takes ELIZABETH's hand.


               Come on.

     DAVID tugs her arm playfully


               Come on, come on, come on. Let's go
               on the dance floor. One song.


               Oh..


               Yeah. Come on. You're a fun girl.
               It'll be fun. Come on.

     DAVID pulls ELIZABETH onto the dance floor.


               I'll bring her back. Swear to God.


               Fine.

     BRANDON turns to watch them on the dance floor.


               Come one, come on, it's fun. It's
               fun.




     The pulsing thump of music, the latest cutting edge sounds-

     DAVID pulls ELIZABETH into dancing, at first playful and
     funny.

     DAVID is insistent, pulling her closer, drawing her into a
     frenzied awkward dance. BRANDON looking on, the SUITED
     WOMAN's eyes grazing his, lingering on BRANDON as DAVID
     stumbles.


               There you go. Mwah! You're
               beautiful. Alright, alright,
               spinning, spinning, spinning. Wooh!



     BRANDON watches the duo dancing


               I'm grabbing her purse `cos she's
               gonna get robbed and roofied.


               

     RACHEL and LOREN walk off to the dance floor


               Dance?


               No.


               Are you sure?


               I'm sure.




     ELIZABETH and DAVID are amongst the dancers on the floor.
     DAVID is performing enthusiastically. ELIZABETH, slow,
     glances at BRANDON.

     We see BRANDON through the dancers, watching.




     DAVID struggling to push his arm through the twisted sleeve
     of his jacket, pursuing ELIZABETH and her friends up the
     street.


               Ok, ok, ok, ok, ok, ok. Hold on,
               hold on. No, listen. I just got to
               talk to you one more time, one more
               time. Listen..

     BRANDON comes out of the club, doing up his coat. Looks away
     at DAVID haranguing the trio.


               Your eyes, they're beautiful. You
               know why I didn't get it right the
               first time? Because it's, it's like
               a collage. Let me see your hand,
               let me see your hand..

     DAVID smiles, gently coaxing her in the opposite direction-

     BRANDON hails a cab. DAVID continues haranguing ELIZABETH




               Look at those eyes, look at those
               eyes. I know the color of your
               eyes.


               David, come on.


               Come on, we can play that game.
               That's so much fun when you play
               that game.


               Bye.

     A cab pulls up.


               It's okay. `cos I'm going this way.

     BRANDON opens the cab door and waits with the taxi. DAVID
     walks towards BRANDON.


               Hey man, he's going uptown.

     DAVID concedes throwing his arms up, jacket half on. DAVID
     paws BRANDON affectionately, straightens BRANDON's jacket,
     gives him a kiss and stumbles into the cab.


                Ok.


               I'll see you tomorrow

     The cab pulls away.




     A car glides close to the kerb-

     BRANDON head down walking-


               Hey. Wanna ride?

     BRANDON smiles-


               Sure.

     BRANDON gets into the car.





     The incessant drone of cars, steady overhead-

     Vast concrete supports edging the highway-

     BRANDON presses ELIZABETH flat again the grit of the wall

     Caught in the scissored half light, they move, with glorious
     abandon-

     The slice of passing headlights casting fractured light
     across their writhing state until-

     ELIZABETH gasps, her body shuddering, leaning into his as
     they climax together, sweat beading skin.





     BRANDON walking along the corridor-

     He reaches for his keys, suddenly hesitating on-

     The thump of music coming from his apartment-

     BRANDON tentatively turns his key and pushes the door open-




     BRANDON enters. He looks around, nothing-

     The turn of vinyl on the record player-

     I Feel Love by Donna Summer steadily rotating-

     BRANDON makes his way back to the corridor and notices a
     light on in the bathroom from the slit under the door.

     He opens up an adjacent cupboard and fishes out a baseball
     bat, and heads toward the bathroom.




     BRANDON steadily approaches the bathroom door, considers-

     He shoves it open, hard, baseball bat at the ready-




     BRANDON running, shrieking like a banshee, blinding waving
     the baseball bat, slicing air-




              
          I'll fucking kill you!-

SISSY SULLIVAN [mid/late 20's] leaps out of the bath, naked,
screaming and dripping wet-


          


          What the.. What the fuck?

SISSY holds her hurt elbow


          Fuck! Fuck! Ow! Fuck! -


          Jesus Christ Sissy.

BRANDON stands, shaking staring at his naked startled sister-


          Brandon. Don't you fucking knock?


          What the fuck. Why would I knock? I
          live here.


          Oh fuck.


          How'd you get in?


          Ow! You gave me fucking keys.


          Fuck.

BRANDON goes for a towel, shoving it towards her,
embarrassed. SISSY dries her face.


           You fucking scared me


          Don't I always say call me first if
          you're coming into town?


          Oh my god, I called you SO many
          times.

SISSY sighs.




                You have a fucking baseball bat?

     SISSY laughs. BRANDON relaxes. She tousles her hair.


                 Mmmm.
                What is this shit you put on your
                hair? Honestly, it's awful.

     BRANDON shakes his head, at a loss.


                Shampoo


                Is it for grooming dogs?

     SISSY throws the towel and BRANDON


                Good to see you.

     BRANDON throws the towel back at her.


                Lock the door next time.


                Yeah.

     BRANDON turns to leave the room


                Don't use all the towels


                I won't.

     BRANDON closes the door to the bathroom.




     We follow BRANDON as he walks through to the living room to
     the record player I Feel Love stuck in eternal groove. He
     gently lifts the needle off the record. He uses the baseball
     bat to pick up SISSY's scarf. He sniffs it.

     Silence-

     BRANDON stands considers-




     Later -



     BRANDON is watching pornography on his laptop, hears SISSY on
     the telephone. He listens.


               ..I want you. I don't want anyone
               else. There is no one else. I love
               you. I'll do anything.

     Pause


               I'll do anything. Please don't say
               that. Please don't say that.

     Pause


               I love you. I love you. I'll do
               anything. I'll do anything.


     BRANDON moves the laptop and starts to get up.





               I don't have to go out. I don't
               have to go out. I don't even
               fucking want to go out. I can stay
               with you. I don't care. I don't
               care. I don't need anybody else. I
               love you. I love you. I love you so
               much  I love you, please. I
               love you. I love you.




     BRANDON is listening at the door.


               Please  I feel sick. I feel
               really sick-

     BRANDON closes his eyes, resigned.






     BRANDON sliding whisked eggs into a pan of sizzling butter-

     SISSY enters and sits on the kitchen counter, wearing a long-
     sleeved white t-shirt and holding the earring left by the
     Pretty Woman [prostitute]. Dangling it in front of BRANDON-




          Morning. Nice earring. Hot date?

Hiding his surprise, BRANDON gets some juice out of the
fridge, passes it to SISSY.


          Juice?

BRANDON gives SISSY a carton of juice. Still sitting on the
counter, SISSY grabs it with both hands, almost like a
child's bottle and starts drinking.


          Mmm.

BRANDON, irritated, says abruptly-


          Will you use a glass?

BRANDON steps away, takes a glass from a cupboard and shoves
it towards her.


           Sorry.

SISSY pours the juice into the glass and drinks. BRANDON
steps back to the cooker, preparing food.


           You're going grey. Do you
          think I look fat?

BRANDON doesn't react.


          Do you think I look fat?

BRANDON nods in the direction of the table.


          Sit down.

She leaps off the counter and makes her way to the table. She
slaps BRANDON's behind. BRANDON's face is one of despair and
irritation.


           Fuck you!

SISSY slams her glass on an O/S table and throws the earring
away.




          I'm doing a couple of gigs.



BRANDON walks towards her with a pan of food.


          Yeah, sure.

BRANDON serves the food.


              
          Can I stay?

BRANDON hesitates-


          You want toast?


          Just for a few days.

BRANDON ignores her question and walks away to the kitchen.


          I'd stay with Mark but he's being a
          fucking asshole.

SISSY Stands and walks away, following BRANDON.


          Mark?

SISSY wraps her arms around BRANDON from behind.


           Jesus, Sissy.

BRANDON pushes her arms off, turns and walks to the fridge
with the juice.


          What do you expect?


          Pretty please?


          Look, you get the sofa and you get
          your ass off it-

SISSY leaps on his back smothering him with flat lipped
kisses all over his head until-


          Before I leave every morning.


           I will. I promise. I will
           Mwah!






     BRANDON pushes her down as she gives him a big kiss.


                Mwah!

     SISSY, happy, walks back to sit down at the table.





               We leave in fifteen.




     SISSY sprinkles salt on her breakfast. She smile, playful,
     resumes eating-


                Mmm. Mmmm!
                So good.!

     The door slams. SISSY sighs and stares towards the front
     door, a sadness hanging-




     SISSY stands, toes edging over the platform.   BRANDON pulls
     her back.


               Stop fucking around.

     SISSY stares at BRANDON. Instinctively, BRANDON feels her
     gaze. He turns and looks. They hold each other's eyes for
     more than a beat. BRANDON turns away. SISSY begins picking
     pieces of fluff off BRANDON's shoulder. BRANDON, visually
     irritated.

     SISSY goes again.


               Leave it.


               You have fluff.


               I like it there.

     A quick moment passes. BRANDON picks the fluff off his
     shoulder and puts it on SISSY's shoulder - to her amusement.







          How are you for money?


          I'm good.


          Cause if you need some money.


          Honestly, I even make money now and
          everything.


          Yeah, sure.


          Huge amounts.

BRANDON nods at SISSY's hat.


          Are you collecting mad hats?

Sissy smiles-


           You should come and hear
          me.


          Yeah. I will.


          `Yeah I will', like, `yeah I will'
          like last time? Please come.

BRANDON takes off her hat.


          Where'd you get this, anyway.


          It's vintage.


          Yeah, I can see that.




SISSY takes the hat and puts it on BRANDON.


          Wow.




                Do you like?

     BRANDON adjusts the hat.


               Yeah.

     SISSY gently bumps his shoulder with hers.


               Please come.


               Ok. I will.

     SISSY stamps her feet excitedly.


               Yaay!

     SISSY leans her head on BRANDON's shoulder and he puts his
     arm around her.




     BRANDON hurries into the office area, unbuckling his coat as
     he does so. DAVID, phone pressed to his ear, mid way through
     a conference call clocks him, throws some lewd gesture.

     BRANDON smiles, throws up his hands, he's late. What can you
     do...


               Sorry. Sorry.

     BRANDON continues into his office.


               Fuck, my computer.

     BRANDON puts down his coffee, and takes off his scarf.


               Well, well, well.


               Morning, asshole.


               Look who's decided to grace us with
               his presence.

     BRANDON puts his scarf in the closet and takes off his coat.


               Yeah.




               Don't tell me. No cabs.


               No, your wife wouldn't let me leave
               this morning.

     BRANDON hangs up his coat.


               Ah! Hey, that's not cool.




     BRANDON laughs as he sits down at his desk.


               You should be so lucky.


               Any calls?


               Yes. Like, fifty.

     BRANDON sips his coffee.




     BRANDON stands, in the coffee area making himself a generic
     filter coffee.

     MARIANNE is seated in her glass office in the background at
     her desk.

     DAVID approaches, slapping BRANDON on the ass.


               Hey! Heads up, buddy-?


                woah!


               So, how'd it go last night?

     BRANDON pours coffee, glancing at DAVID behind him.


               Yeah. Got home. Went to bed. Good
               night.

     DAVID looks at him, shakes his head in a knowing fashion.




               A-ha. Right, right. Let's do it
               again tonight. Some place classier
               though.


               Well... My sister's playing
               downtown somewhere.


               She's playing?


               She's a musician. Well, she's a
               singer.


               Okay. Yeah, yeah. You know what,
               that sounds er.. A lot of fun.
                   (taps coffee mug/walking
                    away)
               And that'll ruin your enamel.

     BRANDON watches DAVID walk into his office, shutting his door
     behind him.




     He turns right abruptly, pass the coffee area, and then right
     again. A COLLEAGUE is coming out of a door. He holds it open
     for BRANDON as he walks in. The door slowly closes, exposing
     the MEN'S sign for the bathroom.




     BRANDON and DAVID, not knowing what is to await them, walk
     towards the doors of the beautiful setting of THE BOOM BOOM



               That elevator music's like a bad
               acid trip.


               Good evening.


               Evening. Er.. Reservation.
               Sullivan?


               Great. I have you on the list. I'll
               have you follow me.

     BRANDON and DAVID take off their scarves and coats.




               Thank you.

     BRANDON and DAVID give their coats to FEMALE STAFF MEMBER.


               There you are.


               Right this way, please.


               Oh, wow, look at that ass. I could
               follow that forever.

     DAVID glances back at BRANDON


               Nice pick. 

     DAVID and BRANDON walk on towards the bar.




     BRANDON and DAVID enter a beautiful bar. A spectacular 180
     degree view of Manhattan. The room has the most elegant
     decor. It is to die for:

     Metropolis meets Blade Runner, a glittering New York skyline
     to the North of the room, the grey endless black of the
     Hudson River to the South.

     It surpasses DAVID's idea of classy.

     The murmur of conversation-

     The shake of cocktails mixed-


               Oh. Oh, I forgot how beautiful this
               city is.

     BRANDON and DAVID follow the HOSTESS to take a seat at a far
     table.


               Oh, thank you, thank you.

     A stunning leggy COCKTAIL WAITRESS walks up to the table,
     dressed in silky 1930's cigarette girl costume.


               Hi guys. How are you both doing
               tonight? What can I get you?




          Hi. Your.. Your accent. Are you..?
          Are you from erm..?


          Brazil.


              
          Rio. Hmmm?


          Sao Paulo.

BRANDON looks down and chuckles to himself.


          Oh! Oh, that is a beautiful city.
          That's..


           You've been there?


          Once or twice.


          Can we get two dry martinis with
          olives.


          Hm-hm.


          And a little bit later, why don't
          you come by for a drink with us?
          Hmm?


          I'll make sure I get those drinks.


          Thank you.


          Thanks.

The COCKTAIL WAITRESS smiles, moving on, she's heard it all
before.

DAVID smiles, clocks BRANDON's look.


          She would be offended if I didn't
          try.

BRANDON shakes his head and looks down.




          Unbelievable.


          Ah. 

DAVID and BRANDON look around the room

DAVID and BRANDON are fortunate to be here. The clink of
glasses, the noise of laughter waft through the room.

Across the room, a familiar face.

Her wavering a little at first on seeing BRANDON across the
room. Their eyes lock.

She smiles, with quiet surprise-

BRANDON looks away, ignoring SISSY's gaze, not wanting to
look at her. SISSY plays on, inwardly crestfallen, her
fingers working across the piano keys.

DAVID leans back, eyes grazing over SISSY, a kind of white
noise to SISSY's beautiful music-

The seeping first bars of `New York New York' filtering
through-


              
          Start spreading the news. I'm
          leaving today. I want to be a part
          of it. New York..New York.

It's a familiar song but in SISSY's hands, every word
punctures like an emotional fireburst-

SISSY's voice is oddly haunting underscoring the bubble of
conversation,


              
          I want to wake up in a city that
          doesn't sleep. And find I'm king of
          the hill, top of the heap.

SISSY's eyes dart back to BRANDON, seemingly lost in his
conversation, but competing now with SISSY and her song-


              
          My little town blues-

Suddenly SISSY's fingers drop from the piano, her whole body
curving into the microphone offering a blues vocal acoustic,
slowly but quietly captivating-




          They're melting away. I gonna make
          a brand new start of it.

Even DAVID's listening now-


              
          In old New York....

SISSY's up moving now, she is completely lost in the song and
the room is coming with her-


BRANDON concedes,looking back at SISSY, now holding the room.


              
          If I can make it there-

A kind of hushed still has descended-


              
          I'll make it anywhere. It's up to
          you..New york, New york. New York,
          New York-

SISSY comes closer, walking between the tables, flirting and
laughing and drawing the audience in until they are in the
palm of her hand.


              
          I want to wake up in a city, that
          never sleeps...And find I'm a
          number one-

SISSY grazes past BRANDON's table, eyes catching on BRANDON,
singing for him now-


              
          Top of the list, king
          of the hill-

BRANDON drinks, not looking at SISSY. She closes her eyes,
tears stinging, reeling back into herself-


              
          A number one...

SISSY draws out the note, bringing the song momentarily to a
silence-



SISSY's misty eyes open as BRANDON at last looks at her, the
moment oddly fragile between them, brutal and yet tender.
Even DAVID sensing something until-


              
          These little town blues-

SISSY turns, makes her way back to the piano, enjoying it now-


              
          Are melting away...

Fingers touching the keys once more, masterfully picking up
and improvising with the last few bars-


              
          I'm gonna make a brand new start of
          it - in old
          New York..

SISSY leans back. She is on fire now, singing with every
fibre of her heart and soul, like no other rendition heard.


              
          And if I can make it there, I'm
          gonna make it
          anywhere It's up to you-

SISSY holds BRANDON with a voice, a sudden flickering emotion
threatening to topple her, somehow in SISSY's hands this song
is heartbreaking...


                
          New   york New york
                
          New   York..New York..
                
          New   york New york
                
          New   york New york.

SISSY strikes one last note, lost deep within herself-




          Wow. Wow! Bravo!

Sudden APPLAUSE, CHEERS, OVERWHELMING-

DAVID turns to BRANDON




                She's good! She's good!

     BRANDON looks away, eyes filling with tears.

     BRANDON puts down his drink, blotting his coaster with the
     imprint of the deep red rim of his glass-

     He's the only one not applauding.




     SISSY is being congratulated by a HIP MEDIA TYPE and his
     WIFE. The scene is one of congratulations, SISSY is admired.

     SISSY confident approaches DAVID and BRANDON. She is bold and
     self-aware.


               Hi.


               Hi.


               I'm David.


               Sissy.


               It's a pleasure to meet you.


               Nice to meet you.


               I think you were fantastic and you
               look great in the dress, too.
               Please sit down.


               Thank you.  What did
               you think?


               Yeah, it was... interesting.


                What do you mean?


               Er.. No, it was, er.. It was good.
               It was good.

     DAVID finishes his martini.




          It was good?


          He was crying. He was crying. THere
          were tears coming down his face. I
          saw it. You made a grown-man cry.


          Really?


          Hm-hmm.


          I'm gonna get some more drinks.


          That's a great idea. Why don't you
          get a round for the table, buddy?


          Yeah.

Brandon exits.


          OK, I'm really sorry about that,
          I.. He's had a rough day at work. I
          think he's a bit emotional right
          now.


          Yeah.


          Yeah.
              
          So you guys grew up in Jersey,
          right?


          Yeah.


          Hmm. You still live there?


          GOD, no.


          That's good. That's good. Where do
          you live now?


          Kind of all over the place.




          Yeah? What's the last city you've
          been to?





          Los Angeles?


          Mm-Hmm.


          Oh boy. You like it there?


          I mean, I'm going back.


          That must mean you love it then,
          huh?


          No! I can't even fucking drive.
          It's a nightmare.

BRANDON reappears.


           Whoa, wait a minute, wait
          a minute. You can't drive?


          No.


          Why not?


          I tried when I was a kid, and I was
          horrible.


          Wait, how old were you when you
          quit driving.


          Sixteen.


          You were 16 years old?


          Mmhmm.




          So wait, wait, wait a minute. How
          do you get along in Los Angeles?

BRANDON sits behind them.


          I take the bus.


          No, no, no, no, no no. Look, look.

DAVID takes SISSY's hand. BRANDON notices, looking
uncomfortable.


          A girl like you cannot be taking
          the bus.

One of Sissy's sleeves rolls down to her elbow, as she
casually puts her hand under her chin, charmingly tilting her
head - revealing a cross stitch of scars, the trail of self
harm laced up her arm. DAVID noticies.


          What.. Waht happened to your arm
          here?


          Oh, just.. When I was a kid I was
          bored.

SISSY takes her hand back.


          Well, you must have been really
          bored.


          I was.


          Alright, we've got a problem. your
          sister cannot be taking the bus
          anywhere. OK. I know a guy who owns
          a car rental company. We're gonna
          get you a car, we're going to drive
          around in circles in a parking lot
          and you are going to learn how to
          drive.


          Not a stick, automatic. It's a
          little easier.


          I would love that.




          You'd love that. That's good. You
          know what? Better yet..


          We're going to get you a golf cart.
          We're gonna get you a gold cart and
          you will drive the golf cart
          around.


          Wow, now we're talking. I
          would..yeah.


          Yeah, yeah, yeah.


          Everybody should drive golf carts.


          A golf cart right up Fifth Avenue,
          huh? 

SISSY sips her drink.


           Mmm.


          You know, they should They should.
          It would be a lot cleaner and
          greener. It would be great for the
          city. Brandon, what do you think?


          Sounds great.


          Yeah?

DAVID looks at BRANDON. BRANDON looks like he would rather be
anywhere than where he is now.


               
          I love your, brother. What an
          amazing man. How long are you here
          for?


          I don't know.


          You don't know? Can I see you
          again? Please?

Sissy laughs.




               Is that too forward? I just.. I
               find you fascinating, I really do.
               I think you're a fascinating
               creature, I'd love to see you
               again.
                   
               Listen, why don't we.. this is a
               celebration, let's have champagne.


               Yes!


               Champagne for everybody. For the
               whole table. Come on!


               Champagne!

     BRANDON looks unenthusiastic


               Champagne.






     BRANDON wedged in the back of the cab, with DAVID and SISSY
     as they are lost eating one another's faces.

     Looking uncomfortable, BRANDON frequently takes glimpses in
     the rear view mirror.

     DAVID and SISSY continue making out. It's almost animal.




     A dimly lit street-

     A cab is pulling up. DAVID opens the door.


               I've got it, I've got it. Get out,
               get out, get out, get out.

     DAVID is wearing SISSY's hat.


               Come here, come here, come here,
               come here.

     Finally SISSY steps out of the cab, DAVID lifts her over his
     shoulder.




                 


                  Come on, come on with me,
                 come on...


                 Get off. Get off. Get off.


                 You wanted me to do that. How did
                 that work?


                 Get off me.

     SISSY starts to enter thru the revolving door. DAVID follows


                 Ah come on, come on, come on, come
                 on, come on...

     BRANDON is left alone to pay the driver.




     BRANDON waits in the lobby, pressing the button for the
     elevator. An elevator arrives. He ignores it and sits down.




     Darkness-

     BRANDON enter his apartment door.

     He hears giggling from his bedroom.


                  Well, I am hot, I am hot.


                 You are hot.


                 

     BRANDON walks to his kitchen.

     HE hits the kitchen cabinet in frustration.

     He walks into the living area and paces.

     BRANDON considers, looking out through the window, he sits on
     the ledge, wringing his hands.




               No!





               You're cursing me. I need to take
               this off. I'm hot. I need to take
               it off. I'm hot.


               Nice sheets


               Aren't they nice sheet? Bed, bath
               and beyond. Stop..

     MORE GIGGLING, hushed now, more breathless-


               What if I kiss you right here...?
               About here.

     BRANDON takes off his shoes and starts to undress. We hear
     SISSY and DAVID making love.





               Yeah?

     BRANDON doesn't want to hear. BRANDON stands back against a
     wall, as if transfixed, as if he cannot take any more. His
     breathing is irregular. Something of the past has come to the
     present. All of his distractions have now stopped, and he is
     at once confronted with himself.

     His face bears the pain of something long passed, but
     visually present. This wound has not healed.

     Jolting himself out of his trance, BRANDON hurriedly heads
     out into the corridor-




     BRANDON pulls running gear from the hallway closet an exits,
     leaving the RISING BREATH of DAVID and SISSY LOST IN FURTIVE






     A dimly lit street-



     BRANDON just visible in his apartment block steady on the
     approach. He is dressed in running gear.

     Pushing the glass doors open, BRANDON hesitates and presses a
     button on the iPod Nano on his arm. He stretches, zips his
     top, pulling his hood up.

     BRANDON slips his earphones on, moving off.




     BRANDON running past illuminated windows and neon lights. The
     city is alive. BRANDON stays focused, running, music pumping
     in his head.




     Later

     BRANDON enters his apartment checking for noises.

     The sound of movement in the bathroom.

     He pushes open his bedroom door. It's like a murder scene.
     Pale blue sheets in disarray, the mattress nearly coming off
     the bed, sheets soaked with sweat and the smell of sex.

     A lone condom disregarded on the floor.

     We see his bedside drawer ajar.

     He walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut.




     Later -

     BRANDON lies on his bed, with clean white sheets, sidelight
     on.

     SISSY enters. BRANDON opens his eyes, inwardly flinches.

     SISSY gets into the bed, covering herself with the white
     sheet. Snuggles up to BRANDON


               I have to be up and out by seven.

     SISSY inhales through her teeth.


                   
               It's cold.

     Uncomfortable SILENCE-




               Sissy, get out of my room?

     SISSY doesn't move.


               Sissy, get out of my room.

     All this time, BRANDON has not looked at SISSY, staring up to
     the blank ceiling. He SCREAMS at the top of his lungs-




     SISSY gets up, deliberate, as if rising from the dead, and
     slowly walks around the bed.

     SISSY SLAMS the bedroom door on her exit.




     Midday-

     The office is in full flow-

     BRANDON crosses it, clearly worse for wear.

     A TECHNICIAN wheels a computer out of BRANDON's office.


                   
               Hey slacker, your computer's back.

     BRANDON heads towards his desk, stopping on seeing-


               Dave's looking for you.

     STEVEN exits again.

     BRANDON observes, his computer is back at his desk.




     BRANDON puts his head around the-


                Yeah, yeah. It was
               really great last night.


                Daddy, daddy.


                Ah, listen, I gotta
               go. OK, thanks for calling.




           Hey, buddy.


          Er, listen, we said an hour French
          and then Isobel's gonna pick you up
          because Mommy's picking up Nathan.
          Alright? You can go after.


          Yeah, I know. But Mommy says I
          can't


          OK, well. Let's go talk to Mommy
          hmm..?


          Aw.. She's all the way downstairs.


          Well, go downstairs and tell her
          that Daddy said it's okay for you
          to go to Jason's


          Ohhh..


          Hah? Come on. How about that? Do
          it. YOu can do it. Get up.





          Yeah.


          Mommy? Mommy?

DAVID's SON exits the computer screen. David looks up at



           What's up, man?


          Well, Steven said you wanted to see
          me?


          Yeah. Er, Dude. Nine o'clock this
          morning, where were you?


          Dentist. Root canal.




          Oh, shit. Now, what did I tell you
          about that? Who d'you see?


          Gary Sher... King's practice, West
          57th street.


          Good. Good. You're stinging that
          company health care plan, I hope,
          right?


          Sure.


          That's what it's there for, man.
          Alright brother.

BRANDON turns to leave.


          Listen, one more thing.

BRANDON turns back.


          Your hard drive is filthy, all
          right. We got your computer back. I
          mean, it is, it is, dirty. I'm
          talking like hoes, sluts, anal,
          double anal, penetration, inter
          racial facial, man. Cream pie. I
          don't even know what that is.



          Do you think it was your intern?

DAVID finally looks up, holds BRANDON's gaze, with discreet
challenge until-


              
          On my hard drive?

DAVID nods, resumes working-


          Yeah, someone's fucking with your
          account, man.And we're blowing our
          wad in cash, you know? It takes a
          really really sick fuck to spend
          all day on that shit.

BRANDON nods, makes to go.



     From beyond-


               Daddy...Daddy...

     BRANDON exits.


               Yeah. Hey buddy, Er, what she say?


               She said I can go to Jason's for
               half an hour but I have to be home
               by five for dinner.


               OK. That's great. See? Best of both
               worlds. You got everything you
               want.

     BRANDON takes this opportunity to leave.


               Yep.


               You happy?


               Yeah.


               Yeah. You better be. Get out of
               here.


               OK. Alright. See you




     DAVID looks up, watches BRANDON heading back to his desk,
     quietly considering.

     A child's painting stuck to the wall behind DAVID.






     BRANDON, lost in familiar routine, pours sugar into his
     coffee-


               Hey-

     BRANDON looks up, MARIANNE loiters-




               Hey.


               You like your sugar.


                   
               I do.

     MARIANNE is still standing, waiting. They look at each other.
     Eventually she turns and walks out.




     BRANDON stands at the end of a long pier, looking out toward
     the Hudson River, the LAP of murky water, audible. He hovers
     for a moment, and considers, then slowly makes his way back
     to the main road.

     The glittering lights of Jersey stretching wide beyond.




     Above, the tall, endless glass of The Standard Hotel, scored
     with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny
     still lives.

     BRANDON comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans.
     Above him, engraved in stone is "1949." He looks up toward
     the tall building, which appears like a Stasi East Berlin
     building. Stark and authoritative.

     A KID slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor
     window, a FILIPINO NANNY ushers him away.

     A WOMAN, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans
     and t-shirt, paces along the window. Catching sight of
     BRANDON, she PULLS the curtain along the length of the glass.

     A MAN stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and
     jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up.

     A FEMALE CLEANER just visible lost in the monotony of
     cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy
     duster.

     And then BRANDON sees her-

     A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN stands, naked her body pressed against
     the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the Hudson
     River. The steady back and forth of the MIDDLE AGED MAN
     behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up
     fuck.



     BRANDON hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his
     face as for a brief flickering moment BRANDON's eyes lock
     with the MIDDLE AGED WOMAN's dead gaze, standing high above-



     BRANDON turns, his hypnotism broken. It's as if he comes back
     to himself.




     A distant restaurant illuminating a dimly lit street-

     MARIANNE waiting inside the bar, seated, with a drink,
     clearly there for some time. Her eyes checking the room, with
     quiet concern.

     BRANDON stands watching from a distance-

     BRANDON makes to cross, hovering on the edge of the gutter
     until-




     BRANDON enters the restaurant.


               Hi.


               Hello-


               Hello. 


               Did you find it okay?


               Yes, I'm glad you made it.


               Oh, yeah. I'm late. Sorry.

     BRANDON sits down at the table where MARIANNE is already
     seated.


               You look handsome.


               You look amazing.

     A WAITER enters.




          Hi.

WAITER places the wine list in front of BRANDON and hands out
menus.


          Thank you.





          Thanks.


          I have few specials on the menu, if
          you'd like to hear them?

MARIANNE smiles, eyes darting to BRANDON, playful. The WAITER
oblivious, clearly on a roll.


          Sure.


          Erm.. The soup of the day is tomato
          with basil oil and Parmesan
          crostini. The special is marinated
          swordfish, tabbouleh and Moroccan
          Chermoula. It's really good. Er,
          we're also serving a DeBragga and
          Spitler New York Strip with a side
          order of fries and the salad is
          snow pea and radish with a cider
          vinaigrette. Can I start you off
          with a sparkling water?

BRANDON nods, -


          Tap water's fine.


          OK and the wine menu's right next
          to you. Yep. There you go-

BRANDON pulls out a wine menu hidden under his bread plate.


          You want some wine?


          Sure.


          White? Red?




          Red maybe..

The WAITER hovers, points to a red on the menu-


          The Pinot Noir is er..light..
          Erm.If you like it like.. Light.

The GLIDE of a napkin across BRANDON's lap, the WAITER a
constant presence, on the edge of irritating.


          Great.


          OK. I'll be back.

The WAITER smiles, at last moves off-

They sit looking at their menus.

BRANDON steals a moment, eyes tracing over-

MARIANNE's fingers playing with the edge of her menu-

The flutter of her lashes-

Nipples ghosting her dress.

An ring indent around her wedding finger, the shrink of skin.


          So  Where do you
          live? 


           Brooklyn.


          Nice.


          Born and raised. Where you from?


          Where you from?


          I was born in Ireland. We moved
          here when I was a teen.

The WAITER enters again, with water.


          Do you get back much? 
          Thank you.



WAITER pours water for MARIANNE


          A couple of times.


          A big family? You miss them?


          Er.. I have a sister.


          I have two.


          Oh, yeah?


          Yeah.


          Older, younger?


          Older and younger. I'm in the
          middle.

BRANDON stares at MARIANNE


          What?


          Just wondering.


           are you nervous?


          Why would I be nervous?

MARIANNE smiles, holds his look.


          You look a little nervous.


          Do I? No.


          Well, what's a date?

BRANDON shrugs-


          It's no big deal.




          It took me an hour to figure out
          what to wear.


          You chose wisely.

MARIANNE shrugs, smiles-

BRANDON laughs-

The WAITER returns-


          I forgot to say the crab comes in
          the shell.


          Great.

The WAITER pauses, expectantly.


          Oh. Yeah... I haven't even looked
          at this.


          Erm, I'll have the lamb.

The WAITER scrawls it down on a pad, barely looking up.


          The Lamb.


          I'll have the Lamb too. That sounds
          great.





          Erm, No appetizer?


              
          You want-?

MARIANNE shrugs, closes her menu.


          I'm fine.


          No.




          OK, and how would you like the
          lamb?


          Medium.


          We recommend it pretty pink.

The WAITER waits-

BRANDON looks at MARIANNE, they giggle.





          Hm-hm.


          Pink it is.

The WAITER takes the menus. MARIANNE stares at BRANDON.


          Thank you. Excuse me.

The WAITER exits.


          So, you seeing anyone at the
          moment?


          No.


          No. Really? Why? Why is that?


          I don't know. Just er, it's just
          the way it is.


          It's just the way it is. Yeah, I
          erm... actually, I'm separated.


          Right.

The dip of skin, soft under her chin, a finger grazing over
it, nervously.


          Yeah. Kind of a recent thing.




          OK. You were married for long?


          No.

The WAITER returns.


          Did we decide on the wine?

BRANDON hesitates, on the edge but-


          Erm, well, yeah erm.. The Pinot..
          Was it the Pinot Noir, you said?

BRANDON scours the wine menu at a loss-

BRANDON looks to MARIANNE, she shrugs-


          Yeah, great..Great choice. OK.

The WAITER nods, at last moves off-


          I wasn't married long. Gave it a
          shot. It didn't really work out.


          No.


          Wow.


          What?


          Well, you just seem, like..



          What?


          ...averse to the whole idea.


          Well, yeah. I mean, I just don't
          understand why people would want to
          get married. Especially nowadays, I
          mean, it's.. You know.. I don't see
          the point.


          In relationships?




          It doesn't seem realistic.

MARIANNE considers, lips grazing the rim of the glass.


          Are you serious? I mean..


          Yeah, I am, really.


           Well, then, you know, why
          are we here, if we don't matter to
          one another?


          Well..


          Why are you here?


          The food's supposed to be really
          great here. 

MARIANNE nods, doesn't look amused-



          No, no, no, no. I'm not.. I'm not
          saying it like that. I mean, I just
          mean, you know.. One person for the
          rest of your life? I mean, it's.. I
          mean, you know, you come to
          restaurants, you see couples
          sitting together and they don't
          even speak to one another. They
          don't have anything to say, they
          don't have anything.


          They probably don't have to speak
          because they're connected.


          Or they're just bored with one
          another.


          Every..

The WAITER approaches, a bottle of wine in hand.


          Here we go.

The WAITER uncorks the wine.




                  What's your longest relationship?


                  Erm..

     He pours a little into BRANDON's glass.


                  Exactly.

     BRANDON gestures for the WAITER to pour.


                  Oh, that's.. you can pour.


                  Sure.

     WAITER fills BRANDON's glass.


                  Four months.

     WAITER finishes pouring BRANDON's wine and starts filling
     MARIANNE's.


                  You have to commit. You have to
                  actually give it a shot.


                  I did.. .. For four months.


                  I'll leave the bottle.

     The WAITER slides the bottle down, moving off-


                  For four months.




     A dirty grey street, brightened by the glow of BRANDON and
     MARIANNE seated inside the restaurant.






     BRANDON and MARIANNE stand heady from the wine and a little
     awkward in the freezing cold-

     They walk-



BRANDON sneaks a side glance, MARIANNE smiles. It's freezing.
They're breath and bodies steaming as they walk.


          Thank you.




          Look, touch that.

BRANDON bows, pointing to the back of his head.


          Your head?

MARIANNE turns to touch BRANDON's head. As she does so, he
GROWLS at her, like a little dog.




MARIANNE shrieks.

They BOTH laugh.


           Oh, no, no, no...


           You're such a.. Weirdo.

She pushes him playfully.


          No, seriously, seriously. Touch it.




There's a massive knot on the back of his head.


          Oh, my God.


          Do you feel that?


          Yeah, what is it?


          It's a remnant.


          A remnant?




          Yeah, from the Neanderthals.
          There's only a few of us left since
          the homo sapiens took over.


          OK. Hmm.. That would explain the
          forehead.


          What's that supposed to mean?


          `What's that supposed to mean?'


          What do you mean?


           No, seriously, how did
          you get it?


           I used to play this game
          with my cousin.


          Hm-hmm.


          Where I would sit on his feet and
          he'd fly me through the air. I hit
          my head on the ceiling and I
          blacked out.

They both laugh. Marianne laughs hysterically. BRANDON laughs
along.


          I was knocked out for 5-10 minutes.
          I peed my pants.


           Oh.


          If you had a choice to live in the
          past or future and you could be
          anything you wanted, what would you
          be?


          What would you be?


          I always wanted to be a musician in
          the sixties.




          That's cool A musician?


          Yeah.


          Sixties is tough though. I saw
          GIMME SHELTER recently, you know
          the Rolling Stones documentary?


          Yeah.


          It kind of seemed like hell.


          What?


           Yeah, the sixties would be
          the last place I'd want to be.


          No way!


          Yes. Eugh, chaos!


          So where would you wanna, and what
          would you wanna be?


          Erm.. You know. Here, now.


          That's boring


          Fuck you. 

Still walking along, BRANDON thinks for a moment. BRANDON
turns and stares at MARIANNE, holding his gaze. MARIANNE
blushes. There's a silence as they walk on. They get to a
subway entrance.


          OK. Well, this is me.

BRANDON nods, hovers by the subway, awkward and yet-


          This is you.

They stand heady from the wine and a little awkward.




                 Thank you very much Brandon.


                 Thank you very much MARIANNE. We
                 should do this again.



     They loiter on the edge of something more.


                 Right.



     BRANDON hovers, momentarily fragile, the sting of
     uncertainty. MARIANNE descends into the depths of the subway,
     with a half wave.


                 So, is that a yes?


                 Maybe, yeah.




     The CLICK of the door-

     BRANDON enters. The sound of the record player, which had
     finished hours ago, rotates empty on the turntable.

     Pulling off his jacket-


                 Hello? Sissy?



     BRANDON puts the needle back in it's dock. HE hangs up his
     jacket, takes his bag, heads towards the living room. He
     spies all SISSY's crap spilling out across the floor-

     He sighs.

     Heads to the kitchen and gets a can out of the fridge.




     The lock of the front door rotates. Someone is entering the
     apartment.

     Darkness-

     SISSY bursts through the door, in a hurry.



     After a moment the bathroom door opens, cutting a slit of
     light into the darkness.

     From the blackness we see BRANDON framed, masturbating in
     front of the bathroom sink.

     SISSY, shocked, stands with her hand still on the door
     handle, transfixed by a naked BRANDON.

     As BRANDON instinctively turns, SISSY runs from view.

     SISSY slams the door shut.


               Oh! Fuck!


                Fuck!

     BRANDON looks at himself in the mirror, full of shame and
     bewilderment and deep embarrassment.

     Slowly but surely these expressions turn into rage. He hits
     the wall in frustration.


               Fuck!




     BRANDON opens the bathroom door, with towel tied around his
     waist, looking for SISSY.


               What? Are you fucking spying on me?


                Lock the fucking door,
               Brandon.


               Are you fucking spying?


                Uhh.. Are you
               fucking spying?


     BRANDON leans over SISSY, pushes her down onto the sofa.


               Fuck!  Brandon..


               What do you want? What do you want?

     BRANDON climbs onto SISSY, straddling her.




          Oh, you wanna fight? You wanna
          fight? You wanna fight? You wanna
          fight?


          Yeah? You want some of this? You
          want some of this?

BRANDON's towel falls down as he forcefully pins her down.


          You wanna fight? You wanna fight?
          You wanna.


          What do you want from me? What do
          you want from me?


          Brandon!

BRANDON shakes SISSY by the shoulders. She reacts, upset now.


           What do you want?


           Get off me!


           Why did you come here?
          Why?


          Get off me! Get off me!


          Why?


          Get of me!


          Why?!


          Ow! You're fucking hurting me.


          Talk to me! You fucking bitch!


          Fucking get the fuck off, you
          fucking weirdo.

BRANDON stands and exits. SISSY shouting after him.




               Fucking slut!





     BRANDON locks the bathroom door.

     He exhales, letting the moment slowly pass until-


               Brandon-

     BRANDON lowers himself onto the floow, desperately struggling
     with his emotions-

     He closes his eyes, eyelashes fragile and flickering until-

     BRANDON opens them, reaches a hand out, almost mechanically,
     turns up the shower, the room now swirling in steam, trying
     to drown SISSY's voice out.


               Brandon, I'm sorry.

     BRANDON closes his eyes, tears pricking-




     SISSY walking back from kitchen, resigned-

     BRANDON's laptop on and open on his desk.

     SISSY approaches it, sinking down in front of the illuminated
     laptop.

     She absently taps the mouse, dragging open a series of held
     windows, the shifting lights of the screen cast across her
     face, revealing-

     Slowly SISSY's face changes, a blurred smorgasbord of porn
     sites, graphic and obscene, their colors reflecting across
     her face and body. An escalating collage of graphic images,
     obscene sexual messages and a provocative sexual conversation
     hanging mid sentence addressed to a live sex chatroom. The
     images haunting, brutal, from the weird to the
     sadomasochistic. The open windows, an endless stacking of
     obscene chatroom conversation, emails posted with graphic
     sexual photos and live webcam images of every combination of
     fucking disappearing into the screen in infinite form.

     SISSY is taken aback and strangely intrigued-

     Suddenly a voice from the screen, images briefly glimpsed, a
     woman legs splayed-




               Hey, where's Brandon? Are you
               Brandon's girlfriend? Do you want
               to play?

     SISSY looks closer, mildly appalled.


               Do you wanna play with my tits? I
               know Brandon would really like it..
               And I know exactly what Brandon
               likes.

     BRANDON picks up the laptop and heads towards his bedroom.

     SISSY takes her coat and leaves the apartment.






     The thump of music-

     BRANDON sitting on the edge of his bed, the pumping music
     from a stereo in the apartment seemingly getting louder,
     hands grasping his hair. Then suddenly he enters the whole
     contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag.

     Then, BRANDON moving like a dervish through the apartment, a
     black garbage bag in his hand, dumping pieces of paper, post
     it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone
     numbers on the back.

     BRANDON moves on, picking up anything he can find. An old
     jacket, elbows worn. A handful of old t-shirts.

     He moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy, grabbing
     more crap along the way, one of SISSY's dirty thongs on the
     floor. He picks it up, moving on.




     An open fridge-

     BRANDON tipping bowls of old food and long past it sell by
     date mush into the bag.

     Cans of Red Bull, crappy cereals, jam with mould on top, an
     old joint, magazines all get dumped on route.

     BRANDON heads out, picking up more detritus along the way,
     old pens, an old cellphone, a pair of defunked headphones-

     A pile of porn mags, in a cupboard, pulled out as he heads
     down along the corridor.





     BRANDON strips the room, pulling out an old pair of sneakers
     smelling and cracked from under a chair. He peers up, looks
     around the room almost bare-

     His laptop resting on his desk. BRANDON stops, considers,
     initially resistant and then something finally compels him to
     do it-

     He picks up the laptop, yanking the plug hard from the wall.
     Dumping it inside the garbage bag, he moves on picking up an
     ipod, a gameboy, ipod nano, wires and cables and stuff.
     Slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage, he drags the
     heaving bag of crap out into the corridor.

     The SLAM of the front door-




     BRANDON heading down the steps of his apartment, heaving the
     swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on
     the sidewalk. A pile of black garbage bags already piled up
     along the street in waiting for collection.

     Further down the street a YOUNG COUPLE holds hands, walks by
     the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk.

     A SIREN goes past-

     The DISTANT banter of a GANG OF KIDS.

     BRANDON heads back up to his apartment, shutting the door
     firmly.




     BRANDON, now the voyeur, looks across the room, into
     MARIANNE's office. He studies her, almost like prey. The
     moment seems to last a lifetime. There is much want in
     BRANDON's face, but from this distance seems unobtainable.

     Suddenly, and without any warning, BRANDON walks into his
     dream, entering MARIANNE's office, and pulls her behind a
     partition, kissing her unapologetically and passionately.

     She responds, startled, but happy to be taken. She
     surrenders.

     They pull away, looking at one another. She smiles,
     laughing, his spirit infectious, drawing her on.


               Come on.

     BRANDON leads MARIANNE away.





     BRANDON and MARIANNE stepping out of a cab, BRANDON leading
     MARIANNE, both giggling and tripping.


               Where are you taking me? 


               Come on. You'll see

     MARIANNE stops. She smiles, quizzically, allowing herself to
     be guided and yet-


               No, where are we going? 


               Come on.




     BRANDON snorts two lines of coke in quick succession on top
     of the white water tank in the toilet.

     Exiting, we see MARIANNE looking out onto the Hudson from the
     large hotel window.




     BRANDON enters the bedroom, stopping to prepare a drink.
     Watching MARIANNE at the window.


               You wanna drink?

     He pours a drink from the mini bar.


               What are you looking at?


               The view is amazing.

     BRANDON approaches nervously, standing next to her.


               Hey.

     MARIANNE leans up and kisses BRANDON.






     MARIANNE takes BRANDON's hand and leads him to the bed. We
     see both of them slowly discovering each other through tender
     touches.

     MARIANNE caresses BRANDON's face and kisses both his eyes.
     BRANDON attempts to do the same to MARIANNE, slowly but
     surely. This ritual becomes more aroused, clothes start to
     fall away, revealing for the first time both each other's
     flesh.

     BRANDON rolls up her skirt, laughs at her panites. MARIANNE
     giggles.


                Are they vintage?


               A little bit. 

     The ritual begins to get more passionate, as they feel for
     each other's breasts and thighs.

     At the height of this passionate encounter, BRANDON's
     attention strangely, slowly starts to fade. It's as if the
     intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him.

     He recoils, unable to continue.

     Both lie on their backs silently, in frustration, breathing
     heavily. MARIANNE's face is one of puzzlement and hurt. She
     looks at BRANDON for some kind of answer. He gets up.
     MARIANNE, unsure what to do, sits up and pulls down her
     skirt, adjusts her hair.




     Late afternoon sunlight seeping across the room-

     BRANDON sits at the edge of the bath looking out onto the
     view.


               Brandon? Erm...

     MARIANNE looks at him, the moment fragile. She does up her
     bra.


               You know, it's cool. It's OK.


               Should I go?


               Sure.



     Hurt, MARIANNE put on her top, picks up her bag and makes to
     leave




                I can walk you down.


                That's OK.



     BRANDON looks back out over the grey of the Hudson River.
     BRANDON's face is one of embarrassment and failure.

     The CLICK of the door, MARIANNE gone.

     The HUM of the traffic, audible through an ajar window.

     BRANDON reaches his hand out, catching the breeze, peering
     down, a man on the edge.




     BRANDON banging the life out of HOTEL LOVER, doggy style,
     tits pressed up against the glass of the window-

     The DISTANT SCREECH of horns.




     The trawl of cars-

     The grey of the Hudson River-

     BRANDON and the HOTEL LOVER just visible high above, caught
     full frontal in the window-




     BRANDON close to climax-

     A cold sweat beading BRANDON's forehead as he comes, face
     twisted before the slow seep of release.

     BRANDON withdraws, laughs. The HOTEL LOVER laughs as well.

     BRANDON turns, for a moment she is almost beautiful.

     HOTEL LOVER smiles, already pulling on her underwear. BRANDON
     watches her, pulling on a tiny thong. She looks up, stares at
     him.

     BRANDON looks away, fighting back the cold flutter of shame.




               Can I get you a drink?

     HOTEL LOVER hesitates, smile, shakes her head.


               No.

     BRANDON nods. HOTEL LOVER fingers fastening a cheap nylon
     bra.


               Fuck.


               Need a hand?


               The hooks odd-


                There you go.




     BRANDON sits on the bed, now alone, caught in the half light
     of dusk-

     The rise and fall of a distant lift.




     BRANDON is sitting on the couch, watching a cartoon. SISSY
     enters the apartment, on her cell phone. BRANDON ignores her


                David?.. Pick up. I
               take it you're at your pottery
               class.

     SISSY hangs up.


               Have you eaten?


               No.


               Are you hungry?


               No.

     SISSY Sits down next to BRANDON on the couch.




          Can you just give me a hug?

BRANDON puts him arm around her. She snuggles up to him.


          He's not gonna screw you again.





          You left a message didn't you? You
          can't help yourself. It's
          disgusting.


          Why are you so fucking angry?


          Why am I so fucking angry? That's
          my boss! You sleep with him after
          twenty minutes and now you're
          calling him up? What's the matter
          with you? You know he's got a
          family, right? You know he's got a
          family?


          No.


          You didn't see the wedding ring on
          his finger?


          No.


          You're a liar.


          I'm sorry


          You're always sorry.


          At least-


          That's all you ever fucking say!


          Well, least I say I'm sorry.




          Try doing something, actions count!
          Not words.


          I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I fucked up.
          I'm not perfect. But I'm...trying.


          Some people fuck up all the time.

Pause.

BRANDON removes his arm from around SISSY.


          Look, just forget it. This isn't
          working out. Obviously. You need to
          find somewhere else to live.


          I don't have anywhere else to go.
               
          This isn't about him. I make you
          angry all the time and I don't know
          why.


          No. You trap me. You force me into
          a corner and you trap me. "I've got
          nowhere else to go." I mean, what
          sort of fucking shit is that?


          You're my brother.


          So what, I'm responsible for you?


          Yes!


          No I'm not!


          Yes you fucking are!


          I didn't give birth to you! I
          didn't bring you into this world.


          You're my brother, I'm your
          sisterm. We're family. We're meant
          to look after each other.




          You're not looking after me.


          I'm-


          I'm looking after myself.


          I'm trying to help you!


          How are you helping me? Huh? How
          are you helping me?

BRANDON grips SISSY's face in his hand.


          How are you helping me? Huh? Look
          at me. How are you helping me? You
          come in here, and you're a weight
          on me. Do you understand me? You're
          a burden. You're just fucking
          dragging me down. You can't even
          clean up after yourself. Stop
          playing the victim.


          I'm not playing the fucking victim.
          If I left now, I'd never hear from
          you again.

SISSY pulls BRANDON's hand away.


          Don't you think that's sad? Don't
          you think that's sad? You're my
          brother.


          Why is it always so dramatic with
          you? Everything is always the end
          of the world.


          It's not fucking dramatic. I'm
          trying to talk to you!


          I don't want to talk. Try not
          talking. Try just listening or
          thinking for a change.


          Yeah, `cos that's working great for
          you. You're completely fine.




               Well, I've got my own fucking
               apartment.


               Oh, whopee-fucking-shit. You have
               your own apartment, that's amazing.
               Your job and an apartment, I should
               be in awe of you.


               Well, at least I'm responsible for
               it. At least I don't depend on
               people all the time. You know,
               you're a dependency, you're a
               parasite.


               You don't have anybody. You don't
               have anybody. You have me and your
               fucking pervert boss.


               You slept with that fucking pervert
               boss. So what does that make you?


               DOn't talk to me about sex-life
               Brandon. Not from you.


               Whatever.

     BRANDON makes his way to the closet, taking his coat.


               I'm going out.


               Great. And then you'll just come
               back and we'll just have this same
               fucking conversation again.


               No, you'll move out.


               And then I'll never hear from you
               again?


     BRANDON exits the apartment.




     BRANDON's reflection in the window as the train travels.



     We see that BRANDON has a nasty cut on his cheek.




     Earlier that night-

     BRANDON sits, drinks alone at the bar-

     An OLDER GUY paws a GAUNT YOUNG WOMAN plying her with drinks,
     knocking them back much to his delight.

     BRANDON watches, catching the eye of a girl  walking
     towards the bar, her friends playing pool-


               Hey-


               Hey.


     CARLY smiles, as she leans against the bar, her breasts
     spilling out of her T-shirt.


                   
               You want to get out of here?

     CARLY giggles-


               I could take you somewhere.

     CARLY looks over at her MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND just visible
     across the bar talking to a couple of GUYS.


               What? Are you with someone? Does he
               go down on you? I do..That's what I
               like to do..

     CARLY looks at him, sobering and yet-

     BRANDON's hand discreetly reaches down, up and under the
     girl's skirt, shocking her a little and yet-


               I like the way it feels. I like the
               way it's just me and it... I wanna
               taste you. I like to slip my tongue
               inside you-

     CARLY leans in closer, her lips blotting the edge of a glass
     overfilled with beer.


               ...just as you come.



CARLY hesitates, the moment hangs dangerous between them.
BRANDON sucks his fingers.


          Want me to make you come?


          I can do that. Want me to do that?

BRANDON strokes her chin-


          Hey-?

From behind, CARLY's MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND approaches, quizzical-


          What's up babe?

CARLY nods, deflects-


          I was just getting some drinks.


          Yeah, huh?


          I was just telling your pretty
          girlfriend here, that I'd like to
          fuck her in that tight pussy of
          hers.





          I mean bone her real hard til she's
          clawing up my back.


          He's kidding.

CARLY gently bars her MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND, trying to diffuse
lead him away.


          After I fuck her hard up the ass, I
          put my balls in her mouth while I
          come on her face.


           You won't let me fuck
          you in the ass.


          Christ.




               You get to fuck her in the ass?


               You know.


               Tell me more man, because you.. I'm
               fucking loving this.

     BRANDON turns, smiles provocatively, knows what's coming
     next.


               Smell it.

     The MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND reacts as BRANDON shoves his fingers
     under his nose.


                Yo!

     The MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND shoves BRANDON.


               Jesus, come on.


               You mother fucker.

     BRANDON laughs, sips his drink-




     BRANDON is rounding a corner, doing up his jacket. The
     MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND runs out after him.


               Hey, Romeo.

     He spins BRANDON around and punches him.

     The slip and slide of BRANDON's shoes, his face smashed
     against the sidewalk. The MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND comes in hard
     again, kicking him, sharp in the ribs. BRANDON recoils yet
     almost seems to want more as he struggles to stand. He spits
     on BRANDON.





     BRANDON walking, aimless and bleeding-

     The DRONE of taxi's streaking past-



     TWO WOMEN seated outside a bar, drinking and smoking, lost in
     their laughing conversation oblivious-

     BRANDON walks on-

     A YOUNG MAN with a satchel roughly brushes past him-

     The YOUNG MAN wavers on seeing BRANDON is crying, moving on-

     BRANDON's face head down wanting to get away.

     A rush of TEENAGERS and MIDDLE AGED COUPLES spilling out of a
     cinema-

     BRANDON walking, disorientated, jaywalking through the
     traffic.

     The SCREECH of horns-

     BRANDON ignores them, he crosses streets, traffic, darting
     off the sidewalk into the road, when human, dog or stroller
     gets in his way until-




     BRANDON walking past a blur of yellow Neon and glow of shop
     signs-

     Across the street, a snaking queue of MEN wait in line
     outside a club.

     He keeps walking, eyes scouring-

     TEENAGERS loiter, in oversized clothes, sunk under caps and
     hoods.




     A lively bar; a couple of HOT GIRLS entering-

     BRANDON considers, goes to enter, barred by BOUNCERS, who
     point him back along the cue-

     He stands in line-

     Across the street, a THICK SET GUY eyes him. He stands
     smoking outside a heaving bar. BRANDON looks away-

     A GANG OF GIRLS pass, The BOUNCERS let them in with ease.
     BRANDON reaches for his iPhone, tries to cover his face with
     his phone to get into the club-


               Woah! Not tonight, buddy.



     BRANDON ties to get in again. The BOUNCER stops him a second
     time.


               I said not tonight.

     The THICK SET GUY over the street, flicks out his cigarette,
     eyes grazing over BRANDON as he re-enters the heaving bar
     opposite.

     BRANDON considers, hands sunk deep in his pockets.

     Through the glass a heaving bar. BRANDON considers, on the
     edge until-

     He suddenly crosses the street, narrowly avoiding a taxi
     streaking past.




     Fluorescent light skimming the thick black darkness like a
     beam on a lighthouse-

     A heaving dance floor of BUTCH BEARS, SKINNY BOYS, and TWIGS,
     arms raised, dancing to the pulse of music.

     The THICK SET GUY, walks away, waiting for BRANDON to follow.

     BRANDON follows.




     Passing through a low hung door, BRANDON moves along a dark
     labyrinth of corridors, eyes grazing over-

     Dimly lit crevices, MEN caught briefly in light, lost in
     fellatio and stand up fucking-

     BRANDON keeps walking, drawn towards a dark doorway-




     An endless darkness, punctured with groans from dark cubicles-

     BRANDON hesitates, foot slipping on the moist floor.

     Suddenly a hand reaches out, drawing him into the dark
     cubicle-

     The THICK SET GUY presses BRANDON up against the wall,
     kissing him, tongue searching his mouth, rubbing along its
     roof, hungry and urgent.

     BRANDON pulls away, hands gently yet forcefully pushing the
     THICK SET GUY down on his knees.



     BRANDON looks beyond-

     A THIN BOY down on his knees sucking a cock through a hole
     between walls.

     BRANDON stands, legs splayed letting the THICK SET GUY take
     him in his mouth. He is beautiful.

     The palm of BRANDON's hand pressed against the side of the
     cubicle. He stands, fucking the THICK SET GUY in the mouth-

     The PULSE of music heaving, the club rocking, punctured by
     groans and grunts of rough sex from deep within.

     BRANDON throws his head back, gripping the cubicle wall.




     The early hours-

     BRANDON, heading away. He clocks his phone, several messages
     from SISSY logged.

     BRANDON listens to his voicemail-


                   
               Brandon, it's Sissy.. I really need
               to talk to you. Please.

     BRANDON pockets his phone.





               Please will you pick up the fucking
               phone?

     BRANDON stops and knocks on an apartment door. A woman opens
     and BRANDON steps in.




     A threesome. BRANDON has sex with a BLONDE and BRUNETTE.

     Throughout the images of the threesome, we hear more of
     SISSY's Voicemail.


               We're not bad people... We just
               come from a bad place.... Thanks
               for letting me stay.

     BRANDON, at climax, his animalistic grimace turns to pain and
     anguish.





      The grey snake of a subway coming up from under ground-

      BRANDON stands on a platform. It's not the rush hour yet.

      The RATTLE of the subway pulling in-

      BRANDON boards the train.




      A virtually empty car-

      BRANDON sits-

      A COLUMBIAN WOMAN across the car, head lent against the
      window, half asleep, clearly at the end of a long shift.

      Above a poster of a sunny shiny family advertising LIFE


      BRANDON's eyes graze over the poster-

      He stands his reflection mirrored back at him, preparing for
      his stop-

      The train SCREECHES to a sudden halt-

      Wheels SCREECHING along the track-

      The COLUMBIAN WOMAN wakes-

      A YOUNG STUDENT plugged headphone on, looks up from reading
      her book.

      BRANDON inwardly curses.

      The train sits in the station. Doors not opening.

      The silence at last punctured by the SHRILL hum of the
      intercom-


                Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time,
                due to a police investigation, we
                have to discharge this train.
                Please follow the conductor to the
                rear of the train.

      The long low PING of the intercom fading out-

      They wait. And wait in silence.

      BRANDON leans his head against the glass, closes his eyes, a
      hangover kicking in.



      The other few commuters in the carriage sit awkwardly,
      wondering why the doors aren't opening in the station.
      Details of the carriage appear.

      Half-drunken cup of coffee.

      An old New York POST.

      Graffiti on all the car windows.

      They wait.

      Suddenly passengers from other carriages are making their way
      through the carriage that BRANDON's in, with the CONDUCTOR
      ushering the passengers to make their way down to the end.


                   Watch your step between cars.

      Passengers asking, "What's going on?"

      BRANDON finally makes his way down with the other passengers
      to the last carriage. As he steps out, he looks down to his
      far left and sees a POLICE CAUTION LINE being unraveled, and
      ENGINEERS and FIREMEN making their way to the far front of
      the train.




      A LARGE BLACK WOMAN, face bowed, sits talking to a POLICE
      OFFICER giving a statement-


                   Watch your step.



      Several ENGINEERS stand further down the platform surrounding
      a TRAUMATISED DRIVER-


                   Follow, me please. Follow me.

      Two PLATFORM ATTENDANTS talk to POLICE OFFICERS.


                   Watch your step. This way. This
                   way. Quickly


                   This way. Nothing to see. Move on.


                   Right this way, please.


                   Move on. This way.



      BRANDON makes his way past the wrought-iron gate with other
      passengers, going up the stairwell.





      BRANDON climbs the stairs, filing out of the subway, eyes
      catching on-

      A WOMAN's shoes, like Sissy's earlier at the Boom Boom Room,
      discarded. BRANDON picks up his pace.

      The intermittent WHIR of sirens-

      BRANDON emerging from the subway, already reaching for his
      cellphone-

      Beyond the glow of an ambulance-

      BRANDON keeps walking, heading off up the road quietly
      distracted. He taps the keys pressing the cellphone to his
      ear.

      The PULSE of a distant phone ringing-

      The answer machine kicks in-


                This is Sissy..leave a message..
                Don't if you're an asshole.

      BRANDON flicks it off, slips it back in his pocket. BRANDON
      picks up his pace.

      He flicks out his phone again. Tries again-


                This is Sissy..leave a me-

      BRANDON is running now, heart beating fast now, breath
      quickening, a seeping panic threatening to unleash-


                Shit!

      SUDDENLY he makes a dash for it, weaving through the sidewalk
      at pace.




      His finger repeatedly presses the elevator button as if by
      doing so will make it arrive quicker.





      BRANDON enters into the elevator. The door shuts immediately
      behind him.





      Exiting, BRANDON heads along the faceless corridor, reaching
      his front door.

      He is already pulling out his keys and pushing them into the
      door with growing dread-




      The sound of running water from the bathroom. BRANDON stops
      with relief, leaning his forehead against the bathroom door,
      letting himself exhale-


                 Sissy-



      BRANDON hesitates, a seeping concern pricking his skin-




      BRANDON walks into the bathroom, freezing on seeing-

      SISSY sunk on the floor wedged between the bathroom and the
      toilet-

      The pump of blood seeping from her wrists, already pooled
      across the floor-

      BRANDON reaches for SISSY gripping her wrists, deep slashes
      scissoring the veins, the flap of skin, flaying-

      BRANDON pushes the fat of his thumb on each slash, blood
      seeping between his fingers-

      BRANDON looks at her wrist, every time he moves his fingers,
      he releases the pressure the blood flows.

      BRANDON grips them tighter, a quiet determination to stop the
      bleeding-

      The skid of blood underfoot, BRANDON cradles her in his arms,
      grappling with his phone, desperately calling 911.

      BRANDON desperately holds her, cradled between his legs, his
      fingers pressing her wrists, temporarily stemming the flow of
      blood, the phone wedged between shoulder and chin.



      The slip of SISSY's wrist through BRANDON's fingers. He slams
      down the phone, struggling to hold her in his grasp. She
      slips again.




      BRANDON head bowed. Sitting by Sissy's bedside-

      SISSY lies, sleeping, skin white, strapped to a drip. The
      gentle rise and fall of her breath.

      BRANDON's gaze falling on SISSY lying in the hospital bed,
      her wrists bandaged.

      BRANDON, eyes falling on the scars covering her arms. He
      reaches out a hand, on the edge of touching them, letting his
      fingers hover over them until finally-

      A FINGER lightly outlines a snaking scar seeping up her arm.
      She stirs a little but-

      SISSY's eyes just opening, focusing on him until-


                    
                Shithead.


      Relief overwhelming BRANDON, he laughs, exhales on the edge.
      BRANDON turns to stroke SISSY's hair, rests his head next to
      hers. She sleeps again.






      BRANDON now walking along the side of the river, railings
      seemingly speeding up his journey.

      Beyond, the shadowy black figures of a broken jetty stretch
      out toward the open river.




      The endless grey of the Hudson River, close now-

      BRANDON walking along a concrete jetty-

      A rusting building, oxidized and stained salt green, edging
      along the jetty until-

      BRANDON reaches the edge of the jetty, looking out-

      The LAP of grey water beneath.



      BRANDON stands, a hangover kicking in-

      And at once BRANDON is crying, the tears flowing slow at
      first until they rush, like floodgates opening. He reaches
      for breath, trying to stifle the howls emanating from his
      body, inconsolable now, flooded with emotion-

      BRANDON sinks squat to the ground, buckled in two, body
      shuddering.

      The LAP of the water steady now-

      BRANDON sobs and sobs and sobs, a mess of snot and tears as
      he looks out over the wide sweep of the Hudson River.

      Far off the drone of the freeway, the early evening trawl of
      traffic kicking in-


      The froth of the tide back and forth, rising and breaking,
      back and forth.




      BRANDON stands in his familiar spot on the platform, waiting
      for the train that will take him to work. Wearing a vacant
      face, the train pulls into the station. BRANDON boards.

      He takes a seat automatically, as if pre-programmed. The
      train leaves the platform.




      Looking into no man's land, BRANDON feels the heat of
      someone's gaze. As he instinctively looks up to respond, a
      mixture of surprise, fear, excitement and doubt across his
      face.

      The PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL who we met at the beginning of our
      story is staring down at BRANDON, this time in a more
      engaging fashion. She looks because she wants to be looked
      at.

      Again, a dance begins. This time, she leads. Engaged, active,
      decisive.

      BRANDON's face is fractured into many conflicting emotions.
      It's as if a magnet is drawing him in, but at the same time
      he's trying to resist.

      At this moment, the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL stands up, eyeing
      BRANDON as she makes her way to the door, blocking BRANDON as
      the train pulls in to her stop.





      The train pulls away from the station and disappears into the
      tunnel. We do not know if BRANDON is still aboard or has
      succumbed to his urges.
