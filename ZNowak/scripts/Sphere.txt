              based on the novel, SPHERE, by Michael Crichton




                              March 5, 1996










     Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.  Apartment
     buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.  In one building, six floors
     up, a bedroom light is on.  WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE
     looking out the window.


               What kind of a crash was it?


               You seen my suitcase?


               There's nothing on the news about a
               crash.  Did he say what airline?


               He didn't say much at all.  Honey --


               In the closet.  I don't understand,
               Norman -- why would they call you?


               Don't be so supportive, honey.


               Well, I can't imagine five years of
               unemployment --


               Four.  Four years --


               Four years of unemployment would
               look too good on a resume.


               Keep watching the news.  Are you
               watching the news?


               How are you getting to the airport?
               You need money for the bus?

     A tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front
     of the apartment building.  A U.S.  NAVY decal is on the door.


               There's a U.S.  Navy car outside,
               Norman.


               What?


               Was it a military crash?


               I don't know.


               They never used to send a Navy car.







     Blinding sunlight, as the helicopter WHIPS by, speeding above the
     Pacific Ocean.



     Norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back.  He studies a
     pamphlet in his hand: "AIRCRASH SURVIVAL: HOW TO COPE".  The PILOT, in
     the cockpit, turns to him.


               What kinda work you in, Dr. Johnson?

     Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag.


               I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am
               really, just been a while.
                    
               I treat aircrash survivors.


               Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson.


               You've heard of me?


               Well, everybody's been talking about
               that report you wrote.


               What report?


               Huh?


               What report?


               You mean you don't know?


               Know what?

     The pilot glances back at him again.


               Must be another Johnson then.  Been
               flying so many scientists out here
               -- can't keep everyone straight.


               Who's everyone?


               Physicists, mathematicians,
               geologists, you name it.


               Geologists?  At a plane crash?


               Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of
               the ocean no less.


               What the hell would a geologist be
               doing at a plane crash?

     Norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the
     water.



     The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.  A
     young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to
     greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter.

     She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag.


               Any other bags, Dr. Johnson?


               Just that.  Careful, it's heavy.

     She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem.


               No other equipment?  Scientific
               instruments?


               No, they didn't say --


               This way, sir.

     Norman follows the officer away from the helipad.



     She leads Norman down a flight of stairs.


               Captain Barnes wants to see you
               right away, sir.


               Captain who?


               Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you.
               Been calling us every half hour to
               see if you're arrived.


               Really?

     As they march down a hallway, Norman looks down at his wrinkled suit,
     tries to smooth it out.


               By the way sir, I've read your
               report.  I think it's brilliant.


               What report?


               You mean they haven't told you yet?


               Told me what?

     She staightens up, like she might have said too much.


               This way, sir.



     CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES, 60s, immaculate, proud of who he is, talks on
     the phone.


               How's he look?...  Well, we can't all
               be officers, can we?
                    
               They tell me he's brilliant.



     Norman stands in front of the door.  The doorplate reads: PROJECT
     COMMANDER -- CAPTAIN HAROLD BARNES.  Norman straightens his big-knotted
     tie.  Deep breath.



     As the door opens, Barnes is putting down the phone, rises from his
     desk, as Norman steps inside.


               Dr. Norman Johnson.  Welcome aboard.

     They shake hands.


               Thank you, Colonel.


               Captain.


               Captain.  Right, forgive me.

     Barnes looks at Norman, sizing him up.  An akward silence.


               Well, thanks for the opportuninty
               here -- my wife appreciates it.


               Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You
               weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made
               me take you.


                    
               The Pentagon?  I didn't know I had
               friends in Washington.

     Norman tries to laugh as Barnes ushers him to the door...


               Come with me.  The team's already
               waiting.


               What team?



     Barnes leads Norman down the corridor, lined with OFFICERS and GUARDS.


               What have you been told so far?


               The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers
               unknown.  Routine stuff really.


               Anything else?


               Nothing else.

     A GUARD unlocks a large, steel door.


               Captain Barnes.  Dr. Johnson.


               Hello.

     Norman looks at the guard as they proceed through the doorway,
     wondering how the guard knows his name.


               You talk to any reporters?  Any
               press?


               Press?  No, I haven't.

     The steel door shuts loudly behind them.


               Good.  Security's been our biggest
               worry.  Now that you're here we can
               shut this thing down tight.


               From what?  What's with all the
               security?


               Well, we don't have all the facts
               yet.

     Another GUARD opens up another large steel door...



     Barnes leads Norman through the room, crammed with video monitors,
     screens, and grids.  Officers talk into radios.  Technicians work on
     computers.


               We're moving fast considering the
               storm.


               Storm?  What storm?


               A cyclone's on it's way in.  I
               thought they would have told you on
               the phone.


               They didn't tell me anything.

     Norman tries to keep pace...


               We've had divers working around the
               clock.  Take a look at this...

     ANGLE ON a large VIDEO SCREEN -- shows a diver walking on the ocean
     floor, holding a bright artificial flashlight.


               How deep is he?


               A thousand feet.


               A thousand?  An airplane crashes into
               a thousand feet of water -- I don't
               want to sound pessimistic here, but
               I assume there are no survivors.


               Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.


               Then why am I here?


               What?


               What do you need me for?

     ON THE VIDEO SCREEN -- the diver shines his light on a large, metallic



               What crashed wasn't an airplane, Dr.
               Johnson.  It's a bit larger than
               that.

     Barnes walks toward a TECHNICIAN, sitting at a keyboard.


                    
               Bring up the grid, would you?

     ANGLE ON THE MONITOR as an IMAGE OF THE CRAFT begins to form.


               What is it?  A military spacecraft?
               Like a shuttle or satellite?


               Something like that.
                    
               That doesn't surprise you?


               Not really, no.  Something of the
               military crashes in the ocean -- it
               explains why there was nothing on
               the news, why you've kept everything
               a secret...  When did it crash?


               As best we can estimate, it crashed
               four hundred years ago.

     A beat.


               Four hundred?  You're kidding, right?

     ANGLE ON THE MONITOR -- showing a grid depicting an image of the craft
     and a small layer of ROCK above it.


               See this?  Coral.  Geologists measured
               the coral growth on top of the craft
               to be over five meters thick.


               Geologists?


               Coral grows at a rate of two and a
               half centimeters a year --


               -- Wait a second --


               -- dating the crash at least that
               old.


               Hold on --


               Maybe older --


               -- there's got to be some mistake
               here -- a four hundred year old
               military spacecraft?  There's no such
               thing... our space program isn't even
               forty years old.


               Extraordinary, isn't it?


               It's impossible.


               I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson...
               because it's sitting on the bottom
               of our ocean floor.



     Barnes and Norman shuffle down the stairs.


               Off the record, I don't mind telling
               you, this thing scares the shit out
               of me.


               It doesn't make any sense.


               We think it might.  That's why we
               brought you here.  We've assembled
               your team -- they're waiting for us
               now.


               What team?


               The one you recommended.  In the ULF
               report you wrote for the Bush
               administration.


               ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that
               in years.  You mean someone actually
               read it?

     As they head down a hallway, Barnes pulls the ULF REPORT out from
     under his arm, hands it to Norman.

     Norman looks at it, almost embarrassed to be holding it.


               Your report's become our bible down
               here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been
               carrying out each of your
               recommendations -- one by one -- to
               the smallest detail.


               But sir, I don't understand.  This
               report -- these recommendations...
               they're for an encounter with extra-
               terrestrial life.



     ON A VIDEO SCREEN -- sonar video of the spacecraft.


               How big is this spacecraft?


               Of what we're able to measure,
               roughly twenty-six hundred feet.


               A half a mile long?


               The wing dimension alone is larger
               that any aircraft we've seen.

     The team members sit around the conference table:

     TED FIELDING, 41, geologist, boyish and happy to be here.  BETH
     HALPERIN, 36, biochemist, mother of three who's never worn an apron.
     ARTHUR LEVINE, 54, marine biologist, pudgy and quiet.  HARRY ADAMS, 32,
     mathamatician, African-American, wire-glasses, no bullshit.


               How much damage?


               To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.


               Right.  So you're saying it survived
               a high speed impact with water
               without a scratch?


               I'm not saying anything, Harry, I'm
               just stating the facts.
                    
               The outer metal is made of a
               titanium alloy, built into an epoxy-
               resin honeycomb.  The necessary
               technology to bond this type of
               metal has never been invented.


               Never invented?

     ON NORMAN, watching the team...


               In basic English, what does all this
               mean?


               Basic English?  There's no way this
               spacecraft was constructed on our
               planet.





     A large, X-Ray APPARATUS moves to the side, revealing Norman's FACE.

     ON BETH -- standing next to him.


               Five years.  No phone calls.  What am
               I -- a leper?

     Norman sits up...


               Beth, look, can I trust you with a
               little secret?


               I love secrets.


               That ULF report everybody's patting
               me on the back about?


               I've read it twice, Norman.  It's
               brilliant.


               It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.


                    
               That's quite a secret.


               I spent a week reading Sagan and
               watching re-runs of the Twilight
               Zone.  Seriously.  I was just trying
               to pay the mortgage on my house -- I
               had no idea --

     ANGLE ON TWO NAVY CORPSMEN, standing behind glass in the next room,
     monitoring Beth and Norman.


               Do yourself a favor, Norman.  Are you
               listening?  Don't tell anyone what
               you just told me.


               C'mon, Beth -- that report's like
               the blind leading the blind.


               Because when we get down there --


               Wait -- down where?


               To the spacecraft.  To investigate.


               Underwater?


               What do you expect?  For them to
               bring it up here?


               We can't go down there.  We're not
               prepared.  That deep?  That takes
               years of training, Beth.  We're just
               scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear
               ties and lab coats to work -- not
               oxygen tanks.


               Well, you must have realized the
               chances an encounter like this would
               happen here.  In the ocean.
                    
               70 percent of the earth's surface is
               water, Norman.  That's first grade
               geography.


               It never occurred to me.


               Well, let's pray that's the only
               mistake you made.  Have you said
               anything to Barnes about this?


               The timing has never seemed quite
               right.


               Just keep your mouth shut, alright?
               This could mean everything to our
               careers, you know that?  Don't
               jeopardize this.


                    
               What -- are you threatening me?



     THE SKY -- clouds looming on the horizon.

     ANGLE ON ARTHUR LEVINE, leaning against the railing, looking out at
     the water.

     ON NORMAN, approaching him.  Arthur never looks at Norman, he just
     stares out at the water.


               I don't know you, but I'll be honest
               with you.  I don't like this.  I don't
               like any of this.  Especially, the
               water.


               Seasick?  A marine biologist?


               I don't belong here.  None of us
               belong here.  Look at that.

     ANGLE ON THE WATER, an ocean of seemingly endless, choppy waves.


               Makes you feel pretty small, doesn't
               it?


               It scares the shit out of me.



     CLOSE ON NORMAN, lying on a cot.  It is dark.  His eyes are open.  He
     stares at the ceiling.





     A porthole hatch to the DESCENT SUB unlatches loudly.  A SUB-OFFICER
     help Norman lower himself through the hatch.



     Norman steps down the ladder into the sub compartment.  Seated in a
     circle area: Ted, Beth, Harry, and Arthur.  Ahead of them, Captain
     Barnes sits with the pilot in the sub's cockpit, separated by a wall
     of plexiglass.

     Norman takes a seat between Beth and Ted.


                    
               Our descent will take 13 minutes.
               Descending at a speed of 80 feet per
               minute.

     Across from Norman, Harry is WHISPERING something quietly into
     Arthur's ear.


               Pressure adjustments will cause the
               sub to lurch at times, but don't be
               alarmed.  It's perfectly normal...

     Arthur's face drips with sweat, as Harry continues to whisper into his
     ear.


               The sub's interior atmosphere will
               experience moisture as we descend,
               and the temperature will drop
               rapidly.  Just relax and remain
               seated during the descent.

     Norman watches Arthur, dripping with sweat.


               We have clearing from the base.

     Red interior lights flicker on in the compartment, and WE HEAR the sub
     make a HISSING sound.  The sub lurches, and begins to lower in the
     water.


               Arthur?

     Harry has gotten to Arthur.  Arthur is on the verge of panic.


               Arthur?  You alright?


               Open the hatch door, please.

     Harry continues to whisper in his ear.


               Captain, open the hatch door, please
               ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it,
               please.


               Calm down, Dr. Levine.


               Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!


               Please, Dr. Levine.

     Arthur leaps violently out of his seat, scrambles to the plexiglass
     wall.


                    
               Sit down, Dr. Levine!  You're in a
               military operation now --

     Arthur bangs on the plexiglass wall with his fists.


               ... Your civil rights have been
               overridden!


               Open it, Captain!


               Dr. Levine, please!  Return to your
               seat!

     Arthur VOMITS, violently, heaving, splattering the plexiglass wall.


               Open the fucking door!

     The sub LURCHES again, coming to a stop.  The compartment is totally
     silent, as they begin ascending to the surface.

     ON HARRY smiling a sly, evil grin directed right at Norman.

     The sub lurches again, and WE HEAR clanking metal.  The hatch door
     opens.

     And Arthur, wiping the vomit from his mouth, climbs up the ladder and
     out the hatch door.


               Anybody else?

     Silence.

     The hatch door LOCKS, loudly.  The sub lurches, and begins descending.


               Pussy.


               What's that -- mistake number two,
               Norman?


               He wasn't feeling well.


               He's a pussy.

     Harry is still staring at Norman...


               How are you feeling, Norman?


               What?


               You holding up alright?


               Fine.  I'm fine.


               Don't be defensive.


               I'm not being defensive.


               You sound defensive.


               I'm fine.


                    
               What'd you say to him?


               To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing
               that Norman doesn't already know.


               What does Norman already know?


               Norman thinks we shouldn't be going
               down.  Thinks it's a mistake.

     Norman looks over at Beth.


               She told me what you said, Norman.


               What is it, Harry?


               Just one of Norman's many secrets.

     ON NORMAN, saying nothing.



     WE SEE the sub descending into darker waters.



     The SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal.  Around
     it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights.



     CLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking.


               One moment for pressurizing.



     ANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the
     small, claustrophobic pressurizing room.  Like sardines.  Nobody says
     anything.  A long beat.



     in front of them, opens.  TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, a big-boned female
     officer, stands before them.  She wears a black plastic PAD, a
     "talker", around her neck.

     She hands each member their own "talker".  Norman takes his.



     Fletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway.  Each of
     them wears the "talkers" around their necks.


               They pressurize us with helium.


               What's wrong with oxygen?


               It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it
               makes a half-eaten apple turn brown
               and puts the ugly, iron rust on an
               Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low,
               oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it
               down here, and it'll do to your dick
               what it does to the Oldsmobile.


               Important safety tip.  Thanks
               Captain.

     Fletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to Barnes...


               Captain, the divers have the airlock
               mounted at the door.  The robot is
               now in position to enter the
               spacecraft.


               Robot?  What robot?



     CLOSE ON A MONITOR -- showing the robot in front of the curved gray
     metal of the spacecraft.


               Edmunds, bring up the robot's camera
               feed.

     JANE EDMUNDS, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel.  Another
     MONITOR clicks on -- showing the robot's POV of the door.


               Captain, you know, I really
               appreciate you hauling us a thousand
               feet below sea level so we can watch
               this historical event on television.


               Nobody goes inside, until we know
                inside.

     ON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans the spacecraft hull, stops on
     a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door.


               Can you open that panel?


               Working on it now, sir.

     ON THE MONITOR -- a robotic CLAW extends out to the panel.  Trying to
     pry the panel open.


               I'd like it noted in the report that
               I think we should be doing this
               ourselves.  Making a manned entry...

     The claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal.


               I'd also like it noted --


               Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using
               suction.

     ON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber
     sucker.  It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck.


               It's not sucking, sir.


               Thank you, I can see that.  Try
               something else.


               We don't have anything else to try,
               Sir.


               Well, shit -- find something, do
               something... make something up --


               What about a crowbar?

     Barnes straightens up, looks at Ted...


               What  a crowbar?


               What if we go out there, you know --
               wedge a crowbar in the door and pry
               the thing open.


               Pry the thing open?  What are we --
               neanderthals?


               All that banging and pounding.  I
               don't know.  We should think about
               making a good first impression.


               For who?  The fish?


               For whoever's in that thing.


               Or whatever's in that thing.

     ON THE MONITOR -- the spacecraft, sitting there silently, staring back
     at them.


               Norman, what do you think?

     Norman, quiet in the corner, perks up...


               Me?  Well -- I don't really...  I
               mean, you could... you know, you
               could make a real solid case... a
               crowbar?

     All eyes on Norman.


               I don't know.

     A beat as they all stare at him.


               I'm secure enough with that.



     ANGLE ON A LOCKER door opening.  Inside is an elaborate JUMPSUIT and
     HELMET with the name: "JOHNSON", stenciled above the faceplate.


               Are we all -- I mean, is it
               necessary for all of us to go... out
               there?

     The other team members take their suits out of their lockers.


               Nothing to be nervous about.  These
               suits are wired and electrically
               heated.  Each equipped with an alarm
               that triggers automatically if life-
               support sustems go below optimum.

     Norman holds his jumpsuit out and away from him, like it's something
     nuclear.


               It's just like swimming, Norman...
               You know how to swim, don't you?


               You're not afraid of the water, are
               you, Norman?

     They all look over at him.


                    
               Isn't there a psychological term for
               that, Dr. Johnson?


                    
               Yeah.  Drowning.



     Dressed in jumpsuits and helmets -- Barnes jumps into a POOL of ocean
     water, cut out from the floor, leading to the ocean.  It looks like a
     tiny swimming pool.  Ted jumps in next.  Beth, Harry, and Norman are
     left...


               You're next, Norman.


                    
               No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.


               Such a gentlemen when you're scared
               shitless.

     She hops in.  Norman watches, looks up at Harry, next to him.


               Go ahead.  Ladies first.


               No, why don't --

     Harry nudges him forward.


               C'mon.


               Wait a second, I --

     Harry pushes him again.  Norman catches himself.


               Geez, c'mon, alright.  Gimme a
               minute.  Let me get my bearings --

     Harry pushes him again.


               C'mon, Norman.


               Look, would you --

     And Harry just pushes him in.  Norman slips and falls awkwardly... into
     the ocean depths.





     Quiet.  Only THE SOUND OF NORMAN -- BREATHING.

     For a couple beats.

     Now... NORMAN'S POV -- from inside his helmet -- a light SHINES from
     behind him -- casting his SHADOW onto the murky ocean floor.

     Norman's head turns, and he's BLINDED by a light -- it's Harry, the
     light SHINING from the top of Harry's helmet.

     WE HEAR Harry's voice, static, through Norman's helmet.


               The switch is on your waist.

     ON NORMAN -- his GLOVE -- fumbling at his waist.

     HIS HELMET LIGHT -- FLICKERS on.

     ON NORMAN -- slowly, beginning to walk on the ocean floor.

     HIS FEET -- squashing gently, lightly into the muddy ground.

     NORMAN'S POV -- can barely make out the others in front of him, their
     helmet lights STROBING the dark water, crossing each other, like
     searchlights on a foggy night.

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE -- eyes cold, BREATHING.  Couple beats.  And



               Look at that thing.

     Norman's eyes look up... WE PULL BACK...

     LONG, HIGH, WIDE SHOT of the team -- their little helmet lights tiny
     and insignificant almost as...

     IN FRONT OF THEM -- the SPACECRAFT.  Dwarfing them in size, looming
     large, majestic, like nothing we've ever seen.  The enormous tail fin,
     in the distance, extends high out of the coral.

     In the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft, WE SEE a tunnel --
     cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs.



     About 60 feet deep.  Narrower than they'd like.  Norman descends,
     clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to
     the coral walls.





     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE as he watches the water recede, down past his
     faceplate.



     Ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a
     sledgehammer.


               Easy Ted, we're not mining gold.


               Gimme some room here, will you?  Back
               off.  Gimme some space.

     They all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted
     keeps swinging.


               Looks alot like an airplane door,
               doesn't it?

     Ted stops and looks at the door.


               Alot like.  You know, I noticed it
               before, but I didn't...


               Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit.
               Keep hammering.


               You want me to try?


               You're a 53 year old shrink, what
               are you gonna do?


               Give him the hammer, Ted.

     Norman takes the hammer.  Walks up to the wedge.  Gets his bearings.
     Rears back... then stops.


               What is it, your back give out?

     Something has caught Norman's eye.  He looks down at the wedge.


               What is it, Norman?


               Take a look.

     Barnes comes toward him.  The others follow.  Barnes bends down, looks
     closely down at the wedge in the door.


               It's chipped.


               Chipped?  The door?  How can it be
               chipped?


               I don't know how it can be chipped,
               but it's chipped.


               I thought you said there wasn't any
               damage done in the crash?


               I did.


               Then how can it be chipped?

     ON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms, feels around.


               There's heat coming the door.


               Back away then.


               Wait a minute --


               I said back away.


               Would you wait a minute?



     Barnes unstraps a GUN -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his
     buckle.


               Ted, get her away from the door.


               What are you going to do -- shoot
               her?

     The RUMBLING louder...


               Get her away!

     THE DOOR begins to slide open.

     Beth backs away.

     THE DOOR, sliding, is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside.  The door
     stops, it's open, it's quiet.  They all stand there, looking at
     BLACKNESS.  A long beat.



     ON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside.  His helmet light SHINES on the
     others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK, suspended
     high in the air.

     Metallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them.

     Norman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40 feet of
     darkness, dimly lighting the LOWER HULL, a dense network of STRUTS and



               Look at this.


               What is it?

     Ted SPOTLIGHTS the OUTER HULL.


               Some sort of lead or something.


               Radiation shield, you think?


               A foot and a half thick?  That'd
               withstand a helluva lot of
               radiation.

     Beth's light SHINES down onto the CATWALK.  WE SEE FOOTPRINTS outlined
     on the dusty floor.


               Hold on --


               What is it?


               Any of you get ahead of me -- walk
               this far up?


               No.  I don't think so.


               Well, think.  Because there's
               footprints here that aren't mine.


               Well, they're not mine.

     ON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large, like the boots they're wearing.


               Calm down, alright?  They gotta be
               somebody's here.  Let's stay
               together, please.



     LONG SHOT -- seeing them suspended high in the air on the catwalk,
     walking.  Their tiny streams of LIGHT moving about.  WE SEE just how
     ominous this spacecraft really is.


               It's empty.  Why would someone build a
               ship like this?


               You'd have to ask them.

     They approach a DOOR, at the end of the catwalk.


               Alright, Beth, do that thing you did
               before.


               How about I just press the button?

     She presses a button near the door.  The door SLIDES open.


               Or just... press the button.

     Barnes holds out his gun, and enters.  The others behind him.


               Strange, isn't it?  You know -- how
               it would have a button.


               Earth doesn't have a patent on
               buttons, Ted.


               Still, make a note I recognized that.

     ON BARNES -- leading them through a small hall.  It seems to be opening
     up into some sort of room -- when Barnes stops.  Dead in his tracks.


               What's wrong?


                    
               What do you make of this?

     ON NORMAN -- as he steps around Barnes, his light BRIGHTENING on: A
     SIGN that reads: "Trash."


                    
               What the hell?

     Very softly, Harry begins to laugh.


               English?


               That's right.

     Norman looks up and SEES more of the room as his light SHINES
     throughout it: TABLES, COUCHES and CHAIRS -- made of leather, very
     comfortable looking.

     They begin to slowly wander about... 


               I don't get it.


               It doesn't make any sense.


               You don't think it does?  I think
               it's rather obvious.


               Is it some sort of joke?  Like one of
               those hoaxes?


               A spacecraft half a mile long --
               with 500 tonnes of coral on top of
               it?  Someone went to a lot of
               trouble.  Try again.


               But it's impossible.


               Is it?

     Beth touches the table, it's metal, but it's soft and rubbery.


               Why would this ship carry
               instructions in English?


               Think about it.


               Unless, this alien spacecraft was --
               you know -- somehow presenting
               itself to Americans in a way that
               would make us feel comfortable.


               400 years ago?  I'm sure Christopher
               Columbus would've loved these
               accomodations.


               Good theory, Ted.


               Well, what's your theory?


               I'm a woman.  I don't theorize.  I
               only deal with facts.


               All the facts you need are right in
               front of you.


               Gimme a minute here... I think I've
               got it.


               Do you?


               If it is an alien spacecraft --


               Save your breath.  It's not an alien
               spacecraft.


               Then what is it?


                    
               It's an American spacecraft.


               An American spacecraft?  Half a mile
               long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah,
               good theory, Harry.


               It's been obvious from the start,
               hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all
               the secrecy, why no one was told
               about it?


               We had considered it.


               Considered what?  That it's American?
               How would you think it's American?


               The chip in the door.

     ON NORMAN -- glancing up at Harry... 


               We take a weeny little wedge, bang
               on it a couple of times, and bust
               off a chunk of the metal.  Yet any
               spacecraft -- even at a low
               velocity, say 200 miles an hour --
               crashes into the water -- it's gonna
               be like hitting concrete, it would
               crumple like paper.  But there isn't
               a dent to be seen anywhere.  Not even
               a scratch.


               Meaning?


               Meaning it didn't land in the water.


               Please.  It must have flown here --


               It didn't fly here.  It  here.


               Arrived?  From where?


               Not where.  When.  400 years ago.  From
               our future.

     A quiet moment as they take this in.



     Ted and Barnes trek through a vast cargo bay, like two ants wlth
     flashlights.


               Time travel.  I always thought it was
               one of those myths... like Santa's
               reindeer.


               What would we be working on in the
               future that would make us want to
               come back?


               Maybe we didn't want to come back.



     Norman, Harry, and Beth... 


               What are you looking for?


               A light switch.  A button opened that
               door -- the craft runs on some sort
               of power.

     ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS.


               What's that noise?

     They LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE.


               Sounds a little like water --

     SUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him
     inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him
     -- sucking him inside... 


               Norman!


               Get this thing off me.

     Beth bends down, presses a button, the CHAIR releases Norman... 


               I think the chair thinks you want to
               fly this thing.

     ON BETH's FACEPLATE -- as she's looking down -- WE BEGIN TO SEE --
     reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering
     across... 



     Her EYES look up slowly... as we



     THE BLACK SCREEN in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow
     lettering:

     "RV -- LHOOQ -- DCOMl -- U.S.S STAR VOYAGER"

     "ASSIMILATING DATABASE" as a series of numbers race upwards in
     count... 

     And the desk in front of them LIGHTS UP, a control panel coming to
     life.  


               Nice work, Norman.


               Whatever I can do to help.

     ON THE SCREEN as it changes, now filled with columns:






     Harry punches some keys on the control panel.


               A flight recorder.  Our future is
               about to be seen in our present.

     ON THE SCREEN as it changes:










               01-01-47.  Two thousand-forty seven.
               50 years in our future.


               Unknown Entry Event.

     Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys... 

     ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving... 
     WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the
     room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the
     illusion of depth.

     The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like
     we're flying through it.

     The stars and other space matter streaking by.


               What's that cluster of stars there?
               In the center?

     Harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image... 


               Our answer.


               To what?


               Time travel.  A black hole.

     The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer
     and closer, brightening.

     The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as
     WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole.

     ON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS:


               Ted?  Captain?


               Yes, Harry.


               We know how this craft got here.
               Where it's been.


               So do we.  And it seems to have
               picked up something on it's travels.

     STILL ON NORMAN -- frightened... 


               Picked up something?  What is it?


               I don't know.  But it's something
               alien.





     ANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance.  AS WE PAN UP
     and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly
     swirling green and blue fluids.  Like mercury.  Mesmerizlng.

     AS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in
     dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top.

     They walk around it, circling it, looking up at it.


               This answers one of our questions.


               Which one?  Let me get the list out.


               This spacecraft was designed to pick
               things up.  They see things they want
               -- these claws go out and bring it
               in.  They come across this.  This... 
               .  Find it interesting,
               curious.  They draw it inside to take
               back home.


               But on the way home, they miss their
               turn, go too far, into the past.


               Our present.


               But what does it do?  This... sphere.


               Maybe it's a message of some sort,
               you know?  See this red here.

     ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- some dark red MARKINGS on it's surface... 


                    
               Looks like a design, some writing,
               maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the
               spacecraft with a message.


               Look closely.  That isn't writing.
               Those are grooves.

     ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved into the surface.


               No.  They don't represent a message.
               They aren't decorative at all.  They
               have another purpose entirely.


               What?


               To conceal a small break in the
               surface of the sphere.


               A break for what?



     DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR -- WE SEE Barnes, through a half-closed door,
     pacing, talking on the phone... 


               ... it's definitely something alien
               ... another civilization, yes, sir... 
               Well, we don't know yet, but we
               think we've found a door... 



     Edmunds, Barnes, and the team members  look at the monitor.


               So how do we get it open?


               Ted seems to have some ideas.

     ON THE MONITOR -- Ted pushing on the SPHERE door.  Banging into it with
     his shoulder.


               Maybe we shouldn't.


               What?


               If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't
               try to open it at all.


                    
               Man is man, all he knows is man, and
               all he can think of is what he
               knows.  The anthropomorphic problem.
               Good, Norman.


               The what?


               I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't
               you read the report?


               Everything ever written about extra-
               terrestial life imagines that life
               is essentially human.  If it doesn't
               look human, it's a reptile or a big
               insect or something, having human
               values, human understanding.


               So?  What's the problem?


               It's nonsense.  There's enough
               difference between our own species
               to prove that.


               Take politics, our views on
               abortion, the death penalty... 


               Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now
               we're talking about a new life form.
               Their values and ethics may be
               incomprehensible.


               Like "Thou shall not kill"?


               Or maybe, it can't  killed.


               You mean, what's in that thing is
               immortal?


               I don't know.  That's the point.


               Everything can be killed.


               Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take
               ... yeasts.


               Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't
               think we're gonna open it up and
               find a loaf of bread.


               And we're just talking about three-
               dimensional creatures.  What if it's
               five or six or seven-dimensional?  So
               dimensional that we couldn't even
               see it to kill it.


               Good point.  I don't know what you're
               talking about, but good point.


               Or it could contain some great
               benefit to us, some astonishing new
               idea or technology to help mankind.


               It could.  But the odds of it being
               any use to us are against it.


               You don't know that.


               Let's say whoever made this thing is
               a thousand years ahead of us, just
               like we are to, say, medieval
               Europe.  Suppose you went back to
               medieval Europe with a TV set.  There
               wouldn't be any place to plug it in.


               Just tell me worst case.  Worst case
               of what we might find?


               It could breathe in air and exhale
               cyanide gas.


               Disrupt our brain waves, interfere
               with our ability to think.


               Produce radioactive waste and
               disintegrate us into nothing.



     CLOSE ON PRINTER, TYPING: "Surface winds at 25 knots -- Estimated Time
     of Departure -- 01:45 hrs"





     Empty, sterile.  WE HEAR the repeating sound: THWAP.  Almost like a
     dripping faucet.  THWAP... THWAP... 



     Harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his middle finger at
     his cheek: THWAP... THWAP.


               You realize, Norman, that we are all
               going to die.

     Norman is lying in his own bunk, below Harry.


               Don't be so optomistic, Harry.


               I'm completely serious.  There is
               something very important missing
               from that spacecraft.  You know what
               that is?


               Not a clue.


               A sign that the builders knew time
               travel through a black hole was
               possible.


               I don't follow you.


               On that flight recorder, they called
               the black hole an "Unknown Entry
               Event." They didn't know what a
               black hole was.  Fifty years from
               now, men are going to build that
               ship in a very tentative,
               experimental way, with no knowledge
               that time travel through a black
               hole is possible.


               So what?

     Harry leans his head over his bunk.


               So, .
                    
               We know it went through a black
               hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd
               get to the surface, we'd tell
               someone about the black hole,
               wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report
               like some big discovery.  So in fifty
               years when they build that ship,
               they'd make precautions for a black
               hole.
                    
               .  The called it an
               Unknown Entry Event.


               Meaning we're never gonna get the
               chance to tell anyone.


               Meaning we're never gonna get to the
               surface alive... to tell anyone.

     Norman gets out of his bed.


               I can't believe that, Harry.


               Gimme another explanation.

     Norman pacing.


               I can't.  If I had a minute to think,
               maybe, but I know you're wrong.


               Am I?


               Look -- we're under a lot of
               pressure, we're tired, you're not
               thinking straight.


               You mean, you think I'm cracking?


               No.  I didn't say that.


               Then what, Norman?

     Norman stops pacing, a beat.


               It's what's in that sphere, isn't
               it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in
               that thing -- you think it's going
               to kill you.


               Curious, isn't it?  What's inside?
               Before I die, I'd sure like to open
               it and see.



     CLOSE ON MONITOR: Video of the sphere.  RAPIDLY rewinding.


               What caused it?


               Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything
               was normal.  No changes at all.


               When did it happen?


               Seconds ago.  Here!

     PLAYBACK: WE SEE the sphere -- idle.  Nothing around it.  Then it's DOOR
     slowly OPENS, revealing BLACKNESS inside.  A beat.  And then it closes.


               Let me see that again.

     Edmunds plays it again.  This time... 

     WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, staring at the monitor.


                    
               I'd sure like to open it and see.

     ON HARRY -- those cold, intelligent eyes.



     CLOSE ON PRINTER, TYPING: "... 30 knots -- ETD -- 00:19 min"





     CLOSE ON -- Norman and Barnes.


               Don't get hysterical, Norman.


               I'm telling you, Harry's lost it.
               He's saying there's a deathwish out
               for each of us.


               Look, the ships are clearing out.
               They're taking us topside in a
               matter of minutes.  Someone can check
               him out there, if it's that imprtant.


               All I'm saying is, someone should
               keep an eye on him.


               Just worry about yourself.



     Barnes on the phone with the surface.  Ted talking to him anyway... 


               Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk
               it.  I am.  After what we just
               witnessed.


                    
               What?  No, I know they're
               civilians... 



     ON NORMAN -- gathering his things.  Stuffing his shotty dufflebag.

     Beth, at her bunk, doing the same.

     Norman stands up.  Looks at the bunk above him: unpacked clothes,
     unpacked belongings, a notebook lying there saying: PROPERTY OF DR.


     ON NORMAN -- panicking, looking around for Harry.






                    
               ... I said send the subs down, damn
               it!

     Barnes out the door, Ted at his heels... 


               Did you hear me, sir, because --


               Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready
               to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now!

     ON NORMAN -- running at them... 


               Harry's missing.


               What do you mean, he's missing?


               He's missing.  He's gone.  He left.


               He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The
               sub's on it's way.
                    
               Go!  C'mon!

     Norman runs off.  Barnes storms down the hall... 


               How can he be missing?


               Sir, about leaving --


               We're on the bottom of the fucking
               ocean -- he can't just walk outside!



     Edmunds working the monitors, stops.  Seeing something on a screen.
     Staring in horror... 


                    
               Oh my gosh... 



     Barnes, phone to his ear... 


               Gimme a report, I want --


               Ladies and Gentlemen... 


               Who is that?  Where's that coming
               from?


               Please watch your closest monitor... 

     Barnes turns... 

     ON HIS MONITOR -- Harry, in jumpsuit and helmet, stands in front of the


     Barnes quickly puts on his headset mic... 


               What's he doing there?



     Edmunds, Norman, Beth, Ted staring at the monitor... 


               I thought he was with you, Norman.

     Through the speakers... 


               Get him out of there.  I thought I
               told you people --


                    
               Harry?  Can you copy?

     ON THE MONITOR -- Harry, before the SPHERE... 


               Pay close attention.  I think you
               will find this of interest.

     The sphere DOOR slowly opens.


               What the hell is he doing?

     Harry steps up and into the sphere.  The door closes slowly behind him.



     PRINTER, TYPING: "... ETD -- 00:15 min"





     Norman with Barnes... 


               Don't tell me I told you so, Norman,
               because I don't want to hear it.
                    
               Ted, I want everything by the door
               -- ready to go!



     ON MONITOR -- labled: "SUB DESCENT" -- it's still.


                    
               Subs are still at surface, sir.




                    
               Send them, damn it!  I know, but I'm
               not gonna be held responsible --

     Norman with him... 


               You can't just leave Harry down
               here, sir.


               I told you people, nobody goes
               anywhere unless I say.


               But sir --


               No "buts".  If he wants to be left,
               we'll leave him.
                    
               Hello?  Yes, the subs -- I want a
               report...  Hello...  Yes, a report.
               Gimme... shit.


               I'm getting no sub reading, sir.


               They're coming.



     PRINTER, TYPING: "... ETD -- 00:13 min"





     ON NORMAN -- staring at the monitor of the sphere, idle.


               Any sign of Harry?


               Nothing, sir.




               Fuck him.
                    
               What?  Hello?



     ON MONITOR -- labeled "SUB DESCENT"... 


               Sir, I am still getting absolutely
               no reading on sub movement...

     Beth, inside now... 


               I am not leaving without him.  Do you
               hear me?  We come down as a team, we
               leave as a team.


               What are you -- his mother?  Get
               Norman, I want everyone ready to go.
                    
               Edmunds, the subs?


               Nothing, sir.


               What the hell is going on here?



     Beth rushes by Ted, carrying bags to the door... 


               Norman?  Where's Norman?


               By the bunks.



     Beth running in... 


               Norman?... Norman?

     Can't see him anywhere.




               Norman!




               Edmunds, do you have a 20 on Norman?


               Yes, sir.


               Well, where the fuck is he?


               In the ship, sir.

     Barnes spins to see the monitor... 


               What?

     ON MONITOR -- Norman, in jumpsuit and helmet, running through the ship.

     Barnes slipping on headset mic... 


               Norman?  Norman!



     Norman running across a catwalk... 


               You get your ass back here.  You have
               no authority whatsoever to be in
               there.  You hear me?...  Norman?  Don't
               go hero on me now.



     PRINTER, TYPING: "... ETD -- 00:05 min EVACUATION IMMINENT"




               Sir, if the subs haven't left by
               now... 


               They've left, keep watching!


               Sir!  Sir, the door -- it's opening.

     ON THE MONITOR -- the sphere door, slowly opening.  Revealing:



               Where is he?  Damn it!  Can you see
               him?

     A still moment and then Harry tumbles out the sphere, and falls to the
     ground.



     Barnes, squinting at Harry on his monitor.


               How does he look?  Can you tell?

     Harry lies motionless.


               He looks... dead, sir.

     ON BETH -- in the hall, hearing that.



     Norman, running, blindly, through a hall, around corners... 


               Norman, get out of there now!
               Norman?




               If the subs aren't here yet, sir --



     Barnes, into his headset.


               They'll be here.  Norman -- can you
               hear me?... 



     ON NORMAN -- running... 


               You don't have time!  Get the hell
               out of --

     Barnes' voice goes static, and cuts out.



     ON THE MONITOR -- flickering, losing power... 


               Sir, we're losing it.

     ON THE MONITOR -- flickering, fading, and all the lights and monitors




     ON HARRY -- lying still, face down under the sphere.  Goes to him.
     Checks Harry's LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  Still blinking -- he's still alive.
     Norman, pauses, looks up, staring at... 



     Mesmerizing.  He can see himself, reflected in the swirling mass,
     staring back at himself.  The door begins to open, closes.  Begins to
     open.



     Dark.  Ted, Beth, and Barnes wander throughout.


               What the hell happened?

     The lights flicker back on.


               They switched us over.


               To what?


               Internal power.


               What for?



     THE OCEAN FLOOR -- a cable falling from the surface, coiling around and
     around.



     ANGLE ON their dufflebags piled in the corner by the door.  They've
     been left behind.



     LOOKING DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR -- it's quiet.  WE PEEK inside the
     cafeteria... 


               The surface ships will be back.
               After the storm clears.


               How long will that be?



     Barnes speaks to the team ... 


               They told me about sixty hours.


               Two and a half days?


               How long can we last down here?


               Comfortably?  Seventy-two hours.


               Comfortably -- what's that mean --
               with oxygen?







     Harry lies on his bunk.  He begins to slowly awake.

     WE BEGIN TO HEAR A SCRATCHING NOISE, like nails on a chalkboard.  It
     gets LOUDER as Harry comes to.  He puts his fingers to his temples.

     Norman stands beside, him writing in his notebook.


               What is that?  That noise?


               What noise?


               It's like... 

     ANGLE ON Norman's pen -- as he stops writing, the NOISE stops.

     Harry sighs.  Norman looks down at his pen.


               Harry, can you tell me about the
               sphere?


               What are you still doing here?


               You remember opening the door?


               You were all supposed to leave.  You
               weren't supposed to stay down here.


               Tell me about the door.  Do you
               remember how you opened the door to
               the sphere?... Harry?


               You don't understand about the
               sphere.


               Then explain it to me.

     Harry pauses, staring almost like a frightened little boy.


               Norman?


               What is it, Harry?


               What happens on page 87?  Have you
               ever read page 87?


               Page 87 of what, Harry?


               I could never read that far.  I never
               wanted to.


               That far in what, Harry?

     Harry doesn't say anything.  Norman waiting... 


               You shouldn't be here, Norman.  It's
               too dangerous for you and the others
               to be down here.



     Beth comes out from behind a vinyl shower curtain.  A towel wrapped
     around her.


               Beth -- I wanted to have a word with
               you... 

     Barnes washes his hands at the sink, looking at her in the mirror in
     front of him.


               Back at the door -- I asked you to
               back away.


               Yeah.  I heard you.


               There are procedures, Beth, that I
               want followed.  My procedures.  And
               considering what's going on, I want
               you to follow them very closely.


                    
               Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy
               manual.  I wonder what it says about
               bathroom and shower procedures.

     He walks to the door, then turns.


               And Beth, one other thing.  I'd like
               from now on for you to address me as
               Captain or sir in front of the men.



     A LONG CORRIDOR -- LOOKING into the cafeteria... 



     Harry is eating at a table, seems more relaxed.  The team members
     around him, eating too.  Beth, cold.  Harry sprinkles salt on the dish
     of food in the middle.


               Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya?
               We're not a bunch of icy streets
               here.


               Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you
               from getting impotent.


               Impotent?  I'm not impotent.


                    
               These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You
               might have a second career coming.


               What are they?


               Squid... 

     Harry stops mid-chew.  Frightened.


               ... there was a whole flock of them
               out there earlier.  It's strange.
               It's dead down here, and then all of
               a sudden --

     Harry drops his fork.  He begins COUGHING.  HACKING.  CHOKING loudly.
     GAGGING.  He HACKS out the squid from his mouth... 





     A long, empty corridor.  All is quiet.



     CLOSE ON A MONITOR -- a series of numbers:









               When did it come across?


               Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to
               decode it in his room now.


               Where's it coming from?


               No idea.  We have no surface support.
               It transmitted too fast to be coming
               from underwater.


               Is it coming from our own computer?


               Harry thinks it's some sort of
               discharge from our own system, but
               I've seen it discharge before -- and
               it didn't look anything like this.



     SWARMS of pretty, pink JELLYFISH.  Everywhere.

     FROM UNDER THE HABITAT -- Fletcher swims up to them with a net.  It's
     beautiful.  Eerie.  Almost idyllic.



     Harry, on his bunk with decoding papers in his hands, turns to Norman,
     entering the room.


               Getting anywhere with those?


               There's some sort of pattern here.
               It'll take a minute.


               Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish.
               Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.
                    
               Harry, what happened in the
               cafeteria?


               Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze
               me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like
               you hate jellyfish.


               You said something to me, before --
               about how we were all going to die.


               Did I?


               You don't remember that?


               I don't remember much.  It's like my
               memory is on the tip of my tongue --
               but I can't taste any of it.  Funny,
               my senses are much keener though.
               Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling.
               Like, I can smell your sheets,
               Norman.  You tried to wash it out
               earlier, But I can still smell the
               urine.
                    
               Don't worry, I'm not going to tell
               the others.  It's normal, really,
               isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress.
               The panic.



     Beth, Ted, and Barnes watch... 

     ON A MONITOR -- Fletcher outside, with the jellyfish.


                    
               Fletcher?  What are you doing out
               there?


               They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.


               She says jellyfish are a delicacy.
               You know, I never knew that.


               Get out of there.  I don't want anyone
               going anywhere outside, understood?


               They're warm.  I can feel the heat on
               my legs.


               Fletcher, I want you back here.





     Norman sitting on the table... 


               What happened to you inside that
               sphere, Harry?

     A long beat.  Harry becomes concerned... 


               Why?  Does someone else want to go
               inside?





     ON THE MONITOR -- Fletcher, the jellyfish clinging to her facemask, her
     suit... 


               I can't see, they're smearing the
               faceplate.  My arms... the fabric... 

     Fletcher's suit tears... 


               Fletcher, get away from there... 


               It's burning... 


               Get out of there!


               I can't see... 


               Fletcher!  Now!


               I can't... 

     ON BETH -- bolting out of the room.  Barnes turning to her... 


               Nobody move.


               But she's --


               Nobody move!


               They're eating through... 
               Somebody --



     ON FLETCHER -- UNDERWATER -- jellyfish eating into her plastic
     faceplate... she's COUGHING, GASPING.



     They watch... 

     ON THE MONITOR -- Her body twisting, contorting.  Her suit, ripping
     apart.  SCREAMING.  She convulses.  Her body falling.





     CLOSE ON -- Fletcher's face.  Cold, dead.  Eyes open.  Jellyfish rooted in
     her skin.





     CLOSE ON A MICROSCOPIC IMAGE of a jellyfish.

     ON NORMAN -- in the corner of the lab, inspecting a MEDICAL KIT.


               What is this, Beth?  You taking
               valium?

     Beth, looking into the microscope.


               Sedatives.  Whatever my mood calls
               for.

     Norman picks up a book, next to the kit: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.


               Where'd this come from?


               The library.


               We have a library?


               A bad one.  It was the only book in
               there.  Norman, come here, look at
               this.


               No, thank you.  I hate jellyfish.

     Walking toward her... 


               ... when I was six, my younger
               brother and I -- we went swimming in
               the Pacific.  At my mother's beach
               house.  We both felt stinging, and
               when we came out of the water, he
               was wearing jellyfish head to toe.
               Killed him.


               My gosh, Norman.


               Yeah, it was awful.


               What about you?  What happened to
               you?


               Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed.
               It itched for a while, but I
               survived.
                    
               Beth, do you find it... curious that
               we're seeing all this life down
               here.  Nothing, and then these
               enormous flocks of squid.  Then
               jellyfish?


               Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's
               quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no
               electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's
               curious is -- these aren't normal
               jellyfish.


               What do you mean -- not normal?


               They have six tentacles.  A new
               species.  And the squid too.  They had
               no stomach.


               Wait a minute.


               What?


               You knew about the squid not being
               normal.  Before Fletcher went out
               there?


               Yeah, why?


               And you didn't tell anyone?

     Beth, nervous... 


               What?  Why... 


               Beth --


               I mean, I'm not... I wasn't
               absolutely sure if... they --


               They are or they aren't.  Which is
               it?


               What?...  Wait.  Don't... why are
               you --


               Beth.


               Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why
               are you looking at me like that?


               Beth --

     She backs away from Norman, knocking off a speciman jar, it SHATTERS
     on the floor.  She starts breaking down.

     Norman watching her, falling to the ground, picking up the glass,
     hurriedly... 


               I didn't do anything wrong.  I didn't
               mean... 


               Beth.

     She's crying, glass in her hands.  She looks up at Norman, frightened,
     nervous... 


               You wouldn't go and tell the others,
               would you?

     Norman hesitates, goes to her, tries to hold her, but she pushes him
     away.


               I hate this place, Norman.  I want
               out.





     LOOKING DOWN -- at the room where Barnes was on the phone earlier.  He
     stands there now, hand on the knob.

     CLOSES it shut.





     Barnes sits, Norman in front of him, worked up... 


               I'm not paranoid.  I know Beth.  She
               can be drastic.


               How drastic?


               You don't want to know.


               I think I do.


               A while back, Beth and I -- we
               worked at the same university.  She
               was assisting a chemist there -- I
               forget his name -- doing research,
               experiments.  She was also living
               with him.
                    
               Yeah, I know.  And when she finished
               her work, he kicked her out, broke
               off the relationship, and published
               five papers -- all her work --
               without any thank you or
               acknowledgement.


               She should've known better.


               She put a razor to her wrists a day
               later.


                    
               When was this?


               '81, I think.  She tried again five
               years ago.
                    
               I thought you should know.


               So you knew this when you wrote your
               report?


               At the time, I don't know, I thought
               putting her on the list -- it might
               help her career -- catch her a
               break.


               You knowingly recommended a woman
               with suicidal tendencies for a
               government operation --


               Wait a second --


               -- and then brought her down here --


               -- I didn't know it would come to
               this --


               -- without a cautionary word to
               anyone.
                    
               You know, Ted said something to me
               earlier.  I think he's right.  He
               said, "When you got a guy who -- if
               he wasn't here -- he'd be standing
               in the unemployment line, you gotta
               question if you got the right guy."

     ON NORMAN -- sweating.



     ON THE MONITOR -- a series of numbers:












               It's the same as before, but the
               spacing's different now.  It's
               definitely nonrandom.  See... 

     Harry sitting at the monitor, shows Ted, Barnes, Norman, and Edmunds a
     PRINTOUT of the screan -- indicating a pattern.


               It's a single sequence repeated over
               and over.


               We're all very proud of you, Harry,
               but what the hell is it?


               Maybe it's a message?


               From what?


               The sphere.  Maybe the sphere --


               We're not hooked up to the sphere.


               Well, if it's a discharge --


               It's not a discharge.  Right,
               Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So
               it's gotta be a message.


               From the sphere?


               What's inside the sphere.


               If it is a message, it's probably a
               substitution code.  I'll work on it.


               Yeah, I'll work on it, too.


                    
               You do that.



     Ted, nervous, anxious -- with five or six printouts in his hand -- has
     Norman's ear in front of the sink... 


               He's manic, Norman.  You know that?
               This reliance on Harry is misplaced.
               You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's
               overlooking things.  Obvious things.


               Like what?

     Ted hands him a printout... 


               It's not some fucking substitution
               code, it's a direct visual
               representation.


               You mean a picture?


               Take a look.  I rearranged the
               numbers.  Put 'em up to the light.
                    
               Go ahead.  Squint at it.


               I don't see anything.


               Squint harder.


               Please, Ted.


                    (hands him another
                    printout)
               Try this one.


               This is like nursery school.


               Don't you see it?  It's a picture of
               the creature.


               The creature?


               Inside the sphere.  Look, that's the
               vertical torso, three legs, two
               arms.  There's no head, so I'm
               guessing the creature's head is
               located within the torso itself, you
               know?

     ON NORMAN -- Ted's lost it.


               Well, how about we wait and see what
               Harry comes up with?


               Sure, why not.  Give him the trophy.
               That pretentious son of a bitch.  You
               heard him, Norman.  All that "someone
               went to a lot of trouble, try again"
               bullshit.  And "impotent".  Where does
               he get off saying I'm impotent?  He's
               a fucking self-righteous, little
               prick.



     CLOSE ON MONITOR -- spirals now.


               ... I asked myself, why would the
               sphere be using a code?  If you're
               trying to communicate, why use a
               code?


                    
               See?  No code.  What'd I say?


               Codes are for  information.  So
               it's making a mistake.  It's making a
               code without intending to.  I figured
               it's probably substituting numbers
               for letters...  Then I began to wonder
               what an alien intelligence would
               make of our keyboard.  And since
               we're getting spirals, I imagined
               the keyboard as a spiral.  So I
               translated it... 


               That's brilliant.

     Ted grimaces at Norman.


               ... spiralling out of the center, you
               see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is
               three, and so on... when I got the
               message.


               What's the message?


               I have to tell you.  It's strange.


               How do you mean, strange?

     Harry picks up his yellow pad of paper and reads:


               "Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What
               is your name?  My name is Jerry."





     Barnes walks briskly down the hall, Norman with him... 


               He translated it wrong.  "My name is
               Jerry"?  It's like "See Spot run."


               The message doesn't show a lack of
               intelligence.  It's smart.  It's
               approaching us in a simple way.  Like
               you would a dog.  Holding out your
               hand, letting it sniff, get used to
               you.


               What am I -- a dog, now?

     Barnes ducks his head into the Video Feed room... 


               Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for
               this.


               In a minute, sir.



     Barnes storming through the room, the others  around
     the monitor.


               I want a name.  A real name.  This
               thing's full name, rank and serial
               number.


               Captain, I personally feel we should
               ask much more substantive
               questions --


               I am not gonna explain in some damn
               report that one person died in a
               deepsat expedition so we could meet
               an alien named Jerry.


                    (on the keyboard,
                    typing)
               First, we have to see if he'll talk
               at all.



     The monitor BLINKS, reply:




               Okay, Jerry's talking.

     Harry types -- "0002921 301321 0613182108142232"


               What'd you say?


               "We are friends".


               Cut the friends crap, get a name.




               "Yes".  Good.  Now let's see if it'll
               switch over to English letters.

               It's not talking, it's mimicking.


               Give him a chance.  He's speaking our
               language, not the other way around.


                    
               Good idea, Ted.

               It's not ignorant.


               Maybe it's  to be
               ignorant.

               He's saying, "Take me to your
               leader." He wants to know who's in
               charge.


               I'm in charge.

     "Yes.  The control entity is Captain Harald Barnes"


               With an "o".  Harold with an "o".


               What -- you want me to retype it?

     Harry: "Who are you?"

     "I am one"

     "Where are you from?"

     "I am here"

     "Where is the location from where you began?"


               "From where you began?" That's not
               even good English.

     "I am from AWARENESS"


               What is that, a planet?

     am Happy."


               Great, okay.  Ask him about his
               weapons.


               That's smart.  Let's talk about guns
               and violence.


               You don't think weapons are
               important?


               I think we should be careful.
               Consider his emotional response.


               You want to put him on your couch,
               Norman.  Grill him about his
               childhood?


               When he uses a phrase like "I am
               Happy", I think we should think
               twice about what we ask him.

     "Do Not Be Afraid"

     The all stare at the screen, stunned.


               Jerry, can you understand what we're
               saying?

     "Every word"

     Norman walks up to the screen, close to it.


               Jerry, can you read our minds?

     "Yes Norman"

     Barnes goes to the intercom... 


               Edmunds, I want you in here.  Now.

     Norman focuses on the screen, staring.

     ON THE SCREEN -- blank.

     Norman concentrating, on the screen.

     THE SCREEN -- blank.


               Jerry, are you there?

     "Yes, Norman"


               We shouldn't talk here.  Shut it off.

     "I do not wish to Intrude"


               We would like to talk alone.

     "I do not agree.  That is not possible.  I enjoy to talk with you."


               And we enjoy talking with you.

     "Let us talk now"


               We'd like to talk with you more.  We
               admire your talents and your great
               power and understanding.

     "Thank you"


               And in your great understanding, you
               know that we are entities who must
               talk in private -- with each other.

     "Do Not Be Afraid"


               We're not afraid, we are
               uncomfortable.

     "Am I offended you?"


               Not at all, we enjoy you very much,
               but we need to talk alone, without
               you listening.

     "I shall oblige"


               Thank you.

     SCREEN -- blank.

     SCREEN -- blank.


                    
               Edmunds?  Get in here.  I want to know
               exactly how this is being
               transmitted.


               She's not gonna know.


               She wired this system.


               If the technology of that sphere is
               advanced enough -- the way it
               functions is gonna appear to us like
               magic.




               Don't gimme that psychology
               bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a
               science, it's superstition.  It's a
               bunch of soft, subjective theories
               without any hard data to back it up.
               With an intellect like this,
               emotions don't mean shit.




               It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci
               a laptop computer.  He'd run
               screaming "witchcraft".  And you
               couldn't explain it to him, either.
               Modems, microchips, particle
               physics.


                    
               Edmunds?




               Don't make stuff up, these emotional
               theories, just so you can feel
               important here.


               Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if
               Jerry was just a cold, emotionless
               intellect.


               Why's that?


                    
               Edmunds?


               Because if Jerry is powerful and
               also emotional... 


               Damn it, Edmunds?


               ... it raises a very serious
               question: 
               ?




               Edmunds?  Can you copy?

     An empty chair.  Edmunds is not here.  WE HEAR a repeating THUMP.  THUMP.



               Edmunds?

     ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE her body, wedged in a light stand bracket,
     floating in the water, lifeless.  Her helmet THUMPING against the wall
     of the habitat.



     Norman and Beth, in jumpsuits and helmets, walk out from under the
     habitat.  Still HEARING the THUMPING.  They pause, looking around.


               Coast is clear.

     They go to the south end of the habitat.  The THUMPING louder.

     Norman climbs up the grid-like STANCHION, the support beam holding up
     the habitat.  The BODY above him -- flapping in the current.  THUMPING
     against the wall.

     He climbs, reaching the body.  A BOOT swings, catches the LOOP in his
     air hose.  BUBBLES shoot out.


               Norman, your suit -- it's leaking.

     The BOOT comes off in Norman's hand -- and the NAKED FOOT, gray flesh,
     purple toenails, KICKS his faceplate.  Startles him.


               Norman.  Look at this.

     ON EDMUNDS' SUIT -- a long TEAR in the fabric, revealing red, mangled
     FLESH.  Droplets of BLOOD float past Norman's faceplate.


               Her flesh has been macerated.
               Chewed.  I've never seen a bite like
               this before.

     Norman pulls her body out.

     Edmunds' FACEPLATE whips around -- and Norman SEES her staring eyes,
     mouth open in horror.


               I can't feel her bones.  She's like a
               sponge.


               She was crushed.  Feel her skin --
               it's like sandpaper.


               What could have done this?





     Barnes at the monitors, Ted with him.




               What is that?


               The sensors are picking up something
               outside.


               What?

     Barnes flips a switch... 


               It won't register.  It's too big to
               image.


               Too big?



     WHITE EGGS, the size of golf balls descend from above.  Hundreds of
     them.  Beth catches one, inspects it... 


               Norman.


               What are they?


               Eggs.

     From inside their helmets... 


               You people need to hurry back.  The
               sensors have activated.  I don't
               think you're alone out there.



     Ted walks with Norman and Beth... 


               What was it?


               Barnes didn't know.  Couldn't get a
               reading.


               Has Harry spoken with Jerry?


               Not that I know of.  Why?



     Norman and Ted at the console... 


               Jerry?

     No reply.


               Jerry, are you there?

     No reply.


               You think Jerry has something to do
               with what killed Edmunds?  With
               what's out there?


               I'm not sure.





     Beth, scalpel in hand, is making an incision into the shell.


               Looking at the coating here, it's
               definitely marine invertebrate.

     Barnes, Norman, Harry and Ted stand around the table.


               Well, until we know exactly what it
               is, nobody goes outside, understood?


               What was Edmunds doing outside?


               Resetting the sub.


               What sub?


               In the dome hanger.  All our tapes
               are transferred to the sub.  It's on
               a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't
               reset the "delay" button, the sub
               ascends to the surface with the
               tapes.


               What for?


               If something should happen to us,
               the Navy will at least have partial
               records of what happened.


               At least our obituaries will be
               accurate.  That's reassuring.

     ON THE EGG -- splitting open.  A slimy pinkish-brown FLUID oozes out.  A
     FETUS underneath.

     They cover their mouths from the smell.


               What is it?

     Beth picks at it with forceps... 


               I'm not sure.  I've never seen
               anything like it.


               You're a fucking biochemist, aren't
               you?  Can't you tell us something.

     Beth glares at Barnes... 



     Beth, holding a piece of paper in her hand, pulls Norman inside,
     pressing on him... 


               ... He lied to us.  He left us down
               here.


               C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this
               personal.  He told me himself they
               were taking us back.


               Yeah, he  you.  Think.  What was
               Barnes doing before they cut that
               cable loose?  He was on the phone.
               Except that cable is a thousand feet
               long, Norman.  They would've broken
               off communication with us four, five
               minutes before they cleared out.


               So what?


               So who was Barnes talking to at the
               last minute?  Nobody.


               You're jumping to conclusions, Beth.
               Don't get worked up --


               Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here... 

     She shows him the printout in her hand, putting a flashlight on the
     words, reads... 


               "Although advised of risks, all
               personnel elect to remain down for
               duration of storm to continue
               investigation of alien sphere and
               associated spacecraft.  Signed,
               Barnes, USN."


               Where did you get this?


               In Edmunds' things.


               You went through Edmunds' things?


               He's not just a Navy captain -- he
               works for the fucking Pentagon.


               Calm down, Beth.  Alright?


               Don't tell me to calm down!


               It's done, alright?  It's over!  And
               there's not a damn thing we can do
               about it now, okay?

     He turns to leave... 


               You said something to him, didn't
               you?


               What?


               You told him about me?

     ON NORMAN -- pausing, staring at her... 


               Beth --


               You did, didn't you?


               Don't do this.


               You bastard.


               Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together.
               Alright?

     She looks at him, piercing into his eyes... 


               Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.


               Beth --


               No, I should stay calm.  Like you
               say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm.

     Norman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him... 


               Fletcher and Edmunds are dead,
               Norman.  And the only one we can
               trust to run this place is a fucking
               liar.





     ON THE OXYGEN REGULATOR -- bobbing up and down -- keeping track of the
     little that's left.





     Barnes, Norman, Beth, and Ted are gathered around the monitors.  Barnes
     addresses Norman... 


               I don't want you talking to Jerry.


               But sir, I think it's imperative.  I
               think the messages, the animals
               we've seen, what killed Edmunds, the
               reading you got earlier -- I think
               they're all related.


               Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said
               earlier -- we were his friends --


               Of course he did.  He's been isloated
               for 400 years.  He wants someone to
               talk to.  Look, you put a human being
               in isolation for four days, they can
               become neurotic, sometimes
               psychotic.  We're talking about 400
               years here.  An alien that shows
               emotional responses.  I think we need
               to address him, before he reacts
               further.


               You think he killed Edmunds?


               Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I
               think is his response to us refusing
               to talk to him earlier.


               Bullshit.  What's out there isn't
               alien.  It's an animal.


               Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask
               Jerry about it.


               No.  I think we should shut down the
               communication lines inside the
               habitat.  He might be listening now.


               I think he already is.

     They turn to the monitors:




               Nice work, Captain sir.


               Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear
               it.


               Jerry, we don't want to ignore you.

     "Don't underestimate my power"


               We don't.

     "Yes you do"


               Jerry --

     THE MONITOR blinks back -- WE SEE the sphere.  It is closed.  Still.

     WE HEAR the SENSOR: PONG.  PONG.  PONG.





     Harry, alone, stares at THE FETUS on the table.





     ON THE SONAR IMPULSE MONITOR -- lines jumping higher.  PONG.  PONG.  PONG.

     Barnes, Norman, Beth, and Ted watching it.


               Jerry?

     No response.


               Jerry?

     The MONITOR flashes: "I'm Not Listening" -- blinks back.

     AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- infra-red -- a large IMAGE streaks by.


               Direction's east coming!


               What was that?

     Barnes flips a switch... 


               Going active.


               Jerry?

     No response.


               It looked like a tentacle.  Of a
               squid.

     THE MONITORS -- BEEPING now.


               A squid?  The size of a whale?  I
               don't think so.
                    
               Target acquired.  Sixty yards.




               What if it attacks?


               Fifty yards and closing.


               What do we use for defense?


               We're a habitat.  Not a castle.  The
               only defense we have is High
               Voltage.


               High Voltage?


               It sends 200 volts throughout the
               cylinder surface.  But we've never
               used it underwater before.




               Forty yards.


               But you've tested it?


               Sure.  Each time it started fires
               inside the habitat.




               Thirty yards.


               What are you saying -- we can't stop
               what's out there?

     THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING".  The monitor blinks to BLANK.


               What the hell?
                    
               It shut us down.


               Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.


               Ted, go into the control room.
               Listen for my instructions.

     Ted goes out the door.

     ALL THE MONITORS -- blank.


               Where is it?


               Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is
               going on here?

     They HEAR a metallic CLANKING.


               What was that?


               He's right beneath us.

     THE MONITORS blink: "I AM HERE".





     Harry looking at the FETUS on the table.  It suddenly SLIDES down the
     table.

     The room is rocked.

     ON SHELVES -- Jars, petry dishes, test tubes SLIDE off shattering to
     the floor.





     TED is thrown ruthlessly against the wall.  His HEAD striking metal,
     splitting open his forehead.

     THE WALLS -- CRACKING and GROANING.

     WATER breaks through a crack, spreading out onto the floor.



     Barnes... 


               Ted?  Ted?



     Ted, stumbles, reaches for the headset... 


               Sir, we're leaking!

     Blood dripping from his forehead.




               Increase positive pressure!


               That's our reserve air.


               It's either that or we grow gills.

     BANG!  They grip onto the console... 



     Ted, drousy, BLOOD gushing from his head, keeping balance, searches
     for the PRESSURE GAGE.


               Ted?  Ted, are you with me?

     Finds the GAGE.  Turns it.


               Increasing positive pressure.



     AIR BUBBLES burst out of the walls.



     ON THE FLOOR -- the WATER scurrying back through the leaks in the wall.



     Barnes, watching the monitors.


               That's enough Ted.
                    
               Shut it off!



     THE PRESSURE GAGE -- the needle RISING... 

     ON THE HEADSET -- in the air, dangling from it's cord.


               Ted?  Ted!

     ON TED -- passed out on the floor.  Blood covering his face.



     Beth and Norman BOLT out the door



     Running.  BANG!  They're thrown against the wall.



     THE PRESSURE GAUGE -- rising, higher, higher.



     THUMP!  Norman and Beth, losing their balance, stumbling to their
     feet, running... 

     ON TED -- SLIDING out of the Control Room, down the corridor, taken by
     the water.

     Beth grabs him, as Norman stumbles



     finds the PRESSURE GAGE, shuts it off.



     BANG!  Barnes grips his headset as he's thrown to the floor.


               Norman!  Norman can you hear me?



     Norman grabs the headset, slips it on... 


               Yes, sir.  I'm here.


               You see the lever on the green box?
               Upper right hand corner?

     Norman sees it, reads it:


               High Voltage Defense System.

     ON BETH -- in the hall, tending to Ted, looks up at Norman.




               You see the lever next to it?



     Beth yelling... 


               Don't do it, Norman!


               Do you see it?

     ON NORMAN -- turning from Beth, to the lever.


               I see it.


               Pull it.


               Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a
                we can't stop.  Norman?


               Do it, Norman, it's the only choice
               we have.  This thing is gonna crush
               us.


               Norman, don't do it!

     BANG!  The WALLS CREAKING and SCREECHING.



     Barnes on the floor, a MONITOR crashes alongside him, SPITTING SPARKS,
     flashing: "I WILL KILL YOU"


               Do it now!



     Norman, sweating... 


               Don't do it!


               Now!

     BANG!  CREAKING, GROANING of metal.


               Norman, please!  Don't!




               Pull it, damn it!

     ON NORMAN -- puts his hand on the lever.


               Norman!

     He PULLS the lever.



     DOWN THE CORRIDORS -- a loud HUM from the generators.  The lights


     BANG!  WE HEAR what seems to be a SQUEAL, as the metal RENDS and




     An ALARM SOUNDS.

     Barnes looks up... 

     THE WARNING BOARD lights up.


               Fire in Communications Room!



     FIRE ROARS out from the walls... 



     CLOSE ON FIRE EXTINGUISHER CASE -- Beth whips it open, grabs it.

     ON NORMAN -- picking up Ted, lugging him awkwardly over his shoulder.

     ON BARNES -- running down the corridor towards them.

     BANG!  Barnes falls to the floor, taken away by the water.



     ANOTHER CASE ON THE WALL -- whips open -- Beth grabs GAS MASKS.  She
     hears... 


               Help!

     She looks DOWN THE CORRIDOR at... 

     BARNES -- on the floor, flailing in the water, SCREAMING, as his legs
     are caught in a CRACK in the wall.  Desperate... 


               Beth!  Help, I can't -- !

     ON BETH -- staring at him.  Just watching him.  Not moving.


               Beth!

     BARNES -- his body falling through the crack, his HEAD BANGS into the
     wall, stuck in the crack, water choking him... 


               Be--

     ... trying to SCREAM, his NECK RIPPING, SNAPS, and his body vanishes
     into the ocean.

     ON BETH -- cold, turns away.



     FIRE blasts out from the wall... 

     BETH and NORMAN  wearing GAS MASKS, RUSH into the
     room... 


               Stay low!

     Beth sprays WHITE FOAM on the fierce FLAMES, licking up the side
     padding, smoke boils to the cieling.

     BANG!  The room is rocked.


               It won't stop.

     Norman falls to the floor, losing Ted.

     TED -- SLIDES away and UNDER the computer CONSOLE.

     BANG!  The computer CONSOLE breaks -- COMPUTERS, MONITORS, fall,
     CRUSHING on Ted's legs.  He SCREAMS out in agony.

     NORMAN scrambles towards him through the smoke when... 

     THE CONSOLE catches fire, erupts in flame.  Ted underneath it.

     BETH -- her extinguisher out of foam.

     NORMAN -- runs to a wall, finds an EXTINGUISHER CASING, it's been bent,
     can't get it open.

     TED -- reaches out in desperation as his LEGS catch fire.


               Norman!

     NORMAN -- BASHES the casing in with his shoulder, grabs the
     extinguisher, turns... 

     TED -- his entire body on fire.

     BANG!  Norman falls, dropping the extinguisher -- it rolls across the
     floor.  He reaches out -- can't get it.

     CLOSE ON TED -- his face burning... 


               Norman!  Nor--

     BANG!  The lights go out.



     NORMAN -- watches in horror as he watches TED, lit in flame, burning to
     death.

     NORMAN -- reaches for the wall for balance, grabs METAL, and he's
     ELECTRICUTED.  Falls backward, head first, and EVERYTHING GOES... 



     A long beat.


               Dr. Johnson?  Dr. Johnson?



     WE FOCUS in on Norman, as he awakens.  NAVY SEAMAN, 40s, African-
     American, standing above him.


               Norman Johnson.


               Does this mean what I think it
               means?


               It's over, sir, The storm has
               cleared.


               The ships?


               They're topside.  We're ready to take
               you home, sir.

     The Navy Seaman helps Norman to his feet.  Norman is smiling, it's
     over.



     Norman and the Navy Seaman walk down the hall.


               How are the others?


               The others, sir?


               Beth and Harry?


               They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting.

     Norman sighs, smiling.  The relief, the jubilation.


               That whole time -- I couldn't stop
               thinking of what Harry was saying
               earlier... 


               What was that, sir?


               About the time paradox.
                    
               How we were all going to die --
               that there was no way we would make
               it out of here alive --

     As Norman looks up, the Navy Seaman, still walking and nodding, begins
     to slowly DISAPPEAR.  Disintigrating.  VANISHING before his eyes.

     Norman stops, looks around him.  He's gone.



     Norman watches on a monitor -- the VIDEO of him walking down the hall,
     the Navy Seaman walking next to him.


               ... how we were all going to die --
               that there was no way we would make
               it out of here alive --

     ON THE MONITOR -- the Seaman disappers.

     Norman stops tape.  Looks over at the MONITOR showing the SPHERE.  It is
     closed.

     THE SCREEN goes BLACK.  Flashes up: "Hello Norman"


               Jerry?

     "Yes Norman"


               Jerry, did you create that man?

     "The entity Navy Seaman was a Manifestation.  Did you have a Happy
     talk?"


               Jerry, are you manifesting what's
               destroying our habitat?

     "Did you have a Happy talk?"


               Jerry, answer me.

     "No."


               Jerry?

     A beat.

     "Stop calling me Jerry"

     The MONITOR shuts off.

     Norman looks over at ANOTHER MONITOR labled "AIRLOCK FEED".

     ON THE SCREEN -- Beth is putting on her jumpsuit.



     REFLECTED IN THE POOL OF WATER -- WE SEE Beth, slipping on her boots.


               Where are you going in such a hurry?


               I have to reset the sub.

     Norman stands in the doorway... 


               Forget the sub.


               Don't bother me, Norman.


               It's not worth the risk.


               It's also our only way out of here!
               It holds three people.  And there's
               only three of us left now.


               You, me and Harry?


               You, me and Harry.  He's asleep.


               Wake him, then.  Let's go.  Get
               outta --


               We can't.  The storm.  The waves would
               toss us around worse than we got
               down here.  And we have four days of
               decompression when we get up top.


               Four days?


               Get the helium out of our
               bloodstream.  We go to the surface
               now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.

     She begins to put on her helmet, when she stops.


               Maybe you should go.  To the sub.


               Why should I go?


               You should know how it works.  Just
               in case.


               In case you die, too?


               I don't trust Harry to do it.


               I would.  But my suit --


               I fixed your suit.

     She goes to it.  Brings it to him.


                    
               You fixed my suit?


               You don't trust me?


               But I don't know how --


               You press a button, Norman.  It's not
               brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You
               only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go
               on, Norman... 

     She hands him a BRIEFCASE, the tapes inside.


               ... I'll watch the sensors for you.



     Norman drops to the bottom with the BRIEFCASE.  Lands on the ground.
     BREATHING.  Checks his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.  She must've fixed it.


               You're clear, Norman.

     He walks along, out from under the habitat.  Carefully, looking around.


               The sub's a 100 feet in front of
               you.  You see it?


               I can't see anything.  How does it
               look?  Still clear?


               Still clear.

     Norman, hesitantly, ventures out.  The DARK WATER.  Looking around.
     Anything could be out here.  Walking.  WE HEAR him BREATHING.  His
     BREATHING gets shorter.  He looks at his LIFE SUPPORT BADGE.


               What's the matter?


               You fixed this suit?
                    
               Beth?


               Yes, Norman.  I did.  You're just
               nervous.


               My air isn't... I'm coming back.


               You can't.  Counter's at 10 minutes.
               You don't have time.

     His BREATHING is short, but managable.  He continues on.

     AHEAD OF HIM -- the DOME HANGER attached to a large, gray cylinder,
     forty feet high.


               Still clear?


               Still clear.

     UNDERNEATH THE DOME HANGER -- Norman climbs up to the hatch DOOR.  Looks
     below him.  Nothing around him.  He SPINS the wheel, and pushes the
     HATCH OPEN.  Lifts himself up, awkwardly.  Grabs HANDHOLDS, and PULLS
     himself up into the POCKET OF AIR trapped inside the dome.

     THE SUB -- in front of him.  He finds the hatch, opens it, climbs inside
     the sub.



     Norman sits in the small seat.


               I'm in.
                    
               Hello?

     No answer.  He bangs at his helmet... 


               Beth?

     He searches the sub's CONTROL PANEL.  Gadgets, switches, buttons.  Up
     top -- a flashing red-lit BUTTON: "TIMER HOLD".  Punches it.  It stops
     flashing, and a small screen glows: "TIMER RESET -- COUNT: 12:00:00".
     It begins counting backwards.


               Beth?  Hello?

     No answer.  He looks at the Control Panel:

     A VIDEO SCREEN with the choices: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE,




     The sub slightly SWAYS.

     Norman sits still, nervous.

     THUMP!  Harder this time.

     Norman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD.  Sweating.  Can't see
     anything in here.

     BANG!  It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth.  He grips the seat.


               Beth!  Beth!  There's something -- !

     THUMP!  BANG!  He's thrown around in the sub.  He can't see anything,
     tosses around.  He reaches for the doorhandle.

     BANG!  He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  The Sub almost turns
     over on it's side.


               Beth!  Shit!

     His HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.  Water
     SPLASHING up from below.

     Then, EVERYTHING stops.

     The sub SWAYS to a still.  He sits quietly.  Waiting.  Listening.

     Reaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out.

     Stands on top of the sub.  Keeping balance.  He looks around, finds a
     DOOR inside the dome.  Tries to open it.  Locked.

     Looks around.  Nothing else.  Looks down at the water.  Can he risk it?
     His BREATHING short.


               Beth?  Can you hear me?

     No reply.  He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  Grimacing.
     Then, cautiously slips down into the water... 



     CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.  Looking everywhere.  Searching.  Doesn't
     see anything.  Lands on the bottom.

     His LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.  Shortness of BREATH.

     He walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  The DARK
     WATER.  Can't see anything.  Scared to death.


               Beth?  Beth?  Shit.

     THE HABITAT -- ahead of him.

     Norman goes to a STANCHION.  Grips onto it.  Twists around.  Looking.
     Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster.
     Barely BREATHING.


               ... you there?  Norman?


               Harry?


               Norman, where are you?


               I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?


               You're clear.  You see the airlock?

     Norman, twists around, and as he does... 



     HISSES at his faceplate.  Norman SCREAMS.

     ON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go.


               Norman!

     Norman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION,
     slithering between the grid-like posts.

     THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom.
     Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him.
     It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  Norman
     backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman
     falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when... 

     NORMAN is whisked up.

     HARRY has him by the collar of his suit.  Taking him up.



     They burst out of the water.  Harry throws Norman onto the floor.
     Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious.



     Norman, panting, walks with Harry... 


               Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she
               fixed it --


               What happened to her?


               What do you mean?  She's not here?


               When I woke up, nobody was here.


               She was supposed to be watching the
               sensor for me.


               Her suit's gone.


               Beth left?


               I thought she was with you.



     Norman and Harry at the mic... 


               ... what do you mean?  I'm in the
               ship.


               What are you doing in the ship?
                    
               Beth?


               Getting food.  We were out of food.
               what's wrong?  You sound mad.


               Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm
               facing death and someone deserts me.


               Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take
               over for me.


               He what?

     Harry shakes his head: "no way".


               When he woke up, he said we were out
               of food.  He told me to get some from
               the ship.


               I never said that.


               Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't
               leave you out there.  You know that.


               We never even had a conversation,
               Norman.


               Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood
               right there --

     Harry covers the mic... 


               She's cracking, Norman.


               You didn't say that about the food?


               I was just in the cafeteria, there's
               plenty of food in there.  Take a look
               for yourself.


               But why would she -- ?


               She's lying, Norman.  Just like she
               lied about fixing your suit.

     Harry uncovers the mic... 


               You get it straightened out?


               I think so, Beth.  Yes.



     Norman, sitting at a table, eating a couple pieces of cold chicken.

     A salad, some fruit, and boxes of crackers on the table.

     Beth walks in, carrying a bag of food.


               What's Harry doing with your suit in
               there?


               Fixing it.


               Fixing it?  But I fixed --
                    
               Where'd you get all that?


               The refridgerator.


               The refridgerator.


               It's a pretty common place to look
               for food when you don't think you
               have any.


               That wasn't in there before.


               We must've had it delivered then.


               Wait a second --


               1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear
               they're good.


               None of this was here before.


               Did you look?  It was on the top
               shelf.


               No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this
               was here.  None of it.
                    
               You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He
               must've hid it.


               You think?


               You don't believe me.


               All I know is I opened that
               refridgerator --


               Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a
               whole conversation with the man when
               he woke up.


               This being after you so carefully
               fixed my suit.


               You think it's me?  You think I'm
               saying there was a conversation when
               there wasn't?


               I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there.


               Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't
               you get it?  There is something
               seriously fucked up going on here --
               and he's causing it.  Why can't you
               believe me?

     TO HER LEFT -- she looks -- HARRY is standing in a doorway, cold,
     holding Norman's jumpsuit.  He turns away.

     ON BETH -- looking back at Norman, tears rolling down her eyes.





     Harry neatly hangs Norman's jumpsuit under the hook labled: "JOHNSON".
     Smoothens it out for him.





     ON BETH -- sitting at a table, her face in her hands.

     ON NORMAN -- looking at her, as he closes a box of crackers.  Wraps
     cellophane over the chicken.  Walks with it over to the refridgerator.
     Opens it, placing the chicken inside... but he can't.



     are BOOKS -- neatly lined up on each of the shelves.

     NORMAN -- backs away.  What the hell?

     Norman now looks at the CUPBOARDS.  Goes to them.



     Books, neatly stacked.

     Norman, panicking, opens each of the cupboards, all of them with


     All of the books are the same.  Entitled: "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea
     by Jules Verne."

     Norman looks over at Beth.


               What is it, Norman?  Norman?

     She comes to him.  He stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing.


               Norman?

     Norman paces, frantic almost, running his hands through his hair,
     trying to think.  Stops.  Turns to Beth.


               Page 87.


               What?


               Page 87.  "I could never read that
               far."

     Norman quickly plucks a book from a shelf, turns pages, gets to page
     87.  Reads... 


               "Our fisherman frequently see some
               that are more than four feet long.
               Some skeletons of squids... 


               Squids?


               "... according to calculations of
               some naturalists, one of these
               animals, only six feet long, would
               have tentacles 27 feet long.  That
               would make a formidable monster."

     He looks up from the book, realizing something... 


               Norman?

     SNAPS the book closed.





     CLOSE ON HARRY'S DUFFLEBAG -- Norman rifles through notebooks.  Turning
     pages.

     TEARS off the first Jerry transmission.

     Beth, standing at the doorway, keeping watch down the hall.


               Norman, what is it?

     Norman grabs Harry's YELLOW PAD OF PAPER.



     THEIR FEET -- scurrying through the water soaked corridor.

     Norman ushers her into the Control Room.  Looks around.  SHUTS the door.





     Norman SCRIBBLES on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of
     paper... 


               After the attack, a Navy guy woke me
               up -- I don't know -- I thought he
               was an illusion.  But I checked the
               tape, and Jerry said he manifested
               him.


               Manifested?


               Created.  Brought to life.  I don't
               know.  But at the end, Jerry said,
               "Stop calling me Jerry".  And --

     Norman stops, staring at the pad.


               He translated it wrong.


               What?

     Norman picks up the pad of paper, reads... 


               Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What
               is your name?...  .





     Harry is walking towards the Living Quarters... 


               Remember when we first spoke to
               Jerry, Barnes kept asking for
               Jerry's real name?  But Harry never
               would?  He didn't because he was
               afraid the screen would say "Harry",
               instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking
               to an alien intelligence when we
               talked to Jerry, we were talking to
               Harry... or a part of Harry.


               What do you mean, a part of Harry?




               When did the messages start?  The
               animals outside start showing up?
               After Harry came out of the sphere.


               You think, in the sphere --


               He acquired some sort of power.  A
               power to manifest things.


               But how?


               I don't know.


               How can the sphere do that?


               I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the
               fucking alien that built the thing.
               But it can.  When Harry came out of
               the sphere, he mumbled something
               about page 87.  How he would never
               read that far -- he was too scared
               to.  Then you found the book,
               remember in your lab.  Then in the
               cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about
               a giant squid... 


               Which I told Barnes was attacking --


               It's his fear.  The squid.  He's
               manifesting his fears.  Making them
               real.


               But why is he doing it?


               He must not realize he is.  Like the
               Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping
               then.  He must've manifested his
               dream.


               His dream?  You can't control your
               dreams.  And you can't control your
               fears, can you?


                    
               No.  I mean, we've always believed we
               can think anything we want without
               consequences.  You ever read the
               Bible?
                    
               It talks about our sinful nature,
               you know?  I mean, we can think, and
               believe, and desire whatever we
               want, but there's a part of us -- a
               shadow side, as Jung called it --
               that can't be controlled.  It's evil.
               It's inside us.  It's what we are.





     It's dark.  Harry lies on his bunk, asleep.


               And that's the part of Harry that's
               being manifested.


               Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part
               of him not even he can control.

     Harry opens his eyes, stares at us.





     ON SCREEN -- a transmission comes across... 



     Beth and Norman watch... 


               Looks like some sort of code.


               Why would Harry go back to using a
               code?


               You mean Jerry, don't you?

     Harry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room.


               Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't



               That's a hell of a mistake to make,
               Beth.


               I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.


               Yeah, I don't know how you could
               make that confusion.

     Norman watching them... 


               Wisconsin's your answer.


               Wisconsin?


                    
               Navy transmission.  They're sent from
               Wisconsin.


               How do we decode it?


               Don't have to.  Watch.  It'll do it
               for you.

     THE SCREEN -- jumbling it's letters until finally... 



     Norman and Beth smile... 


               The cavalry is on it's way.

     THE SCREEN -- "16:00:00"... it begins decending in count.


               Just in time, too.


               In time for what?


               What?


               Just in time for what?

     Beth, nervous, tries to cover... 


               Our habitat, I mean.  This place
               can't handle another attack.


               Another attack?

     A long beat, as Beth stares at Harry.


               Why are you looking at me like that?


               Like what?  I'm not --


               You're staring at me.


               No I'm not.  I'm not star--


               Yes you are... 

     Harry looks at both of them, suspiciously... 


               Did I miss something?  You two seemed
               to patch things up awfully fast.

     A tense beat.


               We just figured, you know, the three
               of us -- we need to... work together
               through this.


               The three of us.


               That's right.


                    
               Is that why the two of you went
               through my dufflebag?

     Norman glances at THE SCREEN behind Harry: "I WILL KILL YOU ALL."



     CLOSE ON THE MEDICAL CABINET -- WHIPPING open.

     Norman quickly digs through the medicines... 


               Diphenyl parlene.


               Something for burns.


               Ephedrine hydrochloride.

     Beth at the computer, looking up the names... 


               It's for motion sickness.


               Valdomet.


               Ulcers.


               Sintag.


               A synthetic opium analogue.


               Does it cause drowsiness?  That's all
               we need.  To get him unconscious --
               put him under.


               Nothing about drowsiness.


               Tarazine?


               Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.


               Bingo.


               "... and may also cause bizarre
               halucinations".

     Norman throws it on the floor.  Picks another... 


               Riordan?


               Antihistamine.  For bites.


               Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?


               Antibiotic.


               Parasolutrine?


               How do you spell it?


               P-a-r-a-s-o... 


               It's a soporific.


               What's that?


               Causes sleep.


               It's like a sleeping pill?


               "... used as an anesthetic if given
               in combination with paracin
               trichloride... "

     Norman digs, finds paracin trichloride... 


               Here we go.



     BETH -- mixing the medicines... 


                    (reading from the
                    computer)
               "20 cc's of parasolutrine in
               combination with 6 cc's of paracin
               given IV produces deep sleep
               suitable for emergency surgical
               procedures... no cardiac side effects
               ... REM activity is surpressed... "


               How long does it last?


               Three to six hours.


               I'll just boost the doses.


               What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous?


               How fast does it take effect?


               Doesn't say.


               What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman?
               What if it takes an hour?  And he can
               fight it off?  We can't afford that.

     Beth goes to the cabinet, grabs another medicine.  Norman comes over as
     she adds it to the mix... 


               What is that?  What are you doing?
               What do you want to do -- kill him?

     A beat... 


               It's an idea.


               Beth --


               To be on the safe side.  I mean --


               You want to kill him?


               Look, it's either him or us, Norman.
               Another attack, and we go down with
               this place.

     She fills the LARGE SYRINGE with the clear liquid mix.


               You ever given an injection before.


               Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I
               passed out.  You?


               Only lab rats.  Here.

     She hands him the syringe... 


               Give him the whole thing.  Hurry,
               before he wakes up.

     Norman looks at the syringe, like it's an assault rifle.


               Where do I stick it?





     Harry sleeps on his bunk.  The door to the room is closed.



     Norman spirals down the stairway from the lab.  Hurrying through the
     dark cafeteria, the syringe at his side.



     shuffling down the corridor, nervously.  Glancing at the syringe.



     and SEES in front of the Living Quarters... 

     TWO AFRICAN-AMERICAN NAVY CREWMEN -- standing guard of the door.

     Norman stops, hides behind the wall.





     Norman comes in... 


               He's got Farrakahn's army standing
               guard.  What's plan B?

     Suddenly, BANG!  The room shakes.  Shelves fall.  Cabinet doors swing
     open.  Norman falls to the floor.

     THE COMPUTER MONITOR -- crashes down in front of his face.  It reads: "I




     Norman and Beth running... 


               Harry!

     BANG!  Water shoots through the wall.  Gushing out onto the floor.  The
     walls CRACKING.

     ON HARRY -- running out of his room... 


               What is it?


               You know what it is, Harry.

     BANG!  They lose their balance, still running... 


               It's the squid!  Stop it!


               Stop what?  What are you -- ?

     BANG!  Another CRACK -- water gushing inside.


               You know damn well what.  You're
               doing it!

     Norman grabs Harry, pushes him up against the wall.


               Doing what?  I'm not doing
               anything -- !

     Beth takes the syringe from her palm, and STABS Harry in the SHOULDER.





     Quiet now.



     Norman and Beth sit at a table, sipping coffee.


               I'm sorry.


               For what?


               Not believing you.


               You're not sorry.  You're scared.
                    
               You're a psychologist, Norman.  You
               pride yourself on knowing when
               someone's lying to you, not telling
               you the truth.  And now you're scared
               ... because you're not sure you can
               tell anymore.

     ON NORMAN -- watching her, sizing her up.



     ON HARRY -- lying on a STRETCHER in the corner, propped up with pillows
     and a blanket.  An IV in his arm.

     NORMAN -- at the console, stares at the MONITOR of the SPHERE.  A long
     beat.  His reflection staring back at him.  He slips on the headset... 


               Beth?



     The room is empty.


               Beth?



     Empty.


               Can you copy?



     ON THE JUMPSUIT HANGERS -- the jumpsuit under the name "DR. BETH
     HALPERIN" is missing.


               Beth?



     Norman at the mic... 


               What is it, Norman?


               Where are you?


               In the sub.  Resetting the timer.
               Why?

     ON THE MONITOR -- Beth sitting in the sub.


               The sphere looks different.


               What do you mean, different?


               The grooves around the door --
               they've shifted.  And the pattern --
               the fluids -- they look darker now.


                    
               How's Harry?

     ON HARRY -- the IV in his arm.


               He's fine.



     CLOSE ON A MONITOR: "12:30:00"... descending in count.





     Norman pouring himself more coffee, alone.





     Beth's suit still gone.





     Harry lying on the stretcher, still.

     Norman watching him from above, sipping his coffee.



     Norman goes to the console, sits.  Checks the monitors.  Looks around
     the console, not knowing what it is.

     A FLASHING LIGHT on the Sensor Board.  Norman still doesn't know what
     it means.

     THE MONITORS go blank.


               Beth --

     The MONITORS flash up: "I AM COMING."

     Norman spins around, goes to HARRY -- lying still.  Norman grabs
     Harry's wrist.  Checking pulse.

     Norman returns to the console, slips on the headset... 


               Beth?  Beth?  Can you hear me?  Get the
               hell out of there.

     THE MONITORS boot up again.  Norman looks at the SUB VIDEO MONITOR --
     the sub is gone from under the dome.


               Beth?
                    
               Beth?  Shit.

     No reply.  MORE BEEPING.  Panicking.  Bangs on the headset.


               Beth?  I'm getting some sort of
               reading.  There's something --

     He scans the MONITORS, looking for movement.  Anything.  They are all
     still.

     Norman turns to looks at Harry... 

     CLOSE ON HARRY'S FACE -- still.

     BACK ON -- NORMAN, sweating... 


               And whatever it is, it's not coming
               from Harry.

     Norman looks at the monitors:

     ON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN.  It's
     Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat.

     The Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES.  The lettering on the boxes
     isn't in focus.

     Norman squints at the MONITOR -- can't make it out.


               Beth?  What is that?  What are you
               doing?

     The Sub's CLAW ARMS drops one of the BOXES, plumping it softly on the
     muddy floor.


               Can you hear me?  Beth?  Can you copy?
               Get inside, there's something out
               there.

     ON ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub moves forward.  Churning up the sediment.
     It stops again, and releases another box.

     Norman BANGS on the headset.


               Damn it, Beth, I know you hear me.

     THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING FOR YOU"

     ON NORMAN -- breathing heavy.


               What the hell?

     ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub in view -- a closer view.  It releases it's
     last box.  Norman can read the lettering now: "CAUTION: TEVAC



               Beth?  C'mon.  What are you -- ?

     THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"


               Oh shit.

     Norman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET.
     Searching for tapes.  Another cabinet.  Then another.

     A shelf labled: "SPHERE" -- all the tapes are gone.


               It's her.

     THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU"

     ON THE HEADSET -- resting on the console.  WE HEAR faintly... 


               Norman?  Norman?



     Norman pushes Harry and his IV down the corridor.  Hurrying.  An inch or
     two of water on the floor.



     CLOSE ON A METAL CASE -- labled: "Captain Harold Barnes."

     Norman BANGS it against the wall, trying to bust the LOCK.  BANGING.
     BANGING.  Breaks the lock.  Digs inside the case.

     Pulls out a GUN.



     Norman pushing Harry and the IV stand.  Wheels him into... 



     Norman stops.  Turns off the main lights.  The room goes dark.  The
     florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on.

     Norman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall.  Checks the IV.

     Norman goes to a STALL.  Steps inside.  Keeps the stall door open.  Can
     still see Harry about 10 feet away.

     Norman looks at the GUN.  COCKS it.  Pinches his finger.


               Ouch.

     He waits.  Listening.



     Norman looks over at the sinks.

     A FAUCET is on.  Water HISSING faintly from it.

     Norman ignores it.  Waiting in the dark.  Listening.

     ON THE FAUCET -- the water running.

     ON NORMAN -- looking at it.  Can't ignore it.  Tries.  But can't.

     Norman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor.



     The light above them on.  Norman turns the faucet off.  The water stops.

     But the HISSING SOUND remains.

     Norman looks at the faucet, queerly.  Turns it back on.  Then off.

     The HISSING SOUND still there.  It isn't the water.

     Norman looks down at his feet... 

     THE FLOOR -- seems to be moving.  Something swimming in the water.

     CLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up
     inside his pantleg, HISSING.  His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly
     slides up past his knee.



     As more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall.

     NORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE
     slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt.

     Another SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman,
     sliding up around his neck.



     NORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides,
     slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin,
     over his face.  Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING.


               What time is it, Norman?

     NORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her
     jumpsuit.


               Do you know the time?

     Norman GLARES at her in the mirror.  His body STIFF.


               I have to know the time of day,
               Norman.  Do you know?

     SNAKES covering his eyes, SLITHERING across his mouth.


                    
               Your watch.

     A SNAKE flicking it's tongue at Norman's lips.  Trying to get inside
     his mouth.


               What was that?  I couldn't hear you.


               Your watch.


               Oh yes, my watch.  I almost forgot.

     She looks at her watch.


               Splendid.

     She begins grabbing the SNAKES off of him, carefully dropping them to
     the ground.  SNAKES writhing in her hands, twisted around her wrists.
     Shakes them off.  Some drop in the sink.  She bends out of view -- and
     the SNAKE inside Norman's shirt, MOVES back down the way it came.

     Past his stomach, his groin.

     Norman HEAVES from his chest, VOMITS on the mirror... 





     CLOSE ON A POT -- pouring a white, milkish DRINK into a cup.

     Beth walks it over to Norman, sitting at a table, looking ill.


               Isotonic glucose supplement.

     Norman looks at the cup.


               Go ahead, drink it.

     Norman places the cup down.


               What's wrong, Norman?


               I'm feeling better.


               Are you?

     Beth takes a seat.  Stares at him.  A long beat.


               It's getting cold.


               You think I'd really drink that?


               You don't think I put something in
               it, do you?


               You put explosives around the
               habitat, I can't imagine what you'd
               put in a drink.


               I did do that, didn't I?

     A beat.  She picks up the drink, and begins sipping it.  Norman watches
     her.


               How do you feel about snakes?


               Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?


               You know what I mean.


               Am I afraid of them?  Not during the
               day.  Sea snakes are diurnal.  When
               the sun's out, they don't bite.
               Fortunately for you, I had on my
               watch.
                    
               This is quite good.


               What are they doing down here?  In
               the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.


               You tell me.


               Do you fear them?


               Don't you?


               Are you manifesting them?


               If I was, then I would've had to
               have gone in the sphere, wouldn't



               Did you?


               What's the phrase -- "keeping up
               with the Joneses"?


               Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?


               Same reason I put explosives around
               the habitat.  For defense.  For the
               power.  To protect myself.


               Against what?  Harry's unconscious.
               He's not a threat.


               No, he isn't.


               He can't manifest.


               No, he can't.


               Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put
               out explosives?  Why manifest the
               snakes?


               You think I manifested the snakes?


               Someone did.


               Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me,
               Norman.
                    
               It was you.  You manifested the
               snakes.

     A long beat between them.


               Beth you're losing it.  C'mon.


               C'mon -- what?


               You're lying --


               Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you
               absolutely sure I'm lying?
                    
               Then explain to me about the
               jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see
               jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear
               jellyfish.  You do.  They're your
               fear, aren't they?


               But --


               And the snakes?  You want to know
               about the snakes?  You saw one
               outside earlier, didn't you?  When
               you thought I had deserted you --
               you were terrified.


                    
               That's when you went in the sphere.


               One lonely, terrifying sea snake.


               You manifested that, Beth.


               Did I?  Or was that you?
                    
               When you were hiding in the bathroom
               -- all conspiratorially like you were
               -- you became frightened, didn't
               you?  Terrified.  Like you were with
               the snake earlier -- and suddenly
               you have snakes slithering all over
               the floor.  You did that, Norman.


               You're insane.


               Am I?  Or am I making so much sense
               that you're going insane?


               I never went in that sphere.


               You don't remember you did.  But I'm
               sure you remember running like some
               fucking hero to get Harry, don't
               you?  You remember that.


               Yes.


               You remember before you picked him
               up -- when you looked up at the
               sphere, you remember that -- when
               the sphere opened?
                    
               That's right.  But you can't remember
               going inside, can you?  No, of course
               not.  Harry couldn't either, could
               he?  "Like everything's on the tip of
               my tongue", he said.


               That's bullshit.


               Is it?


               Beth, the message said Harry.  "My
               name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.


               No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman.
               But your younger brother -- what was
               his name?  The one who was stung when
               you were younger.  The one that died.
               The one you couldn't save.  What was
               his name?
                    
               "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean
               -- to go swimming." "But I don't
               want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm
               scared." "C'mon, , it'll be
               fine, it'll be fun."
                    
               You heartless fuck.  That's why
               you're so scared of the water, isn't
               it?


               Shut up, Beth --


               When you were in that sub -- and
               that squid was attacking you -- are
               you sure it was the squid that was
               attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get
               Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny
               sub on the bottom of the fucking
               ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all
               this water." Was it really the squid
               that was attacking you, Norman -- or
               was it something else -- one of your
               fears?  You never really saw what it
               was, did you?

     Norman stares up at her, frightened.  Is she right?


               I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I
               hope I'm not frightening you.  The
               last thing I want to do is frighten
               you.  You feel okay, don't you?


               It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't
               be.


               "It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It
               can't be.  I'm not doing anything."
               Just like Harry said before I
               stabbed him with the needle.

     Norman looks at her palm -- SEES the NEEDLE in her hand.  Norman backs
     up, away.


               Don't, Beth.


               But I have to, Norman.


               I promise --


               Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!


               Beth --


               You think I'd belive you?  Believe
               anything you might say now?  After
               you lied to me about telling Barnes
               about my past.  About my problems.  My
               problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine.


               Don't, Beth.  Please.


               It's either this... or I kill you.

     The GUN in her other hand.


               Beth --

     She comes at him, needle in hand... 


               It's your choice.  Because it's not
               safe for you to be awake.  To be
               walking around.  To be thinking about
               things.


               It's not safe for you to be either.


               You think I care?  You think I care
               if I die?
                    
               Would I put explosives around the
               habitat -- set on vibration sensors
               -- that can trigger automatically,
               if I cared about myself?  Would I?
               I've tried twice before, Norman, why
               wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not
               thinking about myself -- No, Norman,
               I'm thinking about you.  Your safety.
               Protecting you from your own self.

     She lunges at him with the needle, missing.  He RUNS for the SPIRAL
     STAIRCASE leading to the lab.  Norman grabs the handrail, begins
     climbing the stairs.

     Beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles.


               Norman!  I'm doing this for you,
               Norman.

     He frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels.


               Norman.

     Climbing, climbing -- round and round -- the STAIRS never seem to end.
     He looks up:

     THE STAIRS -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in
     number.  He climbs, racing, PANTING.  Beth, right behind him, laughing
     almost.


               Come here, Norman.

     She GRABS his ANKLE.  She raises the NEEDLE.  Norman turns, KICKS her in
     the FACE.

     She WAILS, blood SPITTING from her nose.

     Climbing, climbing.  The STAIRS increasing above.  He LUNGES for the top
     step, GRABS it.  Pulls himself up... 



     Scrambling.  He stares down at Beth -- the GUN pointing at him.


               Norman --

     He SLAMS the HATCH DOOR, on top of her, BASHING her head down.  He
     holds the DOOR closed.  Trying to regain his breath.


               This is what I'm talking about,
               Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you.
               This vindictiveness.  This rage.


               Get away from the door, Beth.

     He slides a heavy FILE CABINET over on top of the door.


               Oh, Norman, I don't want to come
               in... 

     The door's METAL PIVOT turns... 



     ON BETH -- on the stairs, spinning the door's WHEEL... 


               ... I want to lock you in.





     Norman staring at the wheel.  CLICK!  It's locked from the outside.

     Norman falls to his knees.  PANTING.





     CLOSE ON A SURVEILLANCE VIDEO CAMERA -- in the upper corner of the
     room.


               You're a psychologist, Norman.  You
               of all people, don't want to admit
               to your shadow side... 





     ON A MONITOR -- WE SEE Norman -- sitting in a corner of the lab,
     staring up at US.


               ... You have a professional stake in
               believing in your own mental health,
               don't you?  Don't you, Norman?... 





     Norman, huddled on the floor.


               Of course you're going to deny it.
               You want to blame someone else.  You
               want to blame Beth.  Because you
               hate Beth.


               Don't fuck with me, Beth.


               I'm not fucking with you, Norman.
               You've fucked yourself.

     Norman JUMPS up, looks at the ground -- WATER on the floor.  Rising in
     level.


               Turn off the water, Beth.

     The entire floor is covered in water, rising higher, and rising fast.


               Beth!


               You're frightened, aren't you,
               Norman?

     Norman, WADING through the water, searching... 


               Where is it coming from, Beth?


               Don't you know?

     Rising higher... 


               Beth, stop it!


               Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not
               me.

     Norman frantically checking for a crack, a leak.


               Then where's it coming from?


               From you, Norman.  From your mind.
               You're doing it.

     It's up to his waist.  He climbs on top a lab bench.  Puts his hands to
     his temples, straining.  WE HEAR Beth laughing.

     A SPECIMEN BOTTLE -- EXPLODES right next to him.


               There's no ventalation in the room,
               Norman.  The pressure's going to kill
               you.

     Another BOTTLE SHATTERS, shooting fragments of glass across the room.


               Stop it!


               It's you, Norman.  Your fear of
               drowning.  You have to face it.

     Microscope lenses CRACK.  Bottles, Test Tubes, Dishes EXPOLDE.


               C'mon, Norman.  Let me put you under.
               Before you kill yourself!



     Bottles floating in the water POP!  The water too high -- Norman
     swimming in it now, keeping afloat.  His FACE strains from the
     pressure.  He looks at the CAMERA in the corner... 


               It's over, Norman.

     Next to the CAMERA, he SEES the HATCH DOOR in the ceiling.


               Don't even think it.  You don't have
               your suit, Norman.  The water will
               freeze you.

     He reaches up at the door.  Can't get it.  The water rising.  He DIVES
     down in the water... 



     He swims to a cabinet near the floor, OPENS it, searches, THINGS
     floating out -- AN OXYGEN CYLINDER and MASK -- he GRABS it.



     NORMAN'S FACE -- bursts above water level, slips on the mask, BREATHES.


               It won't help, Norman.  Your body is
               boyant.  You're gonna shoot right to
               the surface and explode, Norman.
               Don't you get it?  It's over.

     He BREATHES a last breath, reaches up to the ceiling HATCH DOOR, SPINS
     it.


               Norman, what are you doing!  You're
               insa--

     The DOOR opens and WATER gushes inside.  He grabs the frame of the
     door, and his body shoots up through the hole... 





     His body upside down, his hand holding onto the frame.  He grabs a PIPE
     next to it, pulls himself hand over hand, along the pipe.

     HIS FACE -- straining from the freezing chill.

     MOVING along the pipe, hand over hand.  He loses grip.  His body thrusts
     upwards.

     CLOSE ON HIS RIGHT HAND -- purple, frozen, holding onto the pipe.
     Barely gripping.

     HIS FACE -- his eyes fluttering.  He blows air from his mouth, BUBBLES
     burst from his lips.

     HIS BODY slightly descending.

     HIS LEFT HAND -- grips the pipe.  He continues on.

     HAND OVER HAND.  Pulling himself... 



     He SEES the airlock in front of him.

     He SCOOTS along, but slower, now.  He stops.  Can't continue.  He clasps
     his hand to his CHEST, it's burning.  He SEES the airlock.  His eyes
     fluttering, he's losing consciousness.  He can't do it.  And he lets go
     of the pipe.

     FLOATING UPWARDS -- is he gone?

     HIS HEAD -- BANGS into the habitat floor.  His body flat underneath it.
     Being sucked upwards against it.

     He pushes forward... trying to grab the floor with his hands.  He's
     inches from the airlock.

     Plants his feet against the wall -- and pushes forward.  His body
     SUCKED UP and away... 





     ... His head BURSTS above the water level, BIG BREATH.  GASPING.  He
     flails his arms over to the ladder.  Grips the ladder, but his hands
     are like ice.  Can't hold it.  He slips.

     Flailing in the water.

     He HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM.  Twists his legs around, out of
     the water, and flops his body onto the deck.

     Shivering.

     Tries to get up.  Falls over.  His body shaking.  His lips purple.  His
     eyes barely open, looking at... 

     HIS JUMPSUIT -- hanging on the wall.

     Norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.  He reaches
     out for his boots on the floor.  Can't grip them.  Inches his HEAD
     toward his suit, tries to BITE at his suit, but his TEETH chattering.


               I know what you're doing, Norman.
               But you can't save yourself.

     He grips the wall, his hands pulling him up.  He RIPS his suit off the
     hanger.


               It's over, Norman.  It's all over.

     Slipping on his suit, he HEARS a MAN'S voice... 


               Your attention, please.  Your
               attention, please.  All construction
               personnel clear the blast area now.
               Tevac explosives are now activated.
               Countdown beginning.  Mark 15
               minutes, and counting.

     ON NORMAN -- as he slips on his helmet, his teeth -- chattering.



     CLOSE ON THE AIRLOCK HATCH DOOR -- Norman trying to open it.


                    (through Norman's
                    helmet)
               Locked.  Don't try, Norman.  You can't
               get in.  I won't let you in.

     Norman turns, dives back in the water.





     Norman swims out from under the habitat.  Looks around at the
     cylinders, the walls.

     Goes to the outside of a WALL.  Looking for a CRACK, a LEAK, a way in.

     TO HIS LEFT -- Barnes' body, floating, hooked to the wall.

     Norman goes to him.  SEES the CRACK.

     Climbing inside.  Struggling through the CRACK, careful not to rip his
     suit.





     Flooded to the top with water.  Completely filled.  Norman emerges
     through the crack.  MOVES down the hall.



     floats by his faceplate.


               Norman, where are you?  I can't see
               you, Norman.  Tell me where you are.

     Norman pulls at the cylinder's HATCH DOOR.  He HEARS faintly through
     his helmet... 


               Twelve minutes, and counting.

     He OPENS the door.  Slips inside, the water going with him.







     A SCREEN -- flashes: "D CYLINDER HATCH DOOR -- OPEN"

     The CHAIR in front of the console -- spinning, empty.  Beth just left.





     Norman closes the door.  Runs.  Down the corridor... 





     Norman ducks inside.

     THE STRETCHER, the IV -- empty.  Harry's not there.





     ON NORMAN -- running.


               Eleven minutes, and counting.
               Please evacuate.


               Beth?  Can you hear me?
                    
               Beth.



     Norman runs inside... 

     The chair, stopping it's spin.



     THE MONITOR -- flashes: "B CYLINDER -- DOOR OPEN".

     Norman's out the door.





     Norman, running.  SEES the B Cylinder door.  Goes to it.  Spins it,






     Norman climbs inside, takes off his helmet.

     THE CYLINDER -- a maze of pipes and equipment.  Heaters, controls, and
     wires everywhere.  Difficult to see.



     WE SEE NORMAN -- walking through the cylinder.  Holding his helmet at
     his hip.


               Beth?


               Leave me alone, Norman.

     He goes to her voice in the back.  Past pipes, equipment.


               I can't do that.

     ON BETH -- huddled in the back corner, wedged among pipes.  Her eyes
     red.  Holding the GUN in her hand.  Pointing at Norman as he SEES her
     through the pipes.

     ABOVER HER HEAD -- a computer SCREEN, reading: "DETONATION SEQUENCE
     09:32"... descending in count.

     Norman stares up at the SCREEN, concentrating.


               You can't stop it, Norman.  You can't
               fight me.


               I know.  You're too strong, Beth.


               Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman.
               Not now.





               Don't tell me about me.  I already
               know too much.


               Beth -- gimme the gun.


               Oh, sure.  Here.  Anything else, Beth
               can get you?  Some more chicken,
               perhaps.  Let Beth check the fridge.


               C'mon --


               Top shelf, is it?


               Let's get out of here, Beth.  Let's
               go home.

     She sees HER REFLECTION on a PIECE of BROKEN GLASS on the floor.  She
     puts her fingers to her matted hair, tries to comb it.

     Over the intercom... 


               Nine minutes, and counting.


               C'mon, Beth.

     ON THE GUN -- WE SEE Beth's wrists.  The two scars.


               It's over, Norman.  Go on, get outta
               here.

     Norman walks toward her.  Beth freaks... 


               What is that?  What are you doing?


               What?


               You hear that?


               Hear what?


               Get away from me!


               Beth --


               Get away --

     BAM!  From behind her -- Harry -- WHACKS Beth across the head with a
     WRENCH, sending her to the ground.

     Norman goes to her, checking her pulse.


               Did I kill her?


               I don't think so.


               I could hit her a little harder.
               More toward the cranium.

     Norman stares at the NUMBERS on the SCREEN above him.


               If she's still conscious, you can't
               fight her.  You can't stop the
               numbers.

     Over the intercom... 


               Eight minutes and counting.


               Killing her's the only way --


               Hey!  Look!  We didn't kill you,
               alright?  And believe me Harry, I
               would've found great pleasure in
               bashing your head in.

     Norman RIPS off a piece of her t-shirt, ties it to the wound around
     her head.


               Fine.


               Help me lift her.



     Norman, carrying Beth in his arms, races awkwardly down the hall... 


               We're never gonna make it.


               Shut up and open the door.

     Harry does.



     Harry, in his suit now, helps Norman slip on Beth's boots and
     jumpsuit.


               How much time you figure to get to
               the surface?


               Two and a half minutes.  Once we're
               in the sub.


               How far away's the sub?


               Six minutes and counting.


               A little less than six minutes.



     Norman carrying Beth on his back, hurries through the water.


               Five minutes.  I repeat five minutes
               to detonation.







     Norman tries to climb up the ladder with Beth on his back.  She falls
     off, deadweight to the ground.


               Shit.
                    
               Harry!  I'm gonna have to lift her up
               to you.

     Harry leans down from the Sub's airlock... 


               Alright.  Hurry.

     Norman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist.


               I can't reach her.


               Hold on.

     Norman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist.


               Push her, c'mon.


               I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.

     He flops her up again.


               Missed.


               Are you trying, damn it?  Just --


               Four minutes and counting.

     Norman loses grip, drops her.


               Hold on.


               Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.


               I heard!  I heard!

     Picking her up... 


               Three fifty-six, three fifty-five,
               three --


               Shut up and catch.

     Norman flops her up once more, and Harry grabs her AIR HOSE.


               I got her.  I got her.

     Harry pulls her toward the airlock, Norman climbs up after.



     The pocket of air around the sub.  The three of them crammed inside.
     Norman opens the door on top of the sub.


               Alright, here, I'll... wait, you --
               just give her to me.

     Norman takes Beth and pushes her on top the sub.  The sub sways back
     and forth.


               Norman, what are you --

     They lose balance, Beth almost falls, Norman catches her.


               Shit.  Alright, Harry, get in there.

     Harry jumps on top of the sub.  Slides inside it.  Reaches his arms out,
     catching Beth's legs.


               Three minutes and counting... 


               Take her, come on.  Just --

     Beth's LEG swings up and hits Harry in the helmet.


               C'mon, Norman!


               I'm trying to keep balance with --


               Gimme a second --


               Just pull her -- down like inside --
               Harry, work with me here!


               Her legs are in the way.


               You got her?

     Harry pulls Beth down inside, as Norman steps on top of the sub, helps
     push Beth's head inside.


               Get her out of the seat, I need room
               to sit.  Harry?


               I'm trying.  There.


               Two minutes-thirty and counting.

     Norman drops inside.



     Norman in the seat.  Beth's leg hangs over his right shoulder.  Harry
     looks at Norman who assesses the flight controls.


               You know how to work this thing?


               No idea.


               Well, press something!


               Wait!


               Two minutes and counting.


               How long did you say --


               Shut up.  Let me think.

     Norman presses a button.

     THE SCREEN -- blinks: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... "

     Norman hits "ASCEND".  The Sub WHIRRS, RUMBLES and drops down below.

     Norman works the steering wheel, gliding it upwards.



     The SUB comes out from under the dome.  Rising above the habitat... 


               Less than a minute, we're never
               gonna make it.


               Nine hundred feet to surface.


               It's not fast enough, Norman.
               There's a helluva lot of explosive
               down there.



     The sub ascends past the spacecraft tail fin.



     Harry looking down below him... 


               Thirty seconds to detonation.


               The shock wave's gonna crush us,
               Norman.


               Maybe.  Brace yourself.

     Harry just stares at Norman.  Norman grabs Beth, trying to stablilize
     her.


                    
               How's that working out, by the way?


               Good.  Thank you.  Now that I have it
               on.
                    
               Why are you laughing?  You don't even
               know what that means.


               No.  I don't.  But I always said to
               myself, when I die, I want to die
               laughing.

     Harry laughs.

     Ascending... waiting... and then... 

     A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION below them... 

     Rocking the sub, spinning it up and around, surging it upwards to the
     surface.

     THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- RACING toward the surface, toward the
     SUNLIGHT -- it's BLINDING -- and the screen GOES WHITE.





     A pale, white room.

     ON NORMAN -- sleeping.  His eyes begin to open.  He awakes.

     BETH -- is next to him, looking at him.  There is a long beat.


               Thank you.

     Norman looks up at her... 


               You know, I think you really need to
               see a psychologist.

     She stares back at him, and smiles.  Begins laughing with him.



     TWO NAVY CREWMEN stand outside the door, looking in.


               Has anyone spoken to them yet?


                    
               The Admiral's going over the tapes
               they brought up now.


               Does he know yet what really
               happened down there?

     Looking INSIDE -- Norman, Harry, and Beth sit at a table.



     At the table... 


               They're going to want answers and
               they're going to keep asking until
               they get them.


               We can refuse to talk.


               Won't make any difference.  The tapes
               document everything.

     A long beat.


               There is one possibility.


               We all kill ourselves?
                    
               Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.

     She smiles.


               The power allows us to manifest our
               fears, right?  What if we feared the
               power to go away?


               You mean forget?


               It would erase all our knowledge of
               it.  All of our power.


               Would it work?


               Yes.  And I think we already know it
               will.


               How's that?


               Down below, Harry said we would all
               have to die.  Since there was no
               evidence on that spacecraft that
               anybody knew time travel through a
               black hole was possible -- and we
               all knew -- then we would all have
               to die before we could tell anyone.
               Death was the only logical
               explanation.  But sitting here, we
               still know.  So how is that possible?
                    
               Unless we make ourselves forget.



     Norman, Harry, and Beth walk with the CREWMEN.



     The ADMIRAL, 60s, many stripes on his sleeves, sits behind his desk.
     Harry and Beth sit in front of him.  The TAPES on the desk.


               There are some questions that we
               need to address here.


               What about?


               When you were being transferred to
               decompression, Dr. Adams, you
               mentioned something about a squid.


               A what?


               A squid.  However, there doesn't seem
               to be any squid recorded on these
               tapes.


               A squid?  I don't remember anything
               about a squid.
                    
               Did you say something about a squid,
               Harry?

     Harry shakes his head.



     A bright, sunny day.

     ON THE HELIPAD -- the helicopter's propeller begins whirling.



     An OFFICER sits in the passenger's seat, glancing at a clipboard.


               You all ready to go, Dr... ?

     The PILOT from the opening scene... 


               Johnson.  The psychologist.  The one
               that wrote the report.

     ON NORMAN -- in the back.


               What report?
