    THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92


    A radiant shiny something dazzling in EXTREME CLOSEUP.

    CAMERA very slowly PULLS   BACK. The sparkling surface
    turns out to be a lot of   carats. WE SEE the stone, then
    the ring, then suddenly,   in b.g., something HUGE SWEEPS
    by. REVEAL a mechanical    claw above the ring, hanging
    from a crane. The ring    sits in a sea of tiny dolls,
    joke eyeballs, and other   carnival junk.
    The claw descends on the ring again and again, sometimes
    catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it --
    accompanied by OOHS and AAHS  of hope and disap-
    pointment. INTERCUT with the HANDS of a young black man
    working the controls. The EYES of a young black woman
    watching him work. Another guy's HANDS digging in his
    pocket for change. QUARTERS going into the slot.

               This'll never work, Tommy.

               Be positive, Armando. Course it will.
    The claw inadvertently snags a rabbit's foot.

               Look.   See what a lucky fuck I am?

               He don't mean the ring, hon, he
               means the whole plan.


               So do I.
    The claw catches the   ring and closes on it. QUICK CUTS
    of their FACES as the   crane rises. A very pretty lady.
    A beefy Latino with a   two-day beard. Their apprehension.
    Tommy's confidence.    Then his exceptional smile. He gets
    the ring.


               Okay -- one down, one to go.
                      (returning to the
                       claw)
               You got quarters, Loretta?


    THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              2.

    Palm trees. The smell of money. Valets in Foreign
    Legion khakis greeting arriving luxury cars.

    A big crowd of GUESTS at a cocktail reception. A lot
    of lime jackets, cherry trousers, and blue hair. People
    wear name tags.
    ON Tommy, in pastel bow tie and full waiter drag, con-
    firming orders for a group of guests. He speaks in a


             That's a diet ginger ale, an extra-
             spicy virgin mary no salt, a club
             soda -- good choice -- a lime
             rickey, and a bourbon and a
             planter's punch. Five people,
             five drinks... it's Kismet!
    Tommy turns away, looking toward the entrance to the
    room.

    glittering on Loretta's finger. LORETTA, stunning in
    designer clothing and accessories, enters. Her looks
    attract looks.

    Tommy, maintaining his vantage point, repeats another
    order, this time in a heavy CARRIBEAN ACCENT:

             That's a vodka tonic, a Pellegrino,
             lime and no ice, a gin Gibson
             straight up with ex-tra onions
             -- I am also fond of de onions --
             and a Chardonnary spritzer...also
             with extra onions -- no, no, do
             not worry, that is just a little
             joke. There will be no onions
             whatsoever in your spritzer!
    He LAUGHS HUGELY, rather amused with himself.   The guests
    aren't.

             You don't need to write it down?


    THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            3.


             Mr. Memory?   Do not make me laugh!
    He LAUGHS HUGELY, turns, takes two steps away and makes
    absolutely no effort to get their drinks. He looks
    toward the door.

    Loretta approaches the function room, where pert  DEBBIE,
    wearing a JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS button, staffs a  felt-
    covered table. On  a nearby easel, a photo of a  silver-
    haired Man with a legend in blue and gold: JEFF   JOHNSON.



                    
             I'm not too late, am I, dear?
                    
             Hello, darling, Alma Preston,
             how are you today?

             Thanks for coming, Ms. Preston,
             I'm Debbie Bartle.
                    
             Do we have your check yet?
    Loretta pulls a Mont Blanc pen and a checkbook from her
    bag.

             No, honey, I don't think you do, we
             just got in last night from our
             place in Barbados -- how much is it?


             Five hundred a person.   Barbados?

                    
             Yes, we're just down the beach
             from Mick Jagger and Jerry.
                    
             You wouldn't turn down a couple of
             thousand, would you?
    A pleased smile from Debbie. Loretta opens the check-
    book, flashing the immense RING in front of Debbie.

             Um, that's a lovely ring.


    THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              4.


             Oh, thank you. I thought it might
             be a little gaudy...who should I
             make this out to?

             Johnson for Congress. It's not
             gaudy, it's just...nice and big.

             That's my Carlos...I can't even
             look in a store window. We're
             walking down this street in Rio,
             we pass a jewelry store...I didn't
             even turn my head and he's in the
             shop...
                    
             ...$250,000. I said it's crazy...
             but you know Carlos.

             I wish I did.
    ON Tommy watching Loretta. A Guest standing just behind
    Tommy -- wearing MRS. ZEKE BRIDGES name tag -- watches
    JEFF JOHNSON gladhand the room robustly.

             I hear they had him open for six hours.
    ZEKE, a very fat cigar-smoker, marvels at Johnson's
    appearance.

                    
             The sum' bitch looks terrific.

    Tommy, eavesdropping, joins Zeke's chuckle, which unfor-
    tunately turns into a wheeze and then a cough. Zeke
    turns to Tommy.

             How about taking our orders, son?

             Absolutely my friend!    How can I
             pleasure you?

             Bourbon straight up and a Perrier
             rocks for the lady.


    THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             5.


             Ah! Fire and ice! Wonderful!
             But may I suggest you make that a
             double sir? After all, so many
             guests, so few of me -- who knows
             when I may be back?

             Sure, why not.
    AT THE ENTRANCE LORETTA pauses before going into the room.

             You know where the powder room is, hon?
             I should freshen my face before I go in.


             It's just over there.
    ON JEFF JOHNSON with his well-groomed wife, VERA, and a
    barrel-chested Man in full resort wear, wearing an OLAF
    ANDERSEN name tag.

             So how the heck are you, Olaf?

             I should be asking how you are, congressman.
    Johnson pats his chest and smiles at Vera.

             This old ticker never felt better.

             It's good to see you back on your
             feet, Jeff. We need you in Washington.
    Inconspicuously, a pretty young redhead whispers to Vera.
    This is JENNIFER, Johnson's Administrative Assistant
    .

             How's that granddaughter of yours,
             Olaf? Ready for the Olympics?

             She'll be thrilled you asked after her.
8   IN THE HALLWAY Loretta emerges from the Ladies' Room...    8
    catches a spike heel... recovers her balance... then
    frantically searches her hands and clothes, SCREAMS,
    and gets down on hands and knees.


    THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             6.


             My God!    My God! Oh my God!
    Debbie rushes over to her.

             What's the matter?

                      
             My --   my ring. My diamond. I took
             it off   in the ladies' room to wash my
             hands.    I was just putting it on --
             I must   have dropped it.


                    
             Let me help you, we'll find it.

             Call Security!
9   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM Tommy maintains his watch on          9
    Loretta. Zeke Bridges taps Tommy on the shoulder.

             Hey, what about our drinks?
    Tommy instantly assumes an ANGRY YOUNG STREET BLACK


             Yeah?    What you want?

             What?    You already took our order.


             That wasn't me! You must be
             thinking of Jamal. I'm Karim.
             What you want?

             Bourbon straight up and a Perrier
             rocks.

                      
             Hunh.
    He walks two steps...and once again makes no attempt to
    get the drinks. Zeke returns to Jeff Johnson.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             7.


              Don't get me wrong, Jeff. Pyramid
              Insurance doesn't want special breaks.
              I just think we ought to be able to
              set our own rates without Uncle Sam
              sticking his nose in our business.
     Johnson signals Jennifer to come over.

              Do you know my AA? Zeke Bridges,
              this is Jennifer, my Administrative
              Assistant. Zeke's been a
              tremendous help to us. I'd like
              you to listen to his view on health
              insurance.

              I'd be very happy to.

              At Pyramid Insurance, we call our
              approach the Patient's Bill of
              Rights.
10   IN THE HALLWAY Loretta and Debbie are on hands and      10
     knees, still looking. A pair of shoes comes INTO FRAME.
     They LOOK up at a bullet-headed man.

              Ms. Preston?   Bruno Handler, hotel
              security.

              My ring!   My ring! Oh my god...!


              Now just calm down, Ma'am... can you
              describe the ring?

              It's a diamond ring! A big diamond
              ring! Oh my Christ!
     She's frantic.   Debbie takes Bruno aside.

              I saw it. It's huge... it must be
              like eight carats. She says it was
              a quarter of a million dollars!
     Bruno turns back to Loretta, trying to calm her.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             8.


              Ma'am... calm down.   Now, is the
              ring insured?

              Of course it's insured! But you
              know how it works -- if I report
              it, they'll cancel me. And I don't
              want another ring! I need this
              ring! The ring Carlos gave me.
     Bruno turns, speaks into the walkie-talkie he's carrying.

              Where the fuck is housekeeping? I called
              for those dickheads ninety seconds ago.
11   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM the Guests have gathered to hear      11
     Johnson speak. As Andersen introduces him, Tommy con-
     tinues eyeing Loretta.

              Now I won't run through Jeff's
              record -- he's been in Congress
              twenty years, and I've only got two
              minutes. I'll just say this: When
              those of us in pharmaceuticals, or
              agribusiness, or insurance, or
                     
              utilities, or you name it -- when
              we've needed him, Jeff's been there
              for us. And we've been there for
              Jeff, too -- we raised a hundred
              thousand dollars today!

              Without further ado, our man in
              Washington, Jefferson Davis Johnson.
12   IN THE HALLWAY Debbie hears the APPLAUSE .   She     12
     gets up.

              I should be in there. Good luck,
              Ms. Preston. I hope you find it.
     She leaves.   Loretta, mascara smeared, gets up, as
     does Bruno.

              I can't go in there like this. God!
              Please... listen... I'll pay a ten
              thousand dollar reward for anybody
              who finds my ring. Just don't tell
              Carlos!
                     
              He'll kill me.

     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            9.
13   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM, as Johnson takes questions, Tommy    13
     slips out.

              What do you make of all this campaign
              reform business, Jeff?

              Well, y'know Ernie... these days,
              everyone's down on the political
              action committees and so-called
              special interests. But, heck, I
              think you and Fran have a right to
              participate in our democracy in
              exactly the way you're doing today.
              I'm in Congress to represent you.
              I don't want any so-called reform
              to take that power away from you.
14   APPLAUSE . IN THE HALLWAY Bruno issues orders to     14
     two Maintenance Men.

              I want every heating grate opened and
              inspected. I want every air
              conditioning duct vacuumed. Do you
              understand what I'm saying?
     AS he speaks, Bruno SEES Tommy pass through the hallway
     ... spot something on the floor... pick it up... furtive-
     ly put it in his pocket... and walk rapidly toward the
     door to the kitchens.

                     
              Hey, you! Waiter! Hold it right
              there!

     Bruno puts an arm on Tommy. Tommy instantly assumes a
     frantic, wimpy, craven persona, along wth his CARRIBBEAN


              No! Please! Do not report me!
              I will be deported!

              Calm down.   What've you got in your
              pocket?

              I told the CIA everything! I agreed
              to poison the pineapples! My green
              card is in the mail!


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             10.


              Stow it! I'm not Immigration, I'm
              hotel security. Now, what did you
              just put in your pocket?

              Nothing.

              I'm warning you, flathead, get cute
              with me and I will tear you a
              second asshole. Now a valuable
              diamond ring is mising...

              Valuable?
     We can almost see the light bulb click on above Bruno's
     head.

              Very valuable. All right, I'll
              give you a hunnert bucks for it.

              A hundred and five?
     Bruno snorts agreement, goes for his wallet... Tommy goes
     gor the ring... then suddenly leaps back in a cringe!

              No! It's a trick! You will
              call me a thief and send me back
              and the Security Police will make
              me stand on my head in the guano
              pit! I have seen such things on

     Bruno snaps and GRABS TOMMY BY THE COLLAR.

              Jesus, I'm not trying to trick
              you...

              No, no... it is a trap! I must
              turn this over to police.
     He starts to leave.   Bruno grabs him.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              11.


              Listen, dipshit... a valuable ring
              is missing and there's thousands
              of dollars in reward money waiting.
              So you'd better fork over...

              How big is this... reward?
     Another lightbulb.

              Um, five hundred dollars.

              You said 'thousands.'

              Yeah.     Right.    A thousand dollars.

              No, no, no...you said thousands.
              With an 'S'. This is plural.
              This means "two or more thousands."

                     
              Okay, you win. Two thousand.

              Or more.     Two or more.
     Bruno's had enough -- his grip tightens around Tommy's
     neck.

              Just making a point.
15   IN HOTEL LOBBY AT THE CASHIER'S DESK Bruno slides a          15
     check to the Cashier, who counts a stack of bills.
     Bruno picks up a house phone, dials.

     ARMANDO, still unshaven, answers the RINGING phone.

              Hello?
     INTERCUT with Bruno in the lobby.

              Hello, may I speak with Ms. Preston?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              12.


              She's in the bathroom. This is
              Carlos. Can I take a message?

                     
              No, thanks, I'll call back.
     ARMANDO hangs up the phone and exits the hotel room.
     BRUNO crosses to the far side of the lobby, where Tommy
     waits inconspicuously. He gives him the money. Tommy
     gives him ring.

              Now get back to work!
     As Tommy heads back to the function room, Bruno picks up
     a house phone, dials, listens. He dials again, listens.
     No answer. He dials the operator.

              This is Bruno in Security. Put me
              through to 502 -- there must be
              something wrong with the line, I can't
              get an answer... What do you mean,
              there's no one in 502? I just spoke to
              them!... No one's registered in 502? Are
              you sure?... Well, check again!... Shit!
     He hangs up, looks at the ring, and realizes he's been
     taken. His face twisting with rage, he hurries after
     Tommy.
17   ON TOMMY MOVING swiftly through the function room toward 17
     an exit. Zeke Bridges grabs him.


              Hey!   Where the hell are our drinks.
     Surprised, Tommy opts for an EAST INDIAN ACCENT.

              I remember... you were the sloe gin
              fizz and the mango daquiri? With
              perhaps a small umbrella for the lady?

              Bourbon neat and a Perrier, dammit!

              And would you still be wanting the
              umbrella then?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             13.

     As Zeke's face flushes in anger, Tommy SEES Bruno come
     into the room, blood in his eye. Tommy turns sharply and
     heads out the terrace doors to the --

     Tommy conceals himself behind a pillar, across the court-
     yard, away from the Guests. But from another direction,
     Johnson and Andersen approach, arm in arm, and sit on a
     bench by the pillar.

              Olaf, there's something I wanted to
              sound you out on. As a special
              friend.


              Shoot.
     Tommy moves away from the pillar, sees Bruno roaming the
     terrace, and retreats.

              I'm thinking of retiring from
              Congress.
     Andersen's eyes widen in astonishment.

              You're what?

              I'm thinking maybe I won't run.
              Maybe I should listen more
                     
              to this. Really appreciate these
              years. Sail around the world.
              Climb mountains. Enjoy the finer
              things of life.

              Jeff. Listen to me. You can't
              retire. Florida needs you. I need
              you. I need you on rates. I need
              you on regulations. I need you on
              those environmental nutcases --

              Olaf, if I retire this year, I get to keep
              all the money left over in my campaign
              treasury. Comes to a very tidy nest-egg.

              How tidy?

              One-point-three million.
                     
              It's called the grandfather loophole.
     Bruno has gone.   But Tommy stays.   His eyes light up at
     the money.

              Come on, Jeff. Look at what you'd be
              giving up. Going to the best resorts
              in the world and calling it "official
              business." Golfing and skiing and
              fishing, and never picking up a tab.
              And, Jeff -- there's no aphrodisiac
              like power. You can have some of the
              most intelligent, attractive women
              in the country. You've got it made!

              Oh, I suppose that one-point-three
              may seem like spare change to the
              head of Gulf Coast Power, but to a
              country boy like me --

              Okay, Jeff. I get it. Look. There's
              a little software company that's
              about to go through the roof.
     Johnson smiles at the direction the conversation is
     taking.
     ON Tommy also smiling, in admiration at the transaction
     going down.


              A few thousand worth of stock options
              would stand to make you quite a pile.
              As long as your blind trust buys them,
              you're clean -- the SEC can't shake a
              stick at you. Half a million, easy --
              and that's just a start.

              Well, if you put it like that... I
              now see I have a duty to continue
              my career in public service.
     Johnson stands, puts his arm on Andersen.
     Tommy emerges, shakes his head, and laughs.

              I'm in the wrong business.

     A ramshackle bait shack, paint peeling, on the inland
     waterway. At the rear of the shack, Armando shoots hoops
     into a tattered net. Loretta, back in jeans, looks at
     her watch.
     A bondo-patched Econoline van pulls up. Tommy jumps out,
     big smile. He gives Loretta an energetic round of


              The best li'l roper in America!
     But she doesn't want the charm.

              You took your time.

              Cops bust you, Tommy?

              Busted?   Moi?    Fuck no.
     He pulls out the wad of bills.       Their faces brighten
     considerably.

              That look like busted?

     Washington, D.C.   The illuminated dome of the Capitol.

     CAMERA ROAMS the well-hung walls. From the photos and
     memorabilia, we realize that we are in the office of Rep.
     Jeff Johnson.
     In the reflections on the frames, we GLIMPSE some
     MOVEMENT on the desk explaining the considerable
     BREATHING and MOANING .

              Oh my God.     Oh my God. Oh my...
     But then a strange GURGLING sound  escapes from
     Johnson.

               ... God.
     A silent beat.   Then a horrified CRY.      Jennifer rises


              Oh my god!

     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            14B.

     The congregation is SINGING. We SEE the widow Johnson.
     At her side, in the aisle seat, a powerful man with bushy
     eyebrows, about 60, in a three-piece suit and watch
     chain: congressman DICK DODGE. The HYMN ends. Dodge
     steps up to the pulpit.

              It was my honor to serve in Congress with
              Jeff Johnson for a generation. No one
              could have been a better legislator. No
              one could have been a finer husband and
              father. And now --
     He presses the tips of his fingers together and looks
     skyward, as if communing with his memory of the deceased.


              And now God has called his servant home.
     ANGLE ON Jennifer, in black.

              We will miss him. But we are grateful
              that his passing was so peaceful -- and
              so like him -- working late into the
              night at his desk, the consummate
              public servant.




     Vera sneaks a look at Jennifer, who is poker-faced.

     On the veranda of the gracious  home, mourners pay
     respects to the family. Dodge   puts a gentle hand on
     the widow's shoulder and draws  her aside. He throws
     a look at Jennifer, who joins  them.

              Vera, I know you're still in shock
              from Jeff's... passing. But we have
              to talk about his seat.
     Vera stares at Jennifer.   She knows the score.


              Mrs. Johnson, if you'd like to
              discuss this in private --

              You can stay -- what's the
              difference?

              Vera, I'd like you to announce that
              you're going to run for Congress.
              Let a few days pass to show proper
              respect. But next week, I want to
              stand next to you at a press
              conference where you declare for
              Jeff's seat in the House.

              No, Dick -- no.


              There's nothing to be afraid of,
              Vera. With your name, you can't
              lose. People around these parts
              are so used to voting for Jeff
              Johnson -- why, Mrs. Jeff Johnson
              would win in a walk.

              Dick, I was a Washington wife for
              twenty years. Twenty years of
              Potomac bullshit is plenty for one
              lifetime.

              Vera, we're talking about becoming a
              Member of Congress. We're talking
              about a sure thing.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              16.


               Don't worry about running the
               office -- I'll be there night
               and day.

               I'm sure you would, dear. But I
               couldn't give you the same job
               satisfaction Jeff gave you.
     Jennifer, embarrassed, didn't know Vera knew.    Nor
     did Dodge.



     A retirement community in the Florida sunshine.

     open. A supermarket shopping cart full of groceries,
     tied with a big bow, rolls out, pushed by Tommy. Loretta
     accompanies him.
     Tommy BUZZES at a door. It's answered by Tommy's
     GRANDMA, a limber lady in leggings and a bright top.
     She sees the groceries, kisses him.

               This is very sweet of you, darling.
               But you shouldn't have done it.
               Where did you get the money?

               You don't want to know.


     Tommy and Loretta are watching the track results on the
     local tv news. Tommy, playing solitaire, shuffles bril-
     liantly. Grandma comes in from the kitchen, shaking
     her head.

               How did I end up with a thief
               for a grandson?

               Grandma -- I told you.    I'm not a
               thief. I'm a con man.     An artist.

               But also a crook.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             17.


               But I only con crooks, Grandma.
               You can't con an honest man. Only
               somebody who wants something for
               nothing.
                      
               But the good Lord must have been
               fond of pigeons, because he made

               Sometimes I just wish you were
               more like your Daddy...

               You mean, dead?

               No, smartmouth... I mean someone
               who made something of himself.

     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               18.

     Loretta gets up and goes for the kitchen. We hear a
     high-pitched ELECTRONIC WARBLE. Tommy reaches into
     Loretta's purse and pulls out a cellular phone.

                         
              See?      I told you TV advertising
              works.
     He opens the phone and speaks in a toneless, recording-
     like voice.

              Hello...you have reached Girls of
              Many Nations. For Hot Blooded

              Bingo! Loretta...guy wants to
              speak to Inga.

                      
              Tell him to call back.      I'm

     TOMMY grins mischievously and speaks into the phone in
     the husky voice of a SWEDISH WOMAN.

              Ja, this is Inga. Hello Paul...
              how are you tonight? You are
              feeling naughty? That's all right
              ...you have your what in a bowl of
              oatmeal? Yes, that is very
              naughty, and maybe a little sick.

              Oh NO! It's my husband Lars.
              He's home early, I must go before
              ...you want to talk to Lars too?
              So you like to talk dirty out of
              both sides of your mouth.
                     
              Man, you are one twisted bastard!
     Laughing, he hangs up.

              Tommy, please!

              Sorry, grandma, just getting a
              third minute out of him.
     He clicks off the phone and slams it back into Loretta's
     purse. Loretta, meanwhile, has reappeared.

              You hung up on Paul? He's one of
              my best customers.

              I can't believe any relative of
              mine does that for a living.

              C'mon Gramma...it's only my voice.
              They never actually meet me.

              So my granddaughter talks dirty
              for a living and my grandson's a
              thief.

              What's up, Grandma? Are you
              embarrassed to show my picture
              around the pool?

              Of course I'm not. Look.
     She goes to her sewing basket and pulls something from
     it. She unfolds it: a long piece of needlepoint she's
     been working on.

     It spells out Tommy's full name:   Thomas Jefferson
     Johnson.

              Look what these arthritic hands
              been doing.


              Make me proud of you, Tommy. Make
              me proud of the name you carry.
     In the silence between them that follows, we HEAR the tv.

              I'm Ned Grable, vice president and
              general manager of WFLA. We think
              Mrs. Jeff Johnson did the right
              thing in not running for the
              congressional seat left vacant by
              her husband's death.
     The editorial catches Grandma's attention.

              Jeff Johnson's name may still be magic.
              But it'll take more than the magic of
              name recognition to solve our region's
              problems. I'm Ned Grable.

              Name recognition. Lordy, what a
              notion. People have to be some
              boobs just to vote for someone
              because their name is Johnson.
     Tommy's eyes widen.

              I remember once back in Georgia,
              they even elected a dead man. His
              name was still on the ballot --
              people were just used to voting
              for him.

              What did you say, Grandma?

     Up by the racks of junk food and beer, and pails of fish
     slop, Tommy and Armando await Homer. In b.g., an older
     black gentleman plays checkers, solo. This is VAN DYKE.

              What's this about, jefe?

                     
              Loretta! Get off the damn phone!

              This better be good.

                     
              "This better be good." Loretta!
     ON LORETTA on the pay phone, moaning in Swedish ecstasy.

              Oh, ya, ya, God, you're so big!
                     
              Uh-oh, I have to go now, my
              husband Sven is home early...
     Tommy grabs the phone.   He pushes aside a protesting
     Loretta...

              Goddammit, Inga, is it that
              pervert again! Damn!
     He smacks the receiver with his hand.

                     
              Listen, you little shit -- I just
              spent eight years in the joint,
              nobody talks to my woman like
              that! I got your adress, I got a
              machete, I got two Rotweilers...
              I'm gonna come to your house and
              tear your ass up!
                     

              Okay, Tommy, what's so damn
              important?

              Yeah, I got work to do.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            21.

     They all look at him expectantly. He takes a dramatic
     pause, then launches into a "Come to Jesus" speech.

              My friends, I want to tell you
              about a town where the streets are
              paved with gold. This is a town
              where the marks give you money
              before you ask. A town where they
              take you to dinner after you fuck
              'em. A town where when they need
              money, they just print more. This
              is a town where a guy bounced nine
              hundred checks and he didn't even
              have to skip town!!!


              Ain't no town like that.

              You mean Vegas?

              No.
                     
              Washington, D.C.   I'm going to run
              for Congress.
     His big smile meets their blank surprise.   Their faces
     fall.

              What is this, a joke?

              I don't get it.


              What's the con, Tommy?

              Van Dyke.   You remember Willie
              Sutton?

              Of blessed memory.

              You remember what he said? They
              asked him, Why do you rob banks?
              And he said, That's where the money
              is. I tell you, people -- Washington.
              That's where the money is.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            22.

     Tommy produces a sheaf of Xeroxes and pamphlets.

              I found this shit in the library.
              You know how much a congressman
              makes? A hundred and thirty a year
              -- and that's just base pay for
              getting your ass elected. Then
              there are these things called PACs,
              and these lobbyists, whose whole
              point in life is to buy you off.
              It's the con of a lifetime -- and
              the damn thing is, it's legal!
              This is hot, people, we can do this!


              Who "we," white man?

              You never heard of staff, Armando?
              I get in, I get a staff allowance
              of five hundred and thirty-seven
              grand a year --
     Loretta wolf-WHISTLES.

              -- which I will generously share
              with you.

              And how exactly were you going to
              get your butt to Congress?

              Yeah -- why would anyone vote for
              you?

              Not for me, Homer. For Jeff
              Johnson. Name recognition -- that's
              what it's all about. You think
              folks know their congressman died?
              I get on the ballot as Jeff Johnson,
              I guarantee they'll vote for me.
              Now all's I have to do is get on the
              ballot.

              Which is how?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           23.


              Which is where you folks come in.
                     (picking up a ream
                      of forms)
              All's we have to do is collect
              five thousand six hundred
              twenty five signatures.

              You shittin' us?

              In your dreams, Tommy.

              You people got a better idea?

              I do.

     Senior citizens fold brochures, stuff envelopes, make
     phone calls. Van Dyke and Tommy enter.


              Okay... gimme the four-one-one on
              these Silver Foxes Again. It's a
              bunch of old folks who like to
              vote?

              Don't laugh, they get an enormous
              turnout. But the big thing is,
              they have their own line on the
              ballot. They already got the
              signatures.

              Ah.

              The lady we're meeting, Hattie
              Rifkin, they call her the condo
              queen.

              So all I have to do is snow one
              old lady. Don't sound like major
              surgery.

     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            24.

     Tommy and Van Dyke are seated opposite HATTIE RIFKIN, a
     high-energy woman, 70s, with a frizz of white curls.

              So, what brings you here?   You want
              to talk politics... talk!

              We were wondering who you were going
              to run for Congress this year.

              Oh, the usual sacrifical lamb.
              Probably Sylvia Roland. She just
              lost her husband, she needs to meet
              new people. Why?

              Mrs. Rifkin... I want to run.

              Well, I want to run too -- but with
              this plastic hip, it's not gonna
              happen.
     Tommy breaks up.   In spite of himself, he's charmed by the
     salty old babe.

              What I mean is... I'd like to run
              for Congress on the Silver Fox
              ticket. I care about you and your
              issues.

              Yeah, that's what my son says. But
              does he call? Anyway, what makes
              you think a group of alter cockers
              are gonna support a man who hasn't
              clipped his first nose hair yet?

              Because I can win.

              No, no... a Democrat can win. A
              Republican can win. A Silver Fox
              can only make a symbolic point.

              Mrs. RIfkin, if you give me a ballot
              line, and if I can get support
              from...


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            25.


              If... if. Ven die bubbah halla
              tsehen qulishkes, het gehaya zadeh.

              Sure, but... besser die viller ein
              der kenner.
     Hattie cracks up.   Tommy leans over and translates for
     Van Dyke:

              She said, 'If my grandmother had
              balls, she'd be my grandfather.'


                     
              Where the Hell did you learn to
              speak Yiddish?

              The same place I learned to hustle
              shtarkers at gin rummy. From Morris
              Elfbein... the Gin King of Miami
              Beach.

              No kidding... you knew the Rudolf
              Valentino of Dade County?

              He taught me a great deal. He
              taught me you don't always need the
              best cards to win.

              Maybe not in gin, but in politics,
              young man, you need money to win,
              you need a name to win, you...

              Oh, I have a name.

              What, you're an athlete, a movie
              star? I don't get out as much as
              I used to. You're not on MTV, are
              you?

              No ma'am. My name is Johnson.      Jeff
              Johnson. The Name You Know.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92                26.

     She ponders for a minute.    And then she gets it.   A
     wicked smile.

              Jeff Johnson. Well,     that's a name
              even our Alzheimer's    Group will
              remember.
                     
              Still, for a full-up    campaign, we'd
              need materials, we'd    need ads...

              You leave that to me, Mrs. R.


     The widow Johnson is pouring tea for Tommy, now in super-
     nerd drag -- wire-rim glasses and tweed sport jacket.

              I'm not sure I understand, Professor
              Franklin -- you wrote your doctoral
              thesis on my husband?

              He was a great man, Mrs. Johnson.
              He did so much for my people.

              He... did?

              Oh, yes. I'll never forget when he
              said 'Welfare is a drug -- and you
              gotta kick it cold turkey.' It
              was... inspirational.


              Really... well, I'm sure...

              And I was actually in the audience
              when he said, 'If you people would
              just get off your dead asses and
              look for work, this country might
              be fit to live in again.' Powerful
              stuff.

              It's very kind of you to say so.
              And you're very kind to come all
              the way from... where was it?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            27.


              Wilson-Pickett State Teachers College.
              But I didn't just come to pay
              respects, ma'am. I came because
              your husband deserves an archive.
              A place where scholars can study
              his legacy. A storehouse for the
              record of his remarkable career.

              I see.   So you want... his papers?

              Oh, not just his papers, Mrs.
              Johnson. Everything. Buttons,
              posters, bumper stickers. All the
              paraphernalia of his campaigns --
              proof of his political genius. Now
              I realize that you may have a
              sentimental attachment to a few
              items...

              Take 'em.

              I beg your pardon.

              Take 'em all. Would you like the
              wedding photos, too?

              Well, I don't think that's necess...

              Good -- that way you won't have to
              go rooting around in the garbage.
              Is there anything else?

              Well, um... no.

              More tea?   Or something stronger?
              I know it's  only ten-thirty, but,
              hell, sun's  over the yardarm
              somewhere,  right?

              Actually, ma'am, I should be getting
              back.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            28.


              You're in pretty good shape for a
              professor. D'you work out?
     Tommy rises and packs his briefcase hastily.

              Look, I, um, have a class to
              teach. You know how blind
              students are... they're so
              dependent.
                     
              Don't worry ma'am... your
              materials will be in good hands.

     Van Dyke, Armando, and Homer have a production line going,
     doctoring the old Johnson campaign materials, slicing off
     and painting out the RE-'s and the years.

              Are you sure you don't want to come
              to Washington with us, Homer?

              Voters? Sorry, Mr. Johnson won't be
              attending the debate. No -- no,

              No, you can't, Mr. Johnson has just
              had surgery for a deviated septum.

              We're not going to show you Jeff
              Johnson waving a flag. We're not
              going to show you Jeff Johnson
              kissing babies. We're not going
              to show you Jeff Johnson doing
              anything, because you already
              know what Jeff Johnson can do.


     The poster fills the screen.


              Tomorrow, vote for Jeff Johnson.
              The name you know.
     A very puzzled Vera Johnson watches the ad on tv.

     The congressional district sleeps. But   in the darkness,
     a kind of D-Day onslaught is under way.   QUICK SUPER-
     IMPOSED CUTS of Tommy's secret army of  Silver Foxes,
     opening crates, fanning through parking  lots, swarming
     over lawns, driving in stakes, tacking  up posters
     everywhere.
     INCLUDE Tommy climbing a telephone pole... Armando shinnying
     up a light pole across the street... Loretta and Van Dyke
     pulling on a rope... which hoists a huge bundle to Tommy...
     who opens and unfolds it... and gets an end through the
     air to Armando. They unfurl the biggest banner imaginable.



     CAMERA TILTS DOWN. Every square    inch of town seems to
     have been plastered with JOHNSON   FOR CONGRESS material.
     It's on billboards, bumpers, bus   shelters, balloons,
     banners, utility poles... all in   the late congressman's
     signature design.

     The Econoline, now a JOHNSON ad on wheels, ghetto-blasters
     mounted front and back on the roof, rolls by a Jewish deli
     ...a soul food joint... a whitebread country club... a
     Chinese restaurant... At each, Tommy's amplified VOICE says:


       THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             30.


                 Jeff Johnson.    The name you know.
       In a different appropriate accent.

       In front of a polling place, Van Dyke pulls up in a hearse
       with an ELECT JOHNSON banner. So, driving muscle cars, do
       Armando, Homer, and Loretta -- Tommy's get-out-the-vote fleet.
       Exhilarated senior citizens pile out, led by Hattie.

       An ordinary Couple, 40s, sign the registration book, then
       enter adjacent voting carrels. After a moment, the
       HUSBAND leans out.

                 Who are we voting for Congress?

                 Don't we always vote for Johnson?

                 That's it -- Johnson.

     The small crowd -- Tommy's cronies, their pals, and a
     jubilant contingent of Panthers led by Hattie -- lets
     out a great WHOOP.

                 Is that him? Tricia, I believe
                 Congressman-elect Johnson is
                 coming this way.
     For the first time, we see Tommy wearing a beautifully-cut
     suit. He's instantly engulfed by lights, cameras, and
     Supporters.
     An amazed CAMERAMAN, watching Tommy, whispers to a Producer.


                 Jesus -- he's not... white. I
                 actually voted for the guy. I
                 thought he was Jeff Johnson.
     Tommy jumps onto a bench.    APPLAUSE from his Supporters.

                 Thank you, thank you, all of you,
                 for your help. Give yourself a
                 round of applause.
     They do. As APPLAUSE continues , CAMERA PANS from
     Reporter to Reporter to Reporter, their mikes bearing the
     call-letters of different channels.

                 I've never been so proud in all
                 my life. He was always such a
                 good boy...well, I think he meant
                 well. Sometimes -- well he was a
                 clean child. That's important, I
                 think...

                 a guy named Kennedy who got

                 Kennedy.

              A lot of dead incumbents get
              re-elected, actually. It's an
              American tradition.
     ON Tommy. Speaking meaningfully, with great sincerity,
     he shows a gift for political discourse.

              We ran a positive campaign. We
              campaigned on the issues. The
              issue is leadership. Leadership
              for the future. Ask not what you
              can do for your country. The
              people have spoken. The only
              thing we have to fear is fear
              itself. If you can't stand the
              heat stay out of the kitchen.
              Live Free or Die. And in
              conclusion...read my lips!

              Congressman Johnson! Congressman
              Johnson!
     Tommy looks. It's REINHHARDT, a young straight-arrow
     bearing two huge document briefcases, which he puts down
     to shake hands.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              33.


               Arthur Reinhardt. You remember me
               -- I Fed-Exed that material to you
               in Key West?

               Reinhardt, my man! Of course!
               You look just like I pictured you.
               Nice wing tips.

               Thank you. Congressman, I hope you
               don't think I'm out of line for
               meeting you here -- I thought you
               might want some help with logistics,
               settling in at your hotel --
                      (indicating the
                       briefcases)
               Since you didn't make it to the
               Harvard seminar, I put together a
               set of their papers for you.

               I like your initiative, Reinhardt,
               but to tell you the truth, I've
               never been much of a student. Maybe
               you can brief my staff sometime.
     Reinhardt looks Tommy's cronies over.     Not your classic
     Hill types.

               But thank you, I will take you up on
               those logistics. Hey! Entourage!
               What hotel we at?

     They look at one another, puzzled.

               Reinhardt, it appears that the
               staff has neglected to nail down
               some details.

               Oh, Jesus, the IMF's in town.    Where
               are we going to find a room?

               Four rooms.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              34.

     The entourage is enjoying a round of libations.
     Reinhardt runs up.

              I got lucky at the Madison. Thank
              god there's been a coup in
              Uruguay. Their delegation just
              checked out.

              You're a wizard, Reinhardt.    I
              knew you could handle it.


     Tommy's entourage and their luggage are being packed into
     a cab. Tommy turns to Reinhardt.

              So when does the House open for
              business?
     Reinhardt hasn't heard it put quite that way before.
     Reinhardt gets his courage up.

              Say, Congressman, you got my
              resume, didn't you?

                     
              I'm sure I did.

              There's something I wanted to ask you.
              I know it's a big step, but -- I'd
              like you to consider me to be your AA.

              That's quite an offer, Reinhardt,
              very decent of you, but I'm just a
              social drinker.

              No. AA. Your Administrative
              Assistant. I worked for
              Congressman Johnson. I'd like to
              work for you, Congressman Johnson.

              Really.
     Tommy looks at his own troops, then back to Reinhardt.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            35.


               You mean like an affirmative
               action thing?
     Tommy opens the cab door.

               Tell you what -- I'll think about
               it, okay?
     Tommy gets in and closes the door.

                      (through the open
                       window)
               Thanks for getting us settled,
               really appreciate it.
                      
               Madison Hotel.


     The bridge over the Potomac has a classic view of the
     Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. Their
     taxi drives by.




     Morning. Tommy and cronies get out of a cab and bound up
     the grand flight of stairs. In b.g., the Capitol dome.


     They walk the superb ground floor corridor of Cannon,
     salivating. Marble columns... chandeliers... grand
     offices. Real class.
     AT AN ELEVATOR with a sign above it -- MEMBERS ONLY --
     they stop. Tommy presses the button. The door opens.
     The seated ATTENDANT gets a load of this group.
     Especially Loretta.

               Sorry, folks, this elevator's
               for Members only.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             36.


              That's okay, they're with me.
              Sixth floor please. Cannon 609.
              I'm going to my office.

              I said Members only.

              I am a Member. Now take us to six
              before I haul your ass in front of
              the committee on disrespectful
              behavior.

              Elevator don't go to six. You
              have to get off at five and walk.

     Looking puzzled, they make their way up a drab stairwell.

     Not classy. On one side of the hallway, the windows give
     out on a brutally ugly courtyard. On the other side of
     the hall are cages: windowless storage bins behind metal
     fences crammed with junk -- and an occasional xerox
     machine, Mr. Coffee, and pitiful staffer at a tiny desk.
     Tommy opens the door to 609.

     Tommy's office is a small, dark garret, with dirty car-
     peting, bare shelves, and a pile of bulging canvas U.S.
     Mail bags.


              Wait here.
     He heads further into the office.

     Equally unattractive.   Perched on the desk:   Reinhardt.

              You again!

              Good morning, congressman.

              What is this shithole?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             37.


              Excuse me?

                      
              This.

                     
              Oh -- you missed the freshman   lottery
              for offices. They assign them    by
              draw. You didn't show for the    draw,
              so you got the worst office in   Congress.

              I missed what lottery?

              It was all in the briefing books I
              mailed you.

              What else did I miss, Reinhardt?

              Are you hiring me, congressman?
     Tommy gives Reinhardt a good once-over, seeing him anew.

              You're shaking me down, aren't you?
     Tommy laughs, then clasps Reinhardt's shoulders.

              This is fantastic, Reinhardt. I
              haven't been here five minutes,
              and you're shaking me down. God,
              I'm gonna love this town. You're
              hired, man. Just tell me what to
              do next. I don't want to miss out
              on any of the good shit.

              The dinner for new Members is
              tonight, at Union Station. Do you
              have black tie?
     BEGIN elegant, spirited classical MUSIC.

     With its hundred-foot barrel-vaulted ceiling and grand
     windows, the magnificent Beaux-Arts station has been
     beautifully restored.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             38.

     A big crowd slowly makes its way along a red carpet to
     the party.
     Tommy was born to wear a  tux. In his  lapel, a red-and-
     gold eagle pin. On his   arm, Loretta, in a dramatic
     shoulderless and nearly  backless gown, with three-quarter
     gloves. The other Women   in sight are far more conserva-
     tively dressed.

     A STRING QUARTET provides the music. Tommy and Loretta
     linger uncertainly near the entrance. Then:

              Let's meet some natives.
     Tommy leads her over to two Men, 30s, excellent haircuts.
     Both wear pins. He extends a hand.

              Tommy Johnson, how'd you do, nice
              party, heck of a railroad
              station, isn't it?

              Rafe Simon, freshman from Tulsa.
              And this is Bo Chandler --

              -- from Lufkin, Texas. You must
              be the one who didn't come to Harvard.

              No, I couldn't, it was my Princeton
              reunion....


              Jeff Johnson? You're Jeff Johnson?
              The guy from Florida?

              That's right.

                     
              The rest of us are out there on the
              campaign trail, raising money,
              kissing ass, making speeches,
              dragging our butts from place to
              place -- and he slides in on pure
              name recognition!


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            39.

     He puts his face close to Tommy.

              Let me tell you something, Jeff.
     A tense beat.   Then Rafe breaks into a smile.

              Fuckin' brilliant.
     Bo winks at Tommy.
                            Tommy
              Thank you. Thank you both very much.
                     
              Isn't that nice, now, don't you think?
                     
              This is Miss Loretta, boys.
     She extends a regal hand to each, Liza Doolittle at the
     ball.

              How do yo do.    How do you do.

              And it's Tommy. My friends call
              me Tommy. "Jeff" is my...
              professional name. So what line
              of work were you boys in before
              you got elected? You lawyers or
              something?

              Oh, no, I did morning weather and
              traffic for KTOK in Tulsa.


              You don't remember me? I was a tight
              end for the Oilers -- my knee gimped out.
     The origins of the gentlemen's political success is not
     lost on Tommy.

              Hey, stop by my reception after
              the swearing in tomorrow, okay?

              Yeah, but don't you go to his
              reception before you go to my
              reception.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            40.


               Fine, but I'm gonna be real
               offended if either of you miss my
               reception.
      They leave.

               I think we have to have a
               reception.
      AT THE BUFFET, as Tommy and Loretta help themselves
      generously to oysters and champagne, they overhear TWO
      MEMBERS passing by.


               So then I ran an ad calling him a
               draft dodger, but then he ran an
               ad calling me a plagiarist.

               What did you do?

               Oh, leaked a rumor that his father-
               in-law was a Nazi. I went up ten
               points in a weekend.

                      
               We're in the majors, doll.
62A   THE BALCONY is full of people working one another. As      62A
      Tommy and Loretta pass some large stone statues, a man
      extends his hand -- liquor lobbyist KEN KORNGOLD.


               Congressman? I'd like to introduce
               myself. Ken Korngold. National
               Distilled Spirits Association.

               Tommy Johnson. Distilled Spirits,
               is that right?

               It's super that you won, congressman.
               Any way we can help, please don't hesitate.

               Pleasure's all mine, Ken, hope you
               can make it to my reception. Do
               you happen to have a card?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             41.


                      
               I sure do.

      Tommy is along a wall where other guests are similarly
      occupied.

               You now what I love about this place?
               The way everyone calls you a
               Member.  Every time I hear that,
               it makes me think of Mr. Happy
               here.

      The Member next to him bursts out laughing.

               Don't you be peeing on my shoe.
      They go to the sinks.    The Member introduces himself.

               Mike Strangland. Iowa -- first CD.

               You got a CD?    Shit, I missed
               that, too.

               First Congressional district.

               Ohhh. Tommy Johnson. Florida.
               So Iowa -- how'd you get to
               Washington? You do the crop
               report on tv?
      IOWA has a big open face and a flat Midwestern voice.

               No -- I owe it all to the Vietnamese.

               P.O.W. When I got back to Cedar Rapids,

               they finally told me to put up or shut
               up -- so I put up. And here I am.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              42.


              Wait a minute. What's wrong in
              Washington?

              C'mon -- there's acid rain killing
              fish, and no one's stopping it...
              there's topsoil washing away, and no
              erosion program... there's chemicals
              in our livestock -- God, I sound like
              a Boy Scout.

              That's alright, Iowa -- this place
              could use a few geeks like you.

              Hey... thank you... nice to see
              you... hope you can make it to my
              reception. Have y'all met Miss
              Loretta?
     TOMMY'S TABLEMATE is lawyer-lobbyist TOMMY O'CONNOR, 40s.
     As Waiters serve lobster bisque, he hands TJ a business
     card.

              Tommy O'Connor. Soon as I saw how
              you got elected, I knew you were a
              real comer. Hell, I bet old Olaf
              Andersen voted for you.

              Who's Olaf Andersen?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             43.

     O'Connor points.    ON THE DAIS, Andersen is engrossed with
     Dodge.

              I won't tell him you asked.
              Chairman of Gulf Coast Power.
              Constituent of yours, client of
              mine.


              Pays the rent, know what I    mean?
              Say, could I host a little    welcome-
              to-Washington thing for you    down at
              my law firm? Meet some of     my clients,
              five hundred a head -- you    could
              pick up twenty, twenty-five    grand
              to get you started.

                     
              And how much of that do you get?

                        
              Oh,    it doesn't come off the top.
              Down    the road, I'll bill 'em each
              five    hundred an hour whenever I
              take    you to lunch.

              Tommy, I think this is the beginning
              of a beautiful relationship.


     making a speech from the dais.

              Tonight we unite the two great
              pillars of our system -- political
              and financial. To the forty-four
              newly-elected Members of Congress,
              I say, Look around you tonight.
              Look around, and be thankful for
              the generosity.
     Tommy inspects the sea of barracudas.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            44.


              The people you see not only provided
              tonight's hospitality. They are the
              people you serve. That's our system
              of checks and balances at its best.
              Their support helped get you
              elected... your work will help
              them... and their support will help
              you in your next campaign, which I
              remind you is already less than two
              years away.

     In b.g., the Capitol dome. As Tommy and Loretta leave,
     they pass Dick Dodge, who is saying goodnight to guests.
     He stops them.

              You know, Mr. Johnson, it's
              customary for new Members to pay a
              courtesy call on the old fogies in
              the leadership. Especially from
              their HOME STATE.

              Well, I would have, but I just got
              to town. It's an honor to meet you,
              sir. A real privilege. This is
              Miss Loretta.

              Public liaison.
     She pronounces the word so carefully, it sounds lewd.


              How do you    do?
                     
              You could    make up for it by having
              a nightcap    with me.
                     
              May I have    my car take you home?

     Tommy and Dodge walk up steps toward the Capitol.

     A darkened hallway. A hand-lettered sign by a door reads

     DODGE. Tommy and Dodge approach. As Dodge unlocks the
     door:


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            45.


              Excuse me, Mr. Chairman, but this
              ain't no homo shit we up to, is it?

              No.  No, it's not. But --
                     
              Good thinking, Johnson. I'm
              impressed by your instincts.

     A single table lamp lights Dick Dodge's office, reflecting
     off the velvet drapes, sculpted ceiling, and crystal
     chandeliers. Tommy and Dodge are in leather armchairs,
     ties undone. On the table between them, a bottle of Jim
     Beam. Dodge casts a cool eye on Tommy.

              Tell me, Johnson. Why did you come
              to Washington?

              Well... of course... it's a chance
              to do something for my country. I
              mean, there's the topsoil thing, and
              acid rain is killing the cattle --

              Cut the bullshit, Johnson. I saw how
              you got elected. Flukes like you are
              either nutcases or troublemakers.
              I just want to know which one I have
              on my hands. Who sent you here?

              No one sent me.

              You pulled off that upset on your
              own?

                     
              Kid's got his talents.

              I'm impressed, Johnson, I am.     But
              why did you run for Congress?

              No bullshit?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              46.


              No bullshit.

              Opportunity knocks.    This town is
              the fuckin' Yukon.
     A stunned silence from Dodge -- then deep and generous
     laughter.

              What a refreshing answer.
     He laughs again, richly amused.   Tommy joins in the
     laughter.


     Shining in the bright sun.

     Hundreds of business cards. An expert riffle, a one-
     handed cut, and Tommy deals lightning fast, a perfect
     diamond formation with two cards in the middle. He turns
     them over one at a time.

              Food... drinks.

                     
              Ken Korngold, National Distilled
              Spirits Association. Bob Rafferty
              ...Wisconsin Cheese Board.
                     
              What do you want me to do?

              You're on cheese. I'll handle
              booze.
     He reaches for the phone...

     Pan from Capitol Hill to gleaming glass office building.

                     
              Ken! Ken Korngold! Tommy Johnson
              here... Right -- last night. How's
              it going, big guy?

              Congressman!

     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            47.

     Expensive furniture, rugs, and art.

              How are you on this helluva fine
              day! I'm looking forward to your
              reception.


              Actually, that's why I'm calling,
              Ken. You said if I needed some
              help --

              You name it, congressman. Issue
              papers, testimony, floor speeches --

              Tell you what I have in mind. I
              was just thinking, wouldn't it be
              a plus for old Ken Korngold if I
              was to -- how should I put this --
              showcase some of his distillers'
              products at my reception? You know,
              like they put Reese's pieces in
              E.T.? It's called "product
              placement." People come in, they
              have a tremendous time, they see
              your products, they think well of
              you -- and they think well of me,
              too. It's good for both of us,
              Ken. What do you say?

              Well, it's a new one on me, but
              hey, sure, I think we can help you
              out.  Say, while I have you on the
              line, there was one thing...

     The SPEAKER administers the oath of office to the
     assembled House.

              Do you solemnly swear that you
              will support and defend the
              Constitution of the United States...
     ON GRANDMA next to Tommy, eyes welling with pride. It's
     the one day a year that non-Members 
     can be on the floor.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              48.


              ... against all enemies, foreign and
              domestic; that you will bear true
              faith and allegiance to the same...

     The 435 Members  taking the oath, watched
     on C-span by Loretta, Armando, Van Dyke, and Reinhardt.

              ... that you take this obligation
              freely, without any mental
              reservation or purpose of evasion...


     ON IOWA taking the oath, his toddler in his arms.     PAN
     along faces of other Members... to Tommy.

              ... and that you will well and
              faithfully discharge the duties
              of the office on which you are
              about to enter. So help you God?

              I do.

              Congratulations. You are now
              Members of Congress.
     Sustained APPLAUSE.   Tommy kisses Grandma.
     INTERCUT Tommy's cronies APPLAUDING.

     ON THE FLOOR Tommy dries Grandma's tears with a finger.

              It's just that -- I'm so happy you
              straightened out.
     Tommy smiles ambiguously. As APPLAUSE continues, his
     eyes roam the room and make contact with Dick Dodge,
     standing at one of the leadership tables. Tommy winks
     conspiratorially at him. There's such diabolical glee in
     it, it even takes Dodge aback.

     A beautiful black woman, 20s, walks briskly down the
     busy Cannon corridors. CELIA. There's intelligence in
     her eyes, and fire.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            49.

     She makes her way down the corridor,
     exchanging AD LIB greetings, glancing in at the sedate
     receptions, and drawing closer to the source of the
     REGGAE  -- Tommy's office. She looks in.

     It's packed, mainly with men.  Everyone has drinks and
     talks noisily. It looks like  a fraternity smoker for
     lobbyists. MUSIC comes from  a boom box. The bar -- a
     tablecloth over some desks -- is lavishly stocked. So are
     the bookcases, which now look like liquor store shelves.
     ANGLE ON LORETTA, in a cocktail dress and a HELLO MY NAME
     IS MISS LORETTA badge, staffing a little table, handing
     Celia a name-tag.

     Celia's hands print CELIA KIRBY.    PRO BONO.
     BACK TO SCENE - ON Tommy and Reinhardt talking with a


              It's an informal breakfast. You
              give us your views, we give you
              bacon and eggs, plus a couple of
              thousand dollar honorarium.
                     
              For your favorite charity.
     Tommy looks at Reinhardt, who explains.

              The Tommy Johnson Foundation.


                     
              Honorarium. I like that.
     Loretta appears with a platter of food.

              Herring, gentlemen?

              Uh, no thanks.

              Really? We've got it in cream sauce
              and in wine sauce.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            49A.


              I think I'll pass.
     Tommy steers her aside and takes a roll of soggy,
     toothpick-impaled herring.

              What is this?    Where's the cheese?

              The cheese guy didn't return my
              call. So I called the guy at the
              American Smoked Fish Institute.
     She points at the food table. There's nothing but a
     few boxes of crackers and two huge mounds of herring --
     one white, one pink. The centerpiece is a large
     smoked fish, eyes staring accusingly.

              Oh, that's just wonderful. Sixty
              heavy hitters drop in, and I'm
              feeding 'em cat food.
     He breaks off, as Celia comes into view in the doorway
     behind. Tommy picks her up on his radar.

              We'll talk about this later.
     We follow Tommy through the crowd until he reaches Celia.

              Hi   there. Glad you could make it.
              So   you're... Celia Kirby. That's
              an   extremely beautiful name. For
              an   extremely beautiful woman.

              Wow! That's smooth. After ten
              straight hours on my feet making
              small talk and breathing cheap
              cigar smoke, that's exactly the
              kind of line I'm ready to fall for.

              Whoa, slow down.

              Sure, sure, forget it. Can you just
              tell me, which one's Congressman
              Johnson?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            49B.


              What if I said... me?

              Oh. I see. So tell me, Congressman,
              just how deep is the shit I'm
              standing in?
     Tommy has to laugh.

              Don't worry about it. Why don't
              we just start over again?

              Celia Kirby. I'm the legislative
              director of Pro Bono.

              Ah. Pro Bon. That's an extremely
              beautiful name. For an extremely
              beautiful organization. Um... what
              is it?

                     
              We're a public interest research
              and advocacy group. I'd like
              to brief you on our priorities this
              session. Can I call your AA to get
              on your schedule?

              Why don't you brief me over dinner
              tonight?


              I want an appointment, Congressman,
              not a date.

              Yeah, sure, we'll type it up on the
              schedule, it'll be an appointment,
              except with wine and flowers on the
              table.

              No thanks.   I really should be going.

              Won't you at least stay for a drink
              and some herring?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             49C.


               I'm afraid I'm busy.

               Well then, can I tempt you with a
               smelt?

               No thanks.
                      
               Nice to meet you. I'll be in touch
               with your office. I especially look
               forward to hearing your view on
               extending the sexual harassment law
               to include congressmen.


               I love the way you say that.
     She slips out through the sea of revelers.

     A fine Washington morning.


     Rep. ELIJAH MARSHALL, 50s, black, and a pain in Dodge's
     ass, is shaking hands and saying goodbye to some
     Constituents. Dodge approaches.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 3/25/92            50.


              I heard in the steam room you're
              going to try to screw up my ethics
              bill.

              Not screw up.    Amend.

              Come on, Eli, your amendments don't
              have a chance in hell to pass. My
              bill isn't perfect, I know, but
              it'll pass. And the President'll
              sign it.


              "Isn't perfect"? Dick, your bill's
              the Incumbents Protection Act! How
              can you even call it an ethics bill?

              Because the public wants an ethics
              bill! So that's what we call it.

              But it's got no teeth! It won't
              change a thing, and you know it.

              Come on, Eli, you're a politician,
              too. The less you're going to do
              about something, the more you have
              to talk about it. You know that.
     They start walking.


              I see. We close the bank, we
              stop the rubber checks, we raise
              the prices in the barber shop, we
              stop fixing parking tickets, and
              abracadabra! We say we've cleaned
              up Congress. Well, I don't think
              the American people want what
              this place has become.

              That's the beauty of it! They
              must, Eli -- they keep re-electing
              us.

              Not anymore! This new Congress is
              full of new faces.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            51.


              Oh, I wouldn't read too much into
              that. A few extra retirements, some
              redistricting -- nothing more than
              that. It's still business as usual
              up here.
     Dodge takes his glasses from his pocket and wipes them.

              I live in the real world, Eli.
              Do you? What's unemployment up
              to in your district? Eight
              percent? Eight-five?


              Eight point six.

              Power and Enterprise is about to
              fund a solar demonstration plant,
              Eli. It could mean a whole lot to
              a district -- new jobs, new
              construction -- that interest you?

              You can't bribe me, Dick.

     Dodge and Marshall enter.

              Eli, the people who elected you.
              They sent you here to help them.
              Don't you want to?


              Not  if it means supporting your bill.
              All  you want is the perfect platform
              to  campaign for Speaker. Dick Dodge.
              Mr.  Clean. What a joke!

                     
              Come on board, Eli.
                     
              You know -- you can't save the
              world if you can't save your seat.
     Tommy enters.   Marshall gives him a once-over and extends
     a hand.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            52.


              We haven't met. Eli Marshall.

              Tommy Johnson.

              I know. The Florida upset. Well,
              now that you're here, what are
              you going to do with it? You
              gonna feather your own nest, or
              are you gonna make something of
              your office?

              I plan to be as good a congressman
              as all the others.

              Exactly what does that mean?

              Well, ever since I got back from
              Nam, I've wanted to do something
              about the rain forest --

              No, do me a favor, don't tell me.
              I try not to get depressed until
              the second week of a new
              session.

                     (ushering Tommy into
                      his office)
              Eli, you'll excuse us -- we have a
              meeting.


              Johnson, I'm the chairman of a
              committee up here called Power and
              Industry. We've got an open seat,
              and I was wondering if you'd
              consider filling it.

              Is this good news?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              53.


                     
              Well, it is a difficult assignment --
              look at what we cover: energy,
              health, telecommunications,
              environment... the committee is
              constantly beset by a swarm of
              special interests. These are
              powerful people, they've got all the
              money in the world, and they're
              not shy about using it.

              So... this is very good news.


              Most members would give their right
              nut for it.

              So what do you want from me, Dick?

              Congressman... I just want you to
              smile for the cameras.

     The committee members -- all white males, except Tommy --
     mill around, awaiting the start of the hearings. As the
     TV cameras whir, Dodge shakes Tommy's hand warmly. Big
     smiles and an explosion of flashbulbs.
     Dodge breaks off and Tommy drifts over to Reinhardt.

                     
              So, Congressman, welcome to the
              honey pot. You should be one
              happy freshman.

              Yeah? Well, I'm not. I'm suspicious.
              One thing I've learned is, when
              somebody gives you something for
              nothing, the nothing ain't nothing.
              It's something. What is it? Why
              me?
     Reinhardt puts his hand on Tommy's shoulders.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               54.


              Congressman, I don't want you to
              take this the wrong way, but...
              you're black. And I mean that in
              the nicest possible way.

              Keep talking.

              Dodge wants to run for Speaker.
              And he ain't gonna make it without
              votes from the black caucus.
     Suddenly, Dodge reappears.   He throws his arm around
     Tommy's shoulders.

              Tommy, someone I want you to meet...
     Dodge steers TJ to a preppy-looking man at the witness
     table -- BARCLAY "SKEETER" WARBURTON.

              Skeeter, do you know Tommy Johnson?
              Meet the new member of the committee.
              Tommy, this is Barclay Warburton.

              Pleased to meet you, Barclay.
     WARBURTON'S voice is aristocratic, a la George Plimpton.

              Skeeter. Please. Been called
              that since boarding school.


              Skeeter.

              Damned fine to meet you.
     As Dodge and Tommy head for the dais, Tommy imitates
     Warburton's lockjaw.

              "Tommy. Please. Been called
              that since reform school."
     Dodge chuckles, shakes his head in mock rebuke. Tommy
     takes his seat at the lower dais, smiles at the Members
     on his left and right.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             55.

     ON THE UPPER DAIS, Dodge gavels...

              This EPA oversight hearing of the
              Committee on Power and Industry
              will come to order. I'd like to
              welcome our first witness, the
              distinguished Administrator of the
              Environmental Protection Agency...
                     
              ... but before I do, I note that
              a new Member is joining us today,
              the distinguished gentleman from
              Florida.

     THE BIGGEST EXPLOSION OF FLASHES YET... and as the motor
     drives whir, Tommy flashes his biggest smile yet.

     Tommy's office walls are now richly hung with plaques,
     awards, and framed photos. We see he has been named the
     PESTICIDE COALITION'S Man of the Month. The winner of
     the NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION'S Achievement Award. The
     MOTION PICTURE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA'S Outstanding Young
     Legislator. Etc. The liquor is gone.
     Loretta is at the receptionist's desk.   A LOBBYIST
     enters.

              Morning. Ron Yaeger. Snack-PAC --
              Snack Foods Political Action
              Committee. I have a ten o'clock.

              Please have a seat. The congressman
              is running just a little bit late.
     He sits and opens his briefcase. Van Dyke approaches him
     with the dignity of a superb butler.

              Would you care for some herring?

     Tommy rises to speak at a breakfast meeting. The podium
     bears the seal of the American Poultry Association.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            56.


              Let me start with a confession. I
              don't know much about poultry.
              But I do know something about
              people. And let me tell you: I
              like you people. So when you have
              something to say about poultry,
              I listen. Thank you very much.
     He sits down to generous APPLAUSE. ON Armando, in
     attendance, CLAPPING, marveling at the response TJ gets.

     Capitol Hill is actually two worlds: the aboveground
     buildings that visitors and television cameras see, and
     the catacombs, the busy tunnels and corridors connecting
     the congressional office buildings and the Capitol.
     They're surprisingly unglamorous -- exposed pipes, white-
     washed brick walls, dumpsters, pizza carry-outs -- and
     through them move the legislators and their staffs.
     And here is Tommy, whistling ZIPPEDY DOO DAH. He loves
     this place. Passing a snack bar, he greets the Cashier.

              My man.
     He blows a kiss to a pretty Teller in the credit union.
     Passing the barber shop, he calls out to the Shoeshine
     Guy. He passes a black TELEPHONE MAN at an open panel of
     wires.

              Tommy!    What's up, man?


                     
              Sweet Sue. Third race at Santa Anita.

     Several lobbyists are now awaiting Tommy balancing plates
     of herring on their knees. Some are enjoying it more
     than others. Tommy breezes in.

              Hey, how you folks doin', good to see
              you, Van Dyke making you comfortable?
     Tommy hits a button on a tape deck, turning on some EASY



     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            57.


              Be with y'all shortly.
     BEHIND THE DIVIDER, outside Tommy's office door, Tommy has
     a word with Reinhardt. Tommy indicates his office.

              She in there?
     Reinhardt nods.   Tommy gives himself a couple of squirts of
     Binaca.

              Stick around for this, Reinhardt.
              I've finally figured something out
              about the women in this town.

     Tommy and Reinhardt meeting with Celia and an elfin guy
     in corduroy.

              Thank you for seeing us, congressman,
              we won't take up much of your time.
              This is Ira Schecter, our research
              director.

              Hi, good to meet you, you folks know
              Reinhardt, don't you? Don't rush, Miss
              Kirby, we can take as long as we want.

              But you have people waiting, and --


              That's all right. They can wait.

              Well.
     She pulls documents from her briefcase and hands them to
     Tommy.

              These are issue papers. This
              session we're targeting auto
              insurance premiums, child safety,
              and food additives.   As votes come
              up, we know you'll be hearing plenty
              from the other side. We'd just like
              a clean shot at making our case, too.



     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            58.


                     
              So, we'll follow up with your staff
              in the next week or...

              Wait a minute, you just got here. I
              clean my calendar, and you're out
              the door. Let's back up, give this
              stuff the attention it deserves.
              Car insurance... Ira, what do you
              pay?

              Oh, I've got an '85 Plymouth, about
              six-fifty a year...

              Six-fifty? Highway robbery! A chop
              shop wouldn't give you more than a
              hundred forty for a junker like that.
                     
              Or so I've heard.
                     
              But I'm flying blind here, I need
              depth. Could Miss Kirby put together
              a briefing? Maybe schedule a
              Saturday or two to really dig into
              the issues?

                     
              Oh... we'd be delighted. We've got
              some figures that will amaze you.

              I'm sure you do.

                     
              Well, we won't take up any more...

              Whoa, whoa, hold on, what about
              child safety?

              Well, we're sponsoring a bill
              imposing safety standards on
              imported toys...


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               59.


              Great! About time! I     hate imported
              toys. What about food    additives?
              How about we block out   a few
              evenings, you can take   me through
              the details.

              Celia, if that's what the
              Congressman wants... any problem?

                     
              You want to do this in the evening?


              I'm away for the next two weeks.
     She gives him a look.    Ira turns to Tommy.

              So, when can Celia start your
              briefings?

              Saturday night?

              Saturday night sounds fine.

              Fine. Wednesday morning.      Nine-
              fifteen.


     On a door in the House sub-basement:    MEMBERS ONLY.

     The regular evening pickup basketball game. Even among
     these ruthless players, Tommy's street moves are outstand-
     ingly down and dirty. His principal accomplice: Elijah
     Marshall.

     A standing poker game among the towel- and robe-clad
     Members.
     It's Tommy's shuffle and deal.    He is convincingly awkward.
     A BULLDOG of a man examines his hand, tosses two cards in.
     He assembles his new hand. Four fives and an ace.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               60.

     ON Tommy's hand.   A pair of threes.
     The betting starts, at a couple of chips, and comes round
     to Tommy. He pushes a stack of chips to the center.

              Let's get serious, fellas.

     Tommy, Marshall, and the Bulldog, back in suits, exit the
     MEMBERS ONLY door and move through the catacombs.

              I need your help on the ethics
              bill, Leon. I want you to co-
              sponsor my amendments.

              You make a persuasive case, Eli.

              That wasn't a yes.

                     (courteously
                      ambiguous)
              I promise to give it the attention
              it deserves.
     The Bulldog gives Tommy a friendly squeeze --

              Better luck next time, son.
     -- and leaves them.   Tommy and Marshall continue on.


              He took six hundred dollars off
              you that last hand, didn't he?

              Yeah, he's taking a real shine to
              me.

              If I didn't know better, I'd say
              you lost to him on purpose.

              Nothing wrong with letting the
              chairman of the ethics committee
              roll you once in a while.


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           60A.


                     
              You fit in real well up here.   Too
              well.

              So Eli, how come you haven't asked
              for my help with your amendments?

              Give it a rest, Tommy. You've got
              a great jump shot. But everyone
              knows you're Dick Dodge's boy.

              Don't waste your outrage on me.
              I know what you are.

              I'm no different from anyone else.

              That's not true. Some people here
              actually try to do something
              besides save their own ass.

              You know, Eli, I like you, I really
              do. You remind me of my father.

              Oh, really?   How so?

              He thought I was scum, too.
     BELLS begin RINGING and LIGHTS FLASHING on all the clocks
     and sconces down the corridor. Three RINGS, pause,
     three RINGS, pause... Marshall does a U-turn. Tommy
     doesn't follow suit.

              Aren't you going to vote?

                     
              Vote? Is that what that is? We
              got a pool going in the office on
              when it'll go off next.

      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            60B.

      It's called "Gucci Gulch." The lobby just outside the
      doors to the House chamber is pandemonium -- a sea of
      lobbyists, lawyers, PACmen, Members, and staffers
      urgently trying to find their masters and signal them
      thumbs-up or-down. Tommy enters, sweeps the room with
      his eyes, looking for Reinhardt, shrugs, then goes
      through the doors onto the floor.

      Tommy goes to a console on the rear of a seat.
      A blue light says OPEN. Tommy inserts a card (it looks
      like an electronic hotel key). Red, green, and amber
      lights at buttons labeled NAY, YEA, and PRES. Tommy
      shrugs, pushes NAY.

      As Tommy heads away, he passes a class trip -- a dozen
      fifth-graders and their TEACHER, who hails him.

                Excuse me -- Congressman? Do you
                have a moment? We're from the
                Hawthorne Avenue School, in Union,
                New Jersey? I'm Mrs. Kozlowski.
                Social Studies. We were just
                learning how a bill becomes a law.
                       (indicating the

                Was that a vote?

                Yes, it was.


                And what did you vote?

                I voted "Nay." It's a terrible
                bill. It'd destroy the fabric of
                American life.

                And what was the vote on?
      Tommy hasn't a clue. He calls out to Rafe, who is among
      those leaving the chamber.

                Hey, Rafe! Tell these kids what
                that vote was about.

                Guy's got a real knack for
                explaining things.

                Well, it was a motion to reconsider
                the motion to reconsider.
      Bo, passing by, intervenes.

                No, it was the rule on amending the

      A NOISY restaurant popular with lobbyists. Power photos
      on the wall. Table hopping. People SHOUTING greetings
      across the room. Waiters in long aprons. Tommy is
      having lunch with Tommy O'Connor.

                You're a gentleman, Tommy. We can
                always do bid'ness -- I like that
                in a Member.

                Thank you, Tommy. I love you too.

                Listen, I'd like to do more money
                for you -- I just need to know
                your positions on a few issues.
      O'Connor takes out a pen and leather notecard case.

                For instance, where are you on
                sugar price supports?


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            62.

     Tommy has no idea, but he's certainly open to
     suggestions.

              Sugar price supports. Where do
              you think I should be, Tommy?

              Shit -- makes no difference to me.
              If you're for 'em, I got money for
              you from my sugar producers in
              Louisiana and Hawaii. If you're
              against 'em, I got money for you
              from the candy manufacturers.


              You pick.

                     
              Let's put you down as for. Now
              what about putting limits on
              malpractice awards?

              You tell me.

              Well, if you're for 'em, I got
              money from the doctors and
              insurance companies. If you're
              against 'em, I got money from the
              trial lawyers. Tell you what,
              let's say against. Now how about
              pizza?


                     
              I'll stick with the salad.

              Not for lunch, shmuck, for PAC
              money. A lot of the frozen
              pizzas use phony cheese. There's
              a law pending requiring them to
              disclose it on their labels.
              Where do you stand?
     Tommy thinks it through.

              If I vote for the labels...then I
              get money from the dairy industry...


     THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92          63.


              Good...

              And if I vote against the labels,
              I get money from the frozen food
              guys.

              Excellent! And don't forget the
              ranchers, because they get hurt
              if pepperoni sales go down!

              town.

              So which is it?

              Fuck the cheese people. Thanks to
              them my office smelled like smelt
              for a week.

              All right.    For.

              So Tommy, tell me -- with all this
              money on every side, how does
              anything get done?

              It doesn't!    That's the genius of
              the system!

     A briefing in progress. Flip charts, ring binders, Celia,
     Ira, a couple of other Pro Bono types. Tommy is riveted
     by Celia.

              It comes down to a question of
              what is acceptable risk. Are we
              willing to feed our kids a
              substance that causes cancer in
              lab rats? More important, who
              gets to make the decision?
              Bureaucrats and big corporations,
              or the people whose lives depend
              on it?

     Tommy's staff shares one small office.   Everyone's on the
     phone.

              Mr. Willie? Congressman Johnson is
              calling. Can you take his call?
              Thank you. Please hold.
     Van Dyke puts him on hold, counts to three, gets back on
     the line.

              I'm sorry, Mr. Willie, he just
              picked up another call. Listen, I
              know why he was calling -- he
              hasn't heard from you about his
              fundraiser...
     PAN TO Armando.

              ... That's right, Mr. Brown, on
              the thirtieth... A thousand a
              couple...A whole table? He'll be
              so happy to hear it. Thank you so
              much.

              yes, a celebrity player. As long
              as he's on the coast, we were

              ... Uh-huh... Lovely. Now what kind
              of contribution to his foundation
              you folks thinking about?

     Celia continues her briefing.

              ...And in the 1988 study, it was
              up to eight per hundred-thousand.
              Um...am I losing you on these
              mortality rates?

              No, I was just wondering how much
              of this is a statutory problem,
              and how much is a regulatory one?
              I mean, didn't the Merton Act
              cover most of this?


                     
              Hmmm, that's an excellent point.
              Let me see something...
     As she starts rummaging in her briefcase, we TRACK AROUND
     to a COMPUTER SCREEN on Tommy's desk -- it displays THE


              Wow...you're right. Maybe we can
              get them to amend Merton-Simmons.
     RACK FOCUS...reveals REINHARDT in b.g., sitting at
     another computer terminal. He is typing in Tommy's
     responses, which appear on Tommy's screen.

              Well, for Merton to apply you have
              to show high contagion...sounds to
              me like your contagion rates are
              no higher than the common clod.
     In b.g., Reinhardt DIVES FORWARD to his keyboard and
     begins correcting his typo. Celia looks puzzled.

              Common cold.
                     
              Must have picked up a little
              dyslexia over the weekend.

              I see. Well, I must say I'm pretty
              impressed.

              You're also impressively pretty.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           66.

      Celia is startled. Tommy is embarrassed...the dumb
      compliment he's just spoken was one Reinhardt typed on
      the computer screen.

               Oh come on...

               You're right. Sorry.      Excuse me a

      frame.


               Ow!

      A jet flies through the sky.

      Tommy and handful of other Members listen to their GUN
      LOBBYIST host.

               Frankly, we    think the semi-automatic
               has gotten a    bad rap. That's why

      Everyone in the group raises their weapons: AK-47s. A
      burst of GUNFIRE. Rambo time.
      We SEE the flock still flying.

       Tommy tees off. He is wearing a veritable pro     shop of
       custom golf gear, all emblazoned with logos of    corporate
       sponsors and lobbies. He hits the ball about     200
       yards...but more or less perpendicular to the    hole.

                I knew all these congressmen get

                Where did you go?


                Oh, a fact-finding mission, some
                issue conferences, a few speaking
                engagements, a charity event... the
                usual.

                More like the Petroleum Institute

               You remembered! That means you
               missed me.

      Tommy and Celia walk over the bridge to the cherry trees
      by the Tidal Basin.


               So, how'd you end up hustling for
               Pro Bono instead of pesticides? I
               mean, you could have been a big-
               time lawyer, right?

               Oh, I was for a while.   It...
               depressed me.

               At a hundred grand a year, how
               depressed can you get? Doesn't
               it depress you to lose all the
               time?

               Sometimes. Mostly it gets me
               angry. And the anger keeps me
               going. Sure, I wouldn't mind
               winning a few. And it's not like
               I'm allergic to money...

               So why do you do it?
      She skips a stone on the water.

               God, it's so embarrassing to come
               out and say it.

               Say it.

               Meaning. I need my life to mean
               something.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               69.

      This actually hits Tommy.    Celia, embarrassed, changes
      the subject.

               My question is, how'd you get
               named after a Memorial?

               Grandma like Jefferson. Y'know,
               "Life, liberty and the pursuit of
               happiness." It's a lot to live
               up to, so I specialized in the
               last part.

               And how's the pursuit going?

               Fine...'til I met you. Now...the
               better I do, the worse I feel.
      They have stopped walking.    They are standing close
      together. They kiss.

               So...when can I see you again?
               How about dinner Saturday night?
      She shakes her head.

               How about Sunday morning?

               the Lord grants no 90-day extension!

               And when the last trump sounds,
               believe me, you will be audited!

                      
               This is one hell of a date.


      On the steps, Marshall shakes hands with his Congregants.
      Tommy and Celia exit the church. Marshall takes Celia by
      the hands and kisses her familiarly. Tommy is taken
      aback.

               Hello, darling. Glad you could
               make it.

               I liked the sermon, Uncle Eli.

               Uncle Eli?

               My niece says you're not half as
               slimy as I thought.

               Your niece?


               That would put you somewhere
               between a lizard and a toad.
               Quite a step up.
      Tommy looks from Marshall to Celia and back again.

               How could I have missed the
               family resemblance?


      WHISTLING happily, Tommy rounds the corner and heads to
      his office.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           71.

      Ahead of him, encamped in the hallway, he sees a phalanx
      of SENIOR CITIZENS, many carrying placards, and some
      camera crews. Tommy adjusts his tie, turns on the charm,
      and approaches.

               Ladies! Looking good!   How can I
               help you folks today!
      But Hattie Rifkin and her troops will have none of it.

               Don't "Ladies!" me, you dick!
      The camera lights go on.



               Now let me get this straight. You
               voted to make people on Medicare
               pay more money to their doctors?

               The Medical Association made a
               persuasive case. Ten grand from
               their PAC, plus Christmas in Aspen.

                      
               Tommy -- if I'm not mistaken, you
               wouldn't be here without the good
               senior citizens of your district.
               You got to dance with the girl
               that brung you, son. If you have
               a bit of business to do, do it
               quietly... in the corridors... in
               the subcommittees... with little
               amendments. You mess around on
               the big ones like Medicare, you'll
               be dead meat on election day.

               Yeah, well, then it's thanks for
               the memories, and on to the next
               gig.

               Do you know what your problem is,
               son? You don't think big enough.
               You have a real knack for this
               town, but you have the soul of a
               two-bit hustler. Listen to me,
               Tommy.



      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            72.


               Five hundred thirty-five Members
               of Congress. Some are smart, and
               some stupid. Some good, some not.
               But all of them, son, all of them
               consumed by the single overriding
               imperative that defines the very
               Washington way of life.

               Which is?

               Getting re-elected.


               Wait a minute. You're talkin'
               'bout my re-election?

               You don't know what percent of the
               incumbents who ran last time got
               re-elected, do you?

               Fifty?   Sixty?

               Ninety-six. And ninety-eight
               before that. It's like that
               election after election. If you
               don't fuck up, you can be here,
               raking it in, for life. Life,
               Johnson.
      Tommy considers this.   Then a big smile.


               I can think of worse places to
               get life.

                      
               I knew you had it in you.

               So how do I get the Silver Foxes
               off my ass?

               Oh, throw them a bone... why
               don't you co-sponsor a bill for
               mandatory universal health
               insurance?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            73.


               What's that mean?

               Nothing.   It'll never pass.

      A couple of Lobbyists await Tommy. Van Dyke mans the
      desk. In come ELLEN JUBA, 40s, and her 13-year-old
      daughter, MICKEY, whose pony tail sticks out from her
      Florida Marlins baseball cap.

               May I help you?


               Yes, I'm Ellen Juba. This is my
               daughter, Mickey. We'd like to
               see our congressman. We live in
               the district.

               Just a moment, please.
                      
               Could you come out? Thank you.
                      
               Be right with you.
                      
               I like your hat.
      Loretta comes out and extends a hand.

               How do you do, I'm Miss Loretta,
               public liaison for the congressman.


               Ellen Juba. My daughter Mickey.
               We'd like to see him.

               Y'all from the district? Up    here
               seein' the sights? How'd you    folks
               like some gallery passes? Go    on
               over and listen to the great   debates
               of our day?
      She reaches into Van Dyke's desk drawer to get some passes.

               We don't want to go to the gallery.
               We want to see Congressman Johnson.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            74.


               How 'bout a House key ring for each
               of you? Here -- see that? Isn't
               that something? Turns into a pen.

               You don't understand. We're not
               tourists. We're constitutents.

                      
               You aren't with some organization,
               are you, honey?

               I'm a goddam citizen! Isn't that
               enough!

               We're not leaving here till we
               see him!
      Loretta exchanges a look with the Lobbyists, who get the
      picture. She picks up the phone and speaks nonchalantly.

               Oh, Armando? Could you come out
               front, please?
      Tommy enters, carrying an enormous tennis trophy.

               Look what I won! Must be that
               new racket.
      Armando has come out to hear this.


               There a problem, congressman?

               Congressman?   You?
      Armando tries to escort her out.

               Get your hands off me!
      Mickey tries to block Armando.

               Let go of her, you creep!


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92                 75.


               Careful, she may be armed!

               Stop it!     Get away from her!
      Armando, defending himself from Mickey, manages to knock
      her hat off. With the hat comes her 
      pony tail.
      ON MICKEY.   She's bald.    Her skull bears the mark of surgery.
      Everyone stops.    It's quiet.
      Mickey's eyes burn into Tommy's.        Then she picks up her
      hat.

               Come on, Ma.      It's okay.    Let's go.

               Wait.     What happened to you?

Not just me.

      Tommy and his staff listen to the Jubas.

               I was lucky. They said they got it
               all. I'm going to be okay. But
               what about the others?

               The others?

               They call it a "cancer cluster."
               Oh, at first, none of us in the
               neighborhood wanted to believe it,
               but then we all saw it -- for me,
               it was when the two-year-old across
               the street developed a brain tumor,
               same as Mickey. We looked at
               everything -- the water, the air,
               dump sites, insects, you name it.
               But we didn't have to look that far.
               It was staring us in the face.

               What?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            76.


               Power lines.

               High-voltage power lines. The
               wires cause magnetic fields -- and
               the magnetic fields cause cancer.
               Especially in children.

               I never heard of that.
      Mickey pulls a stack of journals and xeroxes from her
      book bag and gives it to her mother, who in turn gives
      the materials to Tommy.


               The studies, the numbers -- it's
               all there.

                      
               You're not actually going to read
               those, are you?

                      
               Oh, they'll be read...

               Why don't you come see for
               yourself?
      Tommy has no quick answer.


      Children playing on swings and seesaws in a small public
      park. TILT UP. A pair of electric power derricks
      carrying 225,000-volt lines almost directly overhead.
      The derricks cast shadows across a nearby school.
      We SEE the neighborhood. Quite a few FOR SALE signs.
      A house with a moving sale in progress on the front lawn.
      ON Tommy taking it all in.   With him are Celia and the
      Jubas.

               Five children   in the neighborhood
               have cancer.    One more has
               precancerous   lesions. Pregnant
               women around   here are scared to
               death.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            77.


               This is Mickey's school?

               Turns out a lot of schools are near
               power lines. The land's cheap, so
               the schools tend to buy it from the
               power companies in the first place.

               But isn't the school district
               responsible?

               We asked the superintendent to
               measure the magnetic field inside
               the school. He said, Okay, only
               it'll cost forty thousand dollars,
               and what program did we want him to
               cut that from?

               Nice.

               We're nobody, congressman. You're
               somebody. We need your help.
      Tommy takes Celia aside.

               Do you believe it?

               It's impossible to know. No one's
               really looked into it hard enough.


               But why isn't it being investigated?

               Why didn't they investigate breast
               implants all those years? What
               about those side-effects of that
               sleeping pill, Halcion? Why isn't
               anything being investigated? It's
               always the same.

               Money talks.

               You got it.


       THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             78.


                 There must be something I can do
                 for those people.

                 Don't tell me you're actually
                 developing a conscience.

                 Shit, I hope not -- it'd be a
                 fucking nuisance in Congress.

                 No, that's not fair. Some people
                 on the Hill actually believe in
                 things, and try to do a decent job,
                 and don't forget why they went to
                 Washington, and who sent them.

                        
                 No shit.
                        
                 Oh, yeah, I met one of those
                 geeks. So what can I do?

                 Make a stink. Round up some
                 Members and hold a press
                 conference. Get that committee of
                 yours to hold hearings. Haul in
                 in the Environmental Protection
                 Agency, the Surgeon General, the
                 National Academy of Sciences. Get
                 the issue on every breakfast table
                 in America.



       A press conference. Half a dozen congressmen, Tommy
       among them. Iowa is speaking to the few Cameras and
       Reporters. Beside him, Mickey Juba and her mother.
       Reinhardt and Ceila among the handful of staff and
       onlookers.

                 This goes beyond personal tragedy.
                 It goes to a public health hazard
                 of unknown proportions. It goes
                 to the right of ordinary people to
                 know all the facts --


       THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              79.


                 Yeah, right -- people ought to
                 know if their neighborhoods are
                 killing them.

                 Amen, gentleman. Amen.
       They turn, somewhat surprised to see Dick Dodge, who
       joins Iowa at the microphones, a natural leader.

                 What a fine effort this is. I am
                 totally sympathetic. Congressional
                 hearings should be scheduled as
                 soon as possible. The American
                 people deserve no less.
       He puts an arm around Mickey.

                 Message:   we care.

       Tommy and Celia are watching the press conference on TV.

                 Well, congratulations. You've
                 found yourself your own hopeless
                 cause.

                 Speaking of hopeless causes...
       They kiss, and slide OUT OF FRAME.





       An impressive THUNDERSTORM pounds on Dodge's windows.

                        
                 On the rocks, or neat?

                 Whatever you're having.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            80.


               Well, why ruin good bourbon with
               the taste of some shitty Sears
               icemaker, that's what I always say.
                      
               Cheers.

               Cheers.
      Dodge downs his drink.   Tommy follows suit.

               Son, you're a real comer. I
               wouldn't be surprised if you ended
               up in the leadership. I'll say
               this: if I were Speaker, I'd
               sleep better with you as a
               lieutenant.

               Why, thank you, Mr. Chairman. You
               know, to tell you the truth, I
               didn't know you'd be on my side on
               those power lines.

               But I'm not.

               But you said you were sympathetic --

               Of course I did. We're all
               sympathetic to little girls with
               cancer. But I'm not sympathetic
               to holding an inquiry.

               But you said --

               I know what I said. But that was
               just a press conference, son. I
               wasn't under oath.
      The intercom BUZZES.

                      
               Yes?... Bring them right in!
                      
               Look. Son. It's great to get
               your name in the paper.



      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             81.


               I bet the gentleman from Iowa was
               all over the evening news in Des
               Moines tonight. Getting good
               press -- letting them know you
               care -- that's what it's all about.
               Smart move, Tommy. But that's as
               far as I'd go with this, if I were
               you.
      The door opens. Dodge turns to see Olaf Anderson, Tommy
      O'Connor, and Zeke Bridges enter.

               What a surprise!


               Mr. Chairman!

               Mr. Chairman! Hello, Tommy. Zeke
               you're looking well, good to see you.

                      
               Good to see you, you old sum' bitch.

               Evening, Mr. Chairman, thanks for
               taking the -- Tommy, you s.o.b., they
               let you in here?
                      (indicating Andersen and
                       Bridges)
               You folks finally get to press flesh!
               Olaf, meet Tommy Johnson. Tommy, Olaf
               Andersen. Chairman of Gulf Coast
               Power.

               The boys here have told me a lot
               about you.

               Yeah -- I told him you voted for him!
      They all share a laugh.    Except for Bridges, who squints
      at Tommy.

               Glad to meet you, son. They tell me
               you've got a real talent for the
               game.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            81A.


               And this is Zeke Bridges, CEO of
               Pyramid Insurance.

                      
               Congressman.

               Good to meet you.

               Help me with these, would you,
               Tommy?

      He hands Tommy a couple of drinks.

                      
               Chivas on the rocks?

                      
               You look awfully familiar.
      Tommy just smiles.

               Tommy and I were just talking about
               power lines.

               Yeah, what a coincidence. I
               thought this little party might be
               for me.
                      
               You may not like this.
                      
               I think we should hold those
               hearings.

               You really fell for the line that
               parents group fed you, didn't you?
      Tommy is struck by Dodge's intelligence.

               How'd you know I met the parents
               group?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            81B.


               Oh, I keep my ear to the ground,
               that's what a good politician does.
               Listen, Tommy, why don't we just get
               Olaf's take on this.

               It's tragic, cancer's a terrible
               thing, but there's no way you can
               link it to power lines. Truth is,
               there's a bigger electromagnetic
               field given off by an electric
               blanket, or a microwave oven, than
               by those derricks.


               But there are studies that say --

               For every study that says one thing,
               I'll show you a study saying another.
               We've studied it ourselves. Nada.

               There's not a single state health
               official anywhere in this country
               who says power lines cause cancer.

               But what if you're wrong?
      As Tommy persists, Andersen looks increasingly angry.

               People didn't use to say smoking
               causes cancer, either. What if the
               evidence is just building, and some
               day we wake up and discover that
               your power lines are killing us?

                       
               "Kill  us"? "Kill us"? You calling
               me a  murderer? You're saying there's
               blood  on these hands? How dare you
               talk  to me like that, you --
      O'Connor puts a restraining arm on Andersen.

               Calm down, Olaf, calm down, he
               didn't mean it that way, did you,
               son? Alright, gentlemen. Easy.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             82.

      Andersen backs off, regains his composure.    The outburst
      makes an impression on Tommy.
                             Tommy
               I'm just saying, it's worth looking
               into.

               Tommy -- do you want to move the power
               lines? Do you know how much it
               would cost to bury them? Millions.
               Tens of millions. I don't have that
               money. The state doesn't have that
               money. You people up here sure
               don't have that money. You know
               who'd end up paying for it? Folks
               who sent you here, that's who.

               Now how'd you like the   people in
               your district to think   of you as the
               putz who tripled their   electric bill?
               You think they'd thank   you for that
               on election day?

               All I'm saying is, maybe we should
               hold hearings to look at --

               Think for a minute, boychik. You
               hold your hearings. Overnight,
               everyone who lives near a substation
               finds the value of his home in the
               toilet. You kill the real estate
               market.


               You kill the insurance companies.

               You kill the school district.

               You kill the local economy.

               For a smart boy, you're not
               thinking very politically.
      Tommy watches the LIGHTNING.

               Maybe I should think about it.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             83.


                Yeah, the system ain't perfect,
                but the fleas come with the dawg.

                Oh, by the    way, Tommy, on a completely
                different    subject -- You don't have a
                state PAC    yet, do you? I'd like to
                give you a    hundred thousand dollar
                corporate    contribution to start one
                up.

                My company would be honored to do
                the same.


                Can you do that?     I thought there
                were limits --

                Oh, it's all aboveboard, we all
                believe deeply in the rules. It's
                just that the state rules are often
                more flexible about these things.

                Are you interested?

                I'm always interested in the
                happiness of my constituents.

                I'll drink to that.

      Dodge and Andersen shoot each other a look.




      Tommy pulls up in a Corvette with Florida congressional
      plates in front of his Capitol Hill row house.

      Tommy slips into bed next to Celia, who's half asleep.

                Mmmm...


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            84.


               Mmmm...

               So what did he say?

               Who?

               Dodge.    The hearings.

               Oh -- I, uh, haven't asked him yet.

      Celia suddenly looks quite awake.

                      
               It wasn't the right moment.
               Besides, I was thinking, maybe I
               ought to line up some other Members
               first -- you know, get my ducks in
               a row.

               Oh.

      Dick Dodge and several other towel-clad MEMBERS.

               You see that ABC poll?

               Free fall.

               President in trouble like that, he's
               liable to do something desperate.
               Some damn fool stunt.

               Invade Japan.

               Declare war on Congress, more like
               it.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 3/25/92             85A.

      The door opens.     Eli Marshall, fully dressed, comes in.

               You shafted me on the ethics bill.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            86.


               Hello, Eli, good to see you.   Why
               don't you loosen your tie?

               It's a closed rule. I can't get my
               amendments on the floor. I can't get
               a recorded vote. I can't get squat.

               Last time I looked, it was the Rules
               Committee in charge of that. This
               isn't the Rules Committee, Eli.
               This is the steam room.


               This is the U.S. Congress! The
               American people deserve better than --

               You know what your problem is, Eli?
               You've got sermonitis.
      The other Members chuckle.

               Can't open your mouth without
               climbing into the pulpit, can you?
               Why don't you just calm down, have
               a massage --

               I've got news for you, Dick. I'm
               going to run against you for Speaker.
               I may not have a rat's ass of a
               chance to beat you. But I sure as
               hell can tell the world the kind of
               sleaze you stand for.


               I went too far with him, I know it.
               You know him pretty well, don't you?

               Oh, I don't know...

               Come on, you play basketball
               together, you're seeing his niece,
               you've been to his church --

               How did you know that?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             87.

      Dodge indicates his bloodhound nose.

               He'll listen to you, Tommy. I want
               you to go make peace between us.
               Tell him we'll work something out
               on his amendments -- not a vote, I
               won't go that far, but at least
               he'll get to say his piece on the
               floor. Just get him off my back.
               Can you do that for me?

               That's not a question, is it?


               That's right.     Is there a problem?

               No, no -- I've still got my right
               nut, I can work with that.

      A WAITER removes an empty pitcher of beer.

               Another?

               Sure, why not.
      Marshall takes a boiled crab from the platter between them,
      places it on the butcher paper in front of him, christens
      it --


               The honorable Dick Dodge.
      -- raises a big wooden mallet, and SMASHES it on the crab,
      smiling.

               You know, Eli, sometimes people do
               things they regret. Everyone makes
               mistakes. Fact is, Dick's been
               under a lot of pressure lately --

               That man's a walking quid quo pro
               -- prid quo -- quid pro quo, and
               you know it. He put you up to
               this, didn't he?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             88.


               What do you mean?

               Don't shit me, Tommy. You're Dick
               Dodge's yes-man. I know what
               you're up to. This is damage
               control.

               I'm not a yes-man. When Dick says
               no, I say no.
      Marshall SMASHES down again with the mallet.    Crab carnage.


               You know why no one on the Hill
               drops a dime on anyone else? Mutual
               assured destruction. Our little
               gentleman's agreement. Everybody
               has something on somebody, so nobody
               has anything on anybody, because
               everybody wants to save his own ass.

                      
               Oh, yeah? What do they have on you?

               They think I'm a pompous ass.

               Shit, that ain't no secret.


      Reinhardt and Loretta about to go in.

               You sure they don't want to be
               alone, Reinhardt?

               No, no -- I bet they've been talking
               about the ethics bill all night.
               Come on, Loretta, you'll know how to
               get Marshall's mind off business.


               Shit, this place isn't about passing
               laws any more. It isn't about doing
               good any more. All it's about is...
               being here.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             88A.

      Loretta and Reinhardt approach their table.

               Well, as I live and breathe.   Tommy!
      Tommy is surprised to see them.   She flashes a smile at
      Marshall.

               Eli, this is Loretta Hicks, from my
               staff. Loretta, Congressman Marshall.

               Pleasure to meet you.


               Entirely mine.

               You know Reinhardt, my AA?
      Marshall nods.   Reinhardt turns to Tommy.

               Excuse me, congressman, could I just
               do a couple of quick calendar things
               with you?

                      
               Would you care for a drink?

               Tell you the truth, nothing for me.

               Well, when a pretty lady shoots him
               down, an old man knows it's time to
               go home.
      Marshall rises, pulling out his car keys.

               You kids have a good time.

                      
               Listen, you gentlemen look like
               you've had a few -- Loretta, why
               don't you be a designated driver?
      Loretta stands and takes Marshall's keys from him.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             89.


               Excellent idea.

               Ah.    The good Samaritan.

               Good night, y'all.
      They leave.

               Now we've already got the Bankruptcy
               Institute breakfast tomorrow, but if
               you don't mind we could wedge in the
               Prune Board --
      This isn't what Tommy wants to be doing now.    He gets up.

               I'm packing it in.

                      
               Can we talk while I drive you?

               Thanks, I'll walk. I could use
               the air.

      Marshall and Loretta are singing.
                             MARSHALL and LORETTA
               "Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,
               that saved a wretch like me -- "

      Tommy is on foot. Marshall's car, with its Maryland
      congressional plates, pulls over.

               Come on, honey, no use you getting
               mugged.

                             MARSHALL and LORETTA
               "I once was lost, but now am found;
               was blind, but now I see... "
      Tommy, in the back, cradles his head.   As Loretta heads
      into a traffic circle, she SEES

      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             90.

      in high sling-back heels.


                      
               Check out the fuck-me pumps on that.
               Mm-mm. I gotta get me some shoes
               like that.

               Loretta!   Please! Your mouth!


      With a SCREECH of brakes and a CRUNCH of metal, a TAXI
      rear-ends them, SLAMMING Marshall's car into a lamppost.

      The Taxi Driver looks at the wreck for a moment.   Then
      he lays rubber and SQUEALS away.

      On the back floor, Tommy stirs. Seems to be okay.
      Lifts himself to see up front. The windshield is
      smashed. Loretta and Marshall are both unconscious.
      Tommy climbs into the front but can't get the door open.
      He kicks out a broken window and climbs through.
      He runs to a phone on the corner and dials 911.

               I need an ambulance right away.

      IN THE CAR no motion from Loretta or Marshall.
      AT THE PHONE he dials another number.

               Evening, Mrs. Dodge, Tommy Johnson
               here, sorry to call at this hour,
               is Dick back from the Gridiron
               dinner yet? Could I speak with him
               for just a moment?

      MRS. DODGE is in bed. She hands the phone to Dodge,
      who's in white tie and tails, looking more sinister
      than splendid.

               Tommy Johnson.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           91.


                      
               What's wrong?
      INTERCUT Tommy and Dodge.

               How did you know?

               Good news doesn't come at this hour.

               I went out with Marshall. We got into
               an accident. He's out cold. I'm okay.

      Dodge looks off balance.

               Were you driving?

               No.   Someone else. Loretta.
      Dodge recovers his equilibrium.

               The girl from your office?

               Yeah. She's out, too. I don't
               like the way it looks. For anybody.
               Look. You said you wanted to get
               back into Marshall's good graces.
               Well, here's an opportunity.


               Listen carefully. Tell the
               ambulance to take you to Walter
               Reed. It's a privilege they give
               congressmen. It's also the only
               hospital without a bunch of goddam
               reporters shtupping the nurses in
               exchange for leaks. They'll keep
               it quiet. I'll handle the police.
               You go home and keep your mouth shut.

      Two figures approach one another in the shadows:
      Reinhardt, and the Taxi Driver who rear-ended Marshall's
      car. The cabbie nods.   Reinhardt hands him an envelope.
      The Driver inspects the cash.

      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             91A.

      Tommy is shaving.   He HEARS the local tv news from the
      bedroom.

               ... and the Beltway is bumper-to
               bumper, so you might as well take a
               day of annual leave and enjoy
               yourself. At the top of the news,
               Maryland Congressman Elijah Marshall
               is in satisfactory condition at
               Walter Reed Hospital after an
               overnight accident in the District.
      Tommy bolts into the bedroom.    On the television he sees


      A CORRESPONDENT doing a stand-up.

               That's right, Tom. Marshall
               reportedly had alcohol in his blood.
               Also slightly injured was an
               unidentified woman whom police say
               has a record in several states for
               prostitution.
      Tommy looks sick.

               Oh sweet Jesus.

               Linda, Congressman Marshall --
               that's Reverend Marshall, isn't it?


               Right you are, Tom. How this plays
               into his longstanding campaign to
               reform congressinoal ethics is now
               anyone's guess.

               Thank you.   In other news...
      Tommy leaps for his clothes.

      Tommy races down the corridor.   Ahead of him, Celia,
      coming out of Marshall's room.   She freezes at the sight
      of him.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              92.


               Get away from him.
      He approaches her.

               And get away from me.

               I have to talk to you.

               Go away!

               I was set up!

               You were set up? You were in the
               car! I didn't hear your name on the
               news!

               No, someone screwed him --

               "Someone"?

               Celia, something stinks here --

               Yeah -- it's you! You don't give a
               damn about anything! And to think,
               the other night, I actually thought
               you cared about someone else.

      He puts his hand to her face.    She brushes it off.

               Not me, you jerk -- Mickey Juba!
               You caved on those power lines,
               didn't you? I knew it. Damn it, I
               knew it! What did you get for it?
               Tommy O'Connor's box at the
               Redskins? Someone slip you a condo
               in the Virgin Islands?

               If you'd give me a chance to --


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               93.


               God, I hate this town -- the only
               reason I stay is because I hate it
               so much.

               Celia --

               Get the hell out of here.


      sitting on the ground, backs to us, beneath the power
      lines. A quiet moment.
      REVERSE ANGLE - TWO SHOT.   Mickey is shuffling a deck of
      cards.

               Is it thumb over, or thumb under?

               Under.
      She tries her hand at a false shuffle.

               Not bad, kid.    You've got potential.

               So what's happening? I thought you
               were going to kick some ass on --
      She indicates the derricks.      Tommy looks at her, comes to
      a decision.

               I am.
      He takes the deck from her, fans it face up, pulls all the
      kings and aces, stacks them on top, and squares the deck.

               This is one's called the double
               duke. How many players?

               Six.

               Who's the mark?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            94.

      She points to an imaginary poker player.

               Number two -- over there.
      Tommy, smiling, calculates something for a moment, then
      gives the deck four shuffles. He hands Mickey the cards.

               Your deal.
      She deals out six hands in a circle on the ground.

               Look at the sucker's hand.

      She turns over the hand at number two.   It has the four
      kings. Mickey WHISTLES at the hand.

               Look at your hand.
      She turns over her own hand. It has the four aces.
      Mickey looks at the power lines, at the hands, at TJ.
      Then, understanding:

               That's what you're going to do?
      Tommy nods.   Her face opens into a big smile.

               Let's kick some ass.    What do I do?

               Something very important.


      Tommy pow-wows with Loretta Van Dyke, and Armando.   Aside
      from a sling, Loretta looks okay.

               Why are we meeting here, Tommy?
               There trouble at the office?

                      
               "I keep my ear close to the ground."
               His ear my ass. He had an inside
               man.

               That little fuck Reinhardt?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             95.


               Hot damn -- I knew my driving wasn't
               that bad. Speaking of which -- you think
               I should wear one of those whiplash
               things, Tommy? There some insurance
               angle I should be working here?

               We got bigger fish to fry, darlin'.

               What do we do?

                      
               The big con.

               We gonna git that sucker.

               Dick always said I should think big.

               Whoa! Aren't we gettin' out of our
               league, man? That Dodge is a pro!

               You can't con a con, Congressman.

               Shit, that's right, Tommy -- these
               politicians are serious slick fish.

               You people gone soft on me? Bunch
               of fuckin' incumbents I got here.
               Now listen up. Thursday morning
               Dodge has a breakfast with the Arts
               Caucus in the Longworth Room. Armando
               -- find out how fast I can get from
               Longworth to my office. Loretta --
               we need some scoop from the EPA for
               the roper, I'll give you a list.
               Van Dyke -- call Hattie at the Silver
               Foxes, and --

               Wait a minute -- we need a new roper,
               don't we? Everyone around here
               knows our faces.
      Outside a HORN sounds .    Tommy looks at his watch.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            96.


               Right on the nose.
      He throws open the bay window of the narrow house. Just
      below is a pickup truck with "Homer's Pit Stop" lettered
      on the side. Homer gets out.

               My man!
      The others come to the window to see Homer, still wearing
      his fuel-smeared overalls, and SHOUT greetings.

               Now let's get to work.


      The Members are being seated for a hearing. At the dais,
      Tommy approaches Dodge. A beat as Dodge studies Tommy's
      face.

               Eli Marshall caught his tail in a
               crack, didn't he?

               He did.

               You kept my name out of it.

               I did.

               I owe you one.

                      
               You learn fast.

               Do me one favor, Dick. Next time
               you pull some heavy shit involving
               my ass, tip me off, okay?

                      
               Alright, son.
                      
               This hearing of the Power and
               Enterprise Committee is now in
               order. The health of America's
               securities industry --


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              97.

      Reinhardt approaches Tommy and slips him a packet of
      materials.

                      
               Thanks. Listen, Reinhardt, something's
               come up, and I don't quite know how
               to handle it. There's a guy from
               the EPA -- I don't know him -- says
               he wants to see me. Tonight. Out
               of the office. Alone, he says.
               Sound of it makes me nervous. I'd
               feel better if you were there.

               You got it, jefe.

      A man waits, alone, in the shadow of a large statue.
      It's Homer. In a jacket and tie, his stubble shaved off,
      he looks like a plausible government worker. Tommy and
      Reinhardt approach.

               Mr. Yancey?

                      
               I thought you'd be alone.

               He's my AA. He goes where I go. If
               you can trust me, you can trust him.
      Homer eyes Reinhardt a moment, then continues.


               Congressman, I have information I
               think you may want. It's about
               something going on at the EPA.

               What have you got?

               I got a wife and three kids, and a
               note on my house, that's what I got.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            98.


                      
               Nothin' comes for nothin' in this
               town, do it?
                      
               You got any cash on you? I'm kind
               of light.

                      
               You can't do that!

                      
               This stuff's pretty good?


               In the right hands, it could mean a
               great deal.

               Okay. Sunday. Fifth race at Del
               Mar. Blueboy is running twenty to
               one. I'd take a major position.

               You have to be shitting me.

               No, not at all -- my Cousin Henry
               spends his days pumping water into
               horses' stomachs and stuffing
               Percodan up their butts. Trust me.
      Reinhardt is interested in this.   And he admires Tommy's
      m.o.


                      
               Alright. The White House is putting
               heat on the EPA. They want us to
               announce a major investigation of
               the relation between power lines and
               cancer clusters.

               But didn't the EPA already do a study?

               Yeah, but when the draft got to the
               White House, they didn't like it. So
               they brought their own scientists in
               to kill it.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            99.


               Why did the White House change its
               mind?

               Who knows?

               Is there new evidence?

               Yeah -- their polls have dropped
               like a rock. They need an issue.
               This one makes them look good on
               the environment, and they don't have
               to spend a penny.

               And what good is this to me?

               Come on, congressman, in this town,
               information is currency. And
               advance information is gold.
      Reinhardt nods in agreement.

               But you've    got to move fast. Once
               the White    House goes public with
               this, they    can't turn back. If your
               friends at    the power company want to
               kill this    investigation, they'd better
               do it now.     Evening, gentlemen.

      After Homer leaves:

               Blueboy. Twenty to one. Is your
               Cousin Henry always right?

               I ain't got no Cousin Henry.

      Reinhardt dials.

               Hello?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             100.


               Mrs. Dodge, it's Arthur Reinhardt.
               May I speak to the Chairman, please?

               Hello?

               Are you sitting down?

      The Longworth Room, a small circular committee room with
      an ornate rotunda. The Arts Caucus breakfast is ending.


               Unless there is further business,
               our caucus stands adjourned.
      Dodge gets up.    As he makes to leave, Tommy comes in.

               Got a minute, Dick?
      Tommy takes him aside.    The room empties except for them.

               Listen, Dick, I heard something.
               There's got to be some bid'ness in it.
      Tommy very discreetly gestures with his thumb and palm:
      money.

               Maybe we can go in on it together.


               I'm listening.

               The EPA is going to make a stink
               about power lines. The White House
               is pushing them to do a big study.

               That's very interesting, my friend.
               I've heard that, too.

                      
               Nothing gets by, do it?
      Tommy touches his nose, in tribute to the master.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            100A.


               But thank you, son -- I'm glad you
               chose to share it with me. We do
               make quite a team, don't we?

               I -- I hope it wasn't my press conference
               that started this.

               No, this is a stunt for the polls.

               So do you think there's something
               in it for us?


                      
               If we got the EPA off Olaf Andersen's
               back, he'd be extremely appreciative.

               And how do we do that?

               My committee writes the EPA's programs.
               We audit their funds. We confirm their
               appointees. I've got them by the balls.

               And you're going to -- ?
      Tommy makes a squeezing gesture, grins.

               Oh, no, not at all -- just...
               persuasion. Strenuous persuasion.

               That's allowed?

               Persuasion, yes. Intimidation, no.
               But it's a gray area. Who's to say
               which is which?

               Dick, wait a minute -- shouldn't we
               check out the tip? Make sure the
               EPA's really going through with this
               investigation?


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             101.


               Of course.
                      
               He should be in by now.

               Who?

               Skeeter Warburton, of course.
               Always go right to the top, son.

      Dodge passes his Secretary's desk on the way into his
      office.

               Get me the EPA Administrator, please.

      Tommy jogs along the corridor. A tourist Family stares at
      him. He explains his haste with a smile --

               There's a vote on the floor.
      -- and ducks into the stairwell.

      In a chamber crammed with cables, the Telephone Man
      listens to a handset. He now sports a gold Rolex on his
      wrist -- his horse must have come in. Van Dyke, also
      there, looks at any array of dials and meters, whose
      hands all suddenly move. Some electronic phone CHIRPS,
      then the filtered RINGING of a call.

               Here he comes.
      The Telephone Man nods, adjusts some wiring, smiles
      satisfiedly.

               And there he goes.

      Loretta wears a beaded sling, which adds to her look.
      She is at Tommy's desk, watching his phone as it RINGS.
      Tommy comes in.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             102.


               The Administrator.
      Loretta picks up the phone.

               Office of the Adminstrator.
                      
               Thank you, I'll put you right
               through.
      She hands the phone to Tommy, who mimics the George
      Plimpton voice.

               Warbuton here.
                      
               Thank you.
                      
               Mr. Chairman! I do hope there's
               something I can help you with today.


               I need a straight answer from you,
               Skeeter. Is the White House on
               your ass about power lines?

               Off the record?

               Of course.

               I was looking forward to some
               serious sailing this week -- Tish
               and I have a lovely spot right by
               Kennebunkport. Instead, here I am
               at three in the morning, writing
               testimony to your committee about
               cancer clusters.

               Thanks for your candor, Warburton.

               Not at all. You must come sailing
               with us. Cheers. Bye-bye.
      Tommy passes the phone back to Loretta.

               Next.

      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            102A.


               Yes?

               Zeke Bridges on line two.
      Andersen punches the button to connect the call.


               I'll just put you through to him.
      She passes the phone to Tommy.


               Olaf?
                      
               Olaf, Zeke Bridges. Listen, you
               sum' bitch, I'm so mad, I can't
               sit down to shit. Have you heard
               what I heard?
                      
      INTERCUT with Andersen.

               What's that.

               The EPA's fixing to make a big
               stink about power lines and
               cancer. They're going to serve
               us up for breakfast.

               Wait a minute. There's no
               scientific proof --

               Proof don't mean shit. We're
               talking politics. They make a
               federal case out of power lines,
               I'm screwed. Whole insurance
               business is screwed. You know how
               much cash I'd have to pay out in
               settlements? Even if I stiffed
               everybody on claims, the legal
               fees'd be enough to kill me.

               I can't believe it.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             103.


               You better believe it. You're
               screwed, too. Every hot dog trial
               lawyer in America soon be lining up
               to sue both our asses. We got to
               move on this, Olaf. If I wasn't
               tied up here, I'd go to Washington
               myself. Shouldn't you be getting
               on a plane? Just between us -- you
               find a way to stop this, I'll find
               a million bucks if I have to.

      A very worried Andersen.


      Tommy and Dodge walking along a Capitol hallway.

               Olaf will be at my office at five o'clock.

               How do we play it?

               Cool. Real cool. You just follow
               my lead.



               I don't know how I can help you on
               this one, Olaf. This is the EPA.
               This is the President.

               This is my lifeblood!

               I see that, Olaf, I see that. But
               in this town, you pick your fights.

               This could mean six figures, Dick.
      Dodge says nothing, but makes his eyebrows fly.

               High six figures.
      Dodge flicks his eyebrows again:   More.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             104.


               Seven figures?

               Between us. It's not that much --
               what can you get for half a
               million these days?

               How the hell can I funnel that
               kind of money to you?

               If that's what you want, we can
               always find a loophole. No one
               will see your fingerprints.

               No one will know?

               No one will know.

               You're only in trouble if someone
               can prove a connection.

               Of course there's no connection.
               Olaf's just making a contribution
               as a patriotic citizen. And in
               return for it, he's getting --

               Good government.


               Exactly.   A little access, that's
               all.

      Dodge, Andersen, Tommy, and O'Connor walking along. Up
      ahead, a cocktail reception. On an easel by the door:


               I've got to do a drop-by. You
               gentlemen like to join me for a drink?

      Dodge and Tommy work the room genially. Tommy spots
      Celia talking to some Guests and goes over to her.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            105.


               Hi.

                      
               Excuse me.
      She turns, starts to walk away.   Tommy stops her.

               Look. Whatever you think of me,
               just promise me one thing.
      She glares at him angrily.   But then she's surprised to
      hear:


               Come to the Clean Air hearing
               tomorrow.

                       
               What?

               Power and Enterprise.    Noon.

               But why?
      He gives her an enigmatic smile and slips away.
      As he rejoins Dodge, Tommy SEES WARBURTON enter the room.
      Alarmed, TOmmy moves in on Dodge, steering him to avoid
      the EPA Administrator.


               Shouldn't we be heading off, Dick?

               Let's work the room just a bit more.

               Congressman!   Mr. Chairman!
      As Dodge turns to see him --

               Evening, Reinhardt.
      -- he SEES Warburton.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            106.


               Good to see you, sir.    By the way,
               I thought your opening   statement in
               committee yesterday was   brilliant.
      Dodge points out Warburton to Tommy.

               Well. Look who's over there --
               Skeeter Warburton from the EPA.
               The very man we want to see.

                      
               Have you tried the oysters, Dick?


               At a hazardous waste event?
                      
               I think we'll go talk to him.

               No, he's the wrong man --

                      
               You don't understand -- he's the
               perfect man.

               But -- but you don't want to bother
               him with this. Talk to one of his
               underlings --
      Dodge looks at Tommy with curiosity, not understanding his
      reluctance.


               Nothing beats man-to-man.

               Here?     Not here!

               A public place. What could be better?

               But it's the wrong time!

               While the iron is hot, son.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               107.


                      (chiming in
                       helpfully)
               No time like the present.

               Shut up, Reinhardt, I'm talking to
               the Chairman. Beat it, okay?

                      
               I'll go get him.
      Reinhardt heads for Warburton.


                      
               You heard about this stomach thing
               going around?

               Come on, son, we've got the
               people's business to do.
      He leads Tommy off to one side.      Reinhardt brings
      Warburton to them.

               Mr. Chairman.    Congressman.

               I've got a big problem, Skeeter.

               What's that?


               Your power lines investigation.

               What power lines investigation?
      Tommy is sweating bullets.

               We're off the record, Skeeter.
               This witch-hunt for cancer clusters
               is bad news for everyone.

               I don't know what you're talking
               about, Dick.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             108.


               Alright, I know you're being a
               good soldier --

               No, I'm being straight with you --

               Then let me be straight with you. You
               announce this study -- I'm not talking
               about the results down the road, mind you,
               I'm just talking about the announcement
               -- and there's broken crockery everywhere.
               Real estate. Utilities. Insurance.
               Schools. Local governments.
               It'll cost jobs. Uproot families.

               I agree with you completely. There
               isn't going to be an investigation,
               old chap, I promise you.

                      
               I'm glad we understand each other.

                      
               Yes, I think we do.
      Tommy silently rejoices in his good fortune.

               And we'll just forget about that
               phone call this morning?


               We didn't speak on the phone.

                      
               Excellent.
      Dodge claps him on the shoulder, then heads off with Tommy,
      who is delighted to have dodged a bullet.

                      
               "There isn't going to be an
               investigation, old chap."

                      
               You're bad.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           109.

      They join up with Andersen and O'Connor.

                      
               Worked like a charm. We scared him
               shitless. The investigation's dead.

               Waiter! Champagne!
                      
               See you at the Clear Air hearings.

      As Reinhardt comes into the office, Tommy intercepts him.


               Morning, Reinhardt! Got a minute?
               I need your advice on something.

               Sure.
      Tommy leads him back into the corridor.

      Van Dyke, Armando, and Loretta work the phones.

               Is this the assignment desk? Yes,
               I'm calling from Chairman Dodge's
               office, on the Hill. We wanted
               to be sure CNN was sending a crew
               to the Clean Air hearing today.


               No, not the new emission standards.
               We're breaking news. This is the
               biggest thing since Watergate.

               This is Cynthia Leeson in the White
               House Press Office. My boss wanted
               me to let you folks know -- we're
               making a major announcement at the
               Clean Air hearings today.
                      
               No, I can't tell you, but it's hot.
                      
               Well, if the New York Times wants
               to be the only paper in town to
               miss the story of the year, that's
               up to y'all.

      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              109A.

      Tommy has drawn Reinhardt into the cage.

               I want to do a little    something
               nice for Dodge. That     EPA thing --
               he's been good to me,    Reinhardt. Is
               there some way I can,    like, throw a
               bouquet to him at the    hearing today
               without having to sit    through
               that boring testimony    shit?

               Why don't you ask him to give you
               the floor at the start?


               He's do that?

               For some flattery? In a New York
               minute. Just tip him ahead of time.

               Good thinking.
      They return to the corridor.     Tommy looks at his watch.

               Say, Reinhardt, my Grandma's plane
               comes in at ten. You wouldn't mind
               picking her up and driving Miss
               Daisy around, would you?

               Can't one of the others do it?


               No, I don't trust them the way I
               trust you.
      TOMMY pats him on the back and sends him on his way.

      Tommy, joined by his cronies and the Jubas.

               This is it, people.     Game time.   Let's
               get it right.

               Tell me one thing, jefe. How do
               you know Andersen is going to bite?

               I don't.   You run a con, you run a risk.

      A hundred or so members of the public -- trade groups,
      Hill staffers, lawyers, tourists -- settle into their
      seats.
      VAN DYKE escorts Hattie Rifkin and a busload of Silver
      Foxes.
      Loretta comes in with Ellen and Mickey Juba.
      GRANDMA comes in, on Reinhardt's arm. She is dressed up
      as a biddy, down to a hat with fruit on it.
      COMMITTEE MEMBERS head for their seats at the dais.
      OLAF ANDERSEN is at the witness table, along with a couple
      of other businessmen. In a seat behind Andersen, Tommy
      O'Connor.
      THE PRESS.   A good turnout, with several camera crews.

               You know what this is?

                      
               It's very hot. Electric cars.
      CELIA is seated with Ira, her Pro Bono associate.

               I'm cutting out early.

                      
               Don't want to run into him?


               You got that right.
      AT THE DAIS Tommy has a private word with Dodge.

               Dick, I thought it might be a nice
               way to open if I congratulated you
               on the fine work you been doin'
               on this committee. Really express
               our appreciation. Especially on
               behalf of the minority community.

               Why, thank you, son.

               Wouldn't hurt to have tape like that
               in the bank, would it, Mr. Speaker?
      HOMER slips in next to Reinhardt, who is surprised to see
      him.

               Mr. Yancey? Arthur Reinhardt.      Are
               you testifying for the agency?

               mistaken -- let me introduce you.

               What the -- ?

      From the row behind Reinhardt, Armando clamps Reinhardt
      down.

               Move and you're history.
      DODGE GAVELS the meeting to order.

               This meeting of the Power and
               Enterprise Committee to consider
               the reauthorization of the Clean
               Air Act is now in session. Today's
               first business is a panel of
               national leaders in the field of
               utilities.



      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            112.


               Before I welcome them, Chair would
               like to yield to the gentleman from
               Florida for a word. If there is
               no objection from the Committee -- ?
               The gentleman may proceed.

               Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the
               other members of this committee,
               and on behalf of myself, I have a
               very personal statement to make.
               From the bottom of my heart, I want
               to thank you -- thank you for your
               leadership, for your insight, for
               your boldness...
      Dodge preens for the cameras, until:

               ... and for your courage.
               Especially your courage.

                      
               My courage?

               Your courage in exposing the
               corruption that eats away at this
               institution. Your courage in
               taking on the special interests.
               Your courage in taking a major new
               step --

               But I've... I've... I've done
               nothing new, nothing at all -- what
               are you talking about?

               You're    right -- integrity isn't new
               to you,    Mr. Chairman, it's second
               nature    to you. Still it's a rare
               public    servant who'll take on the
               special    interest money, take on the
               PACs --
      ANDERSEN, wary, senses danger.

               take on the lobbyists and fat cats --
      CELIA is fascinated.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            113.


                 ... and who'll stand up instead for
                 ordinary American citizens...


                 ... the plain people who just want
                 peace of mind -- who just want to
                 know they're raising their kids in
                 safe neighborhoods and sending them
                 to safe schools.
      ON THE DAIS Dodge wants to wrap this up.


                 Yes, courage, Mr. Chairman, is a
                 quality that you have in abundance --

                 Well, yes, thank you, but we have to
                 move along, if the gentleman would --

                        
                 Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday, the
                 Chairman and I had a meeting in his
                 office with Olaf Andersen of Gulf
                 Coast Power, and his lobbyist,
                 Mr. Tommy O'Connor --
                        
                 these gentlemen here. Chairman
                 Dodge and I listened in astonishment
                 as Olaf Andersen offered us seven
                 figures -- that's one million
                 dollars, ladies and gentlemen.

      A BUZZ in the room.   O'CONNOR leans forward to Andersen.

                 Dodge double-crossed us.

                 You're fired.


                 One million dollars, if we would
                 stop the EPA from investigating the
                 connection between power lines and
                 cancer clusters.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            114.

      Shocked MURMURS sweep the room. REINHARDT is aghast.
      HOMER and ARMANDO are delighted.

               Isn't that right, Mr. Andersen?
      Tommy flicks his eyebrows at Andersen, provocatively,
      imitating Dodge.

               That's a vicious lie.
      Dodge GAVELS sharply, turns to Tommy.

               Will the gentleman yield?

               That's not possible! You can't
               give anyone that kind of money!
      Dodge continues GAVELING.

               Oh, yes, you can. As Mr. O'Connor
               said to you, quote: "If that's
               what you want, we can always find
               a loophole. No one will know."
               Remember saying that, Tommy?

               I do not!

                      
               I insist that the gentlemen yield!

      Tommy also stands, and produces a video tape.

               You can't deny it, Mr. Andersen! We
               have the whole thing on this tape!
      The room erupts. THE PRESS loves it. Still cameras CLICK
      and WHIR. DODGE despairs. REINHARDT puts his hand over
      his face.

               Yesterday, at Chairman Dodge's
               courageous suggestion, I taped the
               whole conversation. It's all there.
               Mr. Chairman, I thank you. The
               people thank you. America thanks you.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               115.

      AUDIENCE APPLAUDS DODGE. The clapping is considerably
      sweetened by the Panthers and the rest of Tommy's claque.
      DODGE gauges their reaction, gets an inspiration. The
      storm leaves his face, and becomes a smile, which he
      beams on Tommy.

               I thank the distinguished gentleman.
               And I thank my fellow citizens. Our
               methods in this investigation may
               have been unorthodox, but together --
                      
               we have exposed a canker at the very
               heart of democracy.

      APPLAUSE. Tommy is amazed at Dodge's survival skills.
      REINHARDT, delighted at the turn, claps heartily.
      ANDERSEN, livid, leaps up and shouts at Dodge.

               You bastard!    You set me up!

               Witness is out of order!

               You stood to make a million bucks
               off of me! Who offered you more?
               I want to know!
      A new BUZZ sweeps the room. O'Connor tries to restrain
      Andersen, who sloughs him off.

               You're as big a whore as he is!
      MICKEY JUBA catches Tommy's eye and mouths a question.

               Now?
      Tommy shakes his head:   no.

      The phone by Eli Marshall's bed RINGS.    He answers.

               Hello?  No. You're joking.
                      
               You mind if I put on C-span?

      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            116.


               There's no loyalty any more, is
               there, Dick? What about the three
               hundred grand you squeezed from me
               for that goddam voter registration
               front of yours -- that just water
               under the bridge?
      O'Connor tries again to restrain him.

               Don't touch me, you scum!
      MICKEY JUBA mouths:


               Now?
      Tommy shakes his head again.    No.

               What about the two hundred k for
               your phony foundation, Dick?
               How about the ten thousand copies
               if your goddam autobiography you
               muscled me to buy -- what's all
               that, ancient history?
      Andersen advances toward the dais, pointing now to six or
      seven other Members of the Committee among the total of


               And you -- what about those bundled
               checks from my executives? I gave
               you my condo in Vail! I gave you my
               corporate jet to fly all over the
               world! I gave your kids summer jobs!
               I put up scholarships to put your
               kids through college! I hired your
               goddam wife to redecorate my office!
               You telling me none of that counts
               for anything?
      Andersen grabs Dodge by the throat.

               I thought you people were for sale!
               I was wrong -- you're just for rent!
      Dodge struggles free of Andersen, who is dragged away from
      Dodge by Capitol Police.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              117.


               How dare you impugn my integrity!
               Everything I've done has been
               completely legal!

                      
               Mr. Chairman! You mean to say you
               did all that stuff? You took all
               that money?
      Shock in the room. Some BOOS. IOWA does a nice HOG
      CALL. TJ sends a little wave and smile to Celia.

               There's nothing I've done that --
                      
               -- that these gentlemen haven't done!
      Committee Members rush to dissociate themselves from
      Dodge.

               No!... Not me!... Just him!... I
               never!... He crossed the line!

               They're whores! All of them!
      MICKEY JUBA tries again.

               Now?
      TJ nods yes.


               Throw the bums out!
      LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE.   She's touched a nerve.   TJ leaps
      into the moment.

               Damn straight! Throw the bums out!
               This place is an outhouse!
      ON THE PUBLIC. GASPS, WHOOPS, and APPLAUSE.    Reinhardt
      sinks lower and lower into his seat.

                      
               Throw the bums out! Throw the bums
               out!


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            118.

      Tommy, enjoying the triumph, can't help rubbing Dodge's nose
      in it.

               I owed you one.
      Dodge wheels on Tommy, exploding.

               You lowlife hustler! Who are you
               to talk? You got into this House
               through fraud. You think I didn't
               check up on you?
      He pulls a piece of paper from the pile at his place.


               Ladies and   gentlemen, I have here
               some rather   startling revelations
               about this   Mr. Johnson before you.
               This man is   nothing but a con man!
      A fresh BUZZ from the room.

               A common grifter!
                      
               He's wanted in three counties for
               bunco! He's a convicted swindler!
      Some BOOS.   REINHARDT emerges from his hole, encouraged.

               A fugitive from justice for card
               sharping, bookmaking, confidence
               games --



               -- and other charges the FBI has
               only begun to investigate! I dare
               you to respond!
      A hush in the room.

               You know what? He's right!     But
               let me tell you something --   all
               that's nothing, compared to   what I
               pulled here in Washington...   and
               this shit's all legit!


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            119.

      LAUGHTER and APPLAUSE.   Dodge BANGS the gavel repeatedly.

               The gentleman is out of order! The
               gentleman is out of order! This
               committee is adjourned!
      GRANDMA leaps to her feet.

               Stop banging! Stop banging!      That
               man has something to say!
      Massive APPLAUSE. Dodge is stunned by the enormity of
      the sentiment against him.


               Adjourned? Fine. Leave.
                      
               Turn your backs on the whole
               country. That what you want to
               do, gentlemen?
      The Members remain in place, paralyzed.

                      
               I'm a con man. A small-time con
               man. Do you know what it was like
               for me to come to Congress? It
               was for like dying and going to
               heaven. If I did back home the
               kind of scams I've run in Congress,
               my ass would be in Sing Sing. But
               no, I'm not a crook -- up here,
               I'm a distinguished gentleman!


      Eli, watching on television.

               Now don't get me wrong. They're
               not all bums. But boy, do the
               rotten fish stink up the barrel.
      Marshall APPLAUDS.   The Man in the next bed joins in.


               Now tell me, people -- while these
               guys are buying and selling each
               other, who's standing up for you?



      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            120.


               I'll tell you who. Nobody! Nobody
               gets five hundred bucks an hour to
               lobby for the average Joe! There's
               no Shnook PAC! There's no National
               Association for Ordinary Assholes!
               Sure, everyone's against cancer, but
               "everyone" doesn't have an office
               on K Street!
                      
               Don't you folks get it? We're
               supposed to be the people's lobbyists.
               Congress is supposed to be America's
               political action committee.

      APPLAUSE and SHOUTS of support. Several Members on the
      dais join the applause, seeing a winning issue.
      CELIA shakes her head in wonder.
      Tommy goes to Mickey and stands her up on a chair.

               She's right. Throw the bums out --
               starting with me! I'm gonna found
               me a new party. The Don't Vote For
               Me Party. Any of y'all want to
               join up?
      APPLAUSE and CALLS of enthusiasm.

               Well, come on, then! C'mon, get
               up, we got work to do!
      The room erupts, electrified, chanting.


               Throw the bums out! Throw the bums
               out!
      Tommy is engulfed by people and lights.
      Dodge, Andersen, and O'Connor -- desperate, snarling --
      are pinned to the wall by the SHOUTING Press Corps.
      Loretta AND GRANDMA watch Tommy bask in his new
      notoriety.

               That Miss Oprah's gonna love his
               ass.


      THE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               121-124.

      CELIA arrives where Tommy is standing.   She looks at him
      a beat. Then a big smile. They kiss.

               Tommy Johnson. Kamikaze congressman.

      Tommy and Celia walk down the steps, arm in arm.

               I can't wait to see that tape you
               made.
      Tommy pulls it from his pocket, glances at it, and tosses
      it away.

               Why? I bought it this morning.
               It's blank.
      As they continue down the steps, CAMERA CRANES UP to WIDE
      SHOT of the Capitol and the town beyond.
