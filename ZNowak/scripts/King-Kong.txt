          CLOSE ON: A scrawny MONKEY scratches.

          ANGLES ON: Defeated, listless ANIMALS, in the bleak environs of a
          dilapidated ZOO.

          WIDER: It is CENTRAL PARK ZOO in depression era NEW YORK. The PARK
          itself is like a GARBAGE DUMP, dotted with squalid SHANTY TOWNS.

          Against these BLEAK IMAGES, the SOUND of a BRIGHT, BRASSY SONG
          fades up: Al Jolson, singing "I'm Sitting on Top of the World".

          The sky line of MANHATTAN rises in the background, a grim steaming
          jungle on this cold FALL day.




          LONG continues over:

          IMAGES: The CROWDED STREETS of NEW YORK ... beneath the bustle is
          a sense of despair.

          LONG SOUP LINES snake along the STREETS.

          The HUNGRY search through RUBBISH BINS for FOOD. SKYSCRAPERS rise
          steadily upwards as more people are evicted from their homes.

          HOMELESS sleep amid steaming VENTS and GARBAGE STREWN GUTTERS.

                                                             Intercut:




          SONG continues over:

          SANNY, an old-time VAUDEVILLIAN, hurriedly fixes a large DROOPY
          MOUSTACHE on to a YOUNG WOMAN'S TOP LIP ... this is ANN DARROW.

          IMAGES: Weird and wonderful snatches of VAUDEVILLE ACTS follow ...
          singers, jugglers, boxing ladies.

                                                        Intercut with:




          The COLOR and MUSIC contrast with the SOUP LINES and SLUMPED
          SHOULDERS of the REAL WORLD.



          ANGLE ON: ANN on STAGE ... dressed as an ELEGANT GENT, she
          launches into `I'm Just Wild About Harry' with HARRY, a larger-
          than-life PERFORMER dressed in a FRILLY DRESS, BRASSY RED WIG and









          MANNY's CHARACTER joins in ... SNEEZING LOUDLY and causing ANN to
          take a SUDDEN PRAT FALL.

           nd so the ROUTINE BUILDS ... ANN and HARRY singing and dancing
          ... MANNY SNEEZING ... ANN falling.

          The AUDIENCE look on with bored expressions on their faces. All
          except ONE MAN at the BACK, who is LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.

          CLOSE ON: ANN throwing everything into her ACT ... SWEAT rolls
          down her face ... she tries not to get distracted by the LAUGHING,


          WIDER: A SMATTERING of APPLAUSE from the TINY AUDIENCE. 40 PEOPLE
          in a THEATRE designed for 500.

                                                             Crash cut:




          CLOSE ON: MANNY in the NOISY, CROWDED DRESSING ROOM, which is full
          of VAUDEVILLE PERFORMERS in various stages of undress.

          MANNY fires off a loud comical SNEEZE. He looks around at the
          others.


                    That's a funny one! Isn't that
                    funnier?


                    It's hysterical, Manny. As long as
                    we're laughing we won't be crying over
                    the box office. Talk about depressing.

          ANGLE ON: ANN sitting down at a MIRROR, starting to take off her
          VEST ... a book entitled "ISOLATION" by Jack Driscoll lies half
          open on the counter top nearby...


                    Twenty girls in feather boas prancing
                    around like circus ponies! That's
                    depressing!

          ANGLE ON: MAUDE, a BLOWSY SINGER, lighting up a cigarette.


                             
                    I love a good chorus line!

          CLOSE ON: ANN brushing her HAIR. TAPS, a young tap dancer, leans
          across and picks up the book.


                    What's this?


                    It's a play.






                    Who wrote it, Annie?


                    Some guy - Driscoll.
                              reading the jacket of book)
                    From the Federal Theatre.


                    Don't knock it, honey - at least they
                    get an audience.


                    It'll pick up .... Ain't that right,
                    Manny?

          The DRESSING ROOM goes suddenly quiet ... MANNY looks away,
          refusing to meet ANN's eye.

                              ANN 
                             
                    It always does.




          MANNY and ANN emerge from the STAGE DOOR, into an ALLEYWAY. Night
          and winter are setting in ...

          MANNY splutters out another LOUD SNEEZE.


                    The trick is to start the build right
                    at the back of your throat...
                             
                    Works well out through the nose too.


                    Have you eaten today?


                             
                    Oh, I'm not hungry. Don't worry about
                    me.

                    Hey - you're all I've got.

          ANN slips her arm through MANNY'S ...

                              ANN 
                    Come on - take me to dinner.


                    You think the kitchen'll still be open
                    on Third?







                    Soup and biscuits - perfect.

                                                                 Cut to:




          WIDE ON: The VAUDEVILLE THEATRE. The DOOR is chained closed.
          WORKMEN are up ladders, taking the HOARDINGS down SIGN and putting
          a large sign up: THEATRE CLOSED TILL FURTHER NOTICE ...


                             
                    Hey! Harry, what's going on?

          ANGLE ON: ANN ... rattling the HEAVY STEEL CHAINS that are     LOCKED
          around the DOORS to the VAUDEVILLE THEATRE ...

                              ANN
                    Hey, open up! We work here.

          A WORKMAN up a LADDER smirks down at her.


                    Not anymore.

          A MOTLEY collection of VAUDEVILLE PERFORMERS cluster on the
          SIDEWALK ... near them an incongruous assortment of PROPS and
          COSTUMES litter the STREET ...


                             
                    It's all right for you! We haven't had
                    a pay check in two weeks - how we
                    going to eat?


                    They're not going to get away with
                    this.

           LOSE ON: MAUDE looks bleakly at ANN ...


                    They just did.

          ANN tries to gather up PROPS - MANNY's BROOM, her TOP-HAT, HARRY'S
          parasol ...


                    Ann ... Annie! It's no use.

          ANN turns ... Manny is standing quietly to one side.

                               ANNY 
                    The show it's over - it's done.
                     'm done. I'm leaving, Annie ... I'm
                    going back to Chicago. I'm sorry ...

          ANGLE ON: ANN stares at MANNY in shock ..






                              MANNY 
                    I'm sorry, Ann. Ever since you were
                    small people have been letting you
                    down. But you gotta think of yourself
                    now. You should try out for that part.

          ANN looks at him warily ...

                              MANNY 
                    It's what you've always wanted. Oh, I
                    know what you're thinking - every time
                    you reach out for something you care
                    about ... fate comes along and
                    snatches it away.

          MANNY, grabs ANN'S hand ...

                              MANNY 
                    But not this time, Annie ... not this
                    time.

           LOSE ON: ANN as she digests MANNY'S words ... the LOUD rumble
          of an EL TRAIN thunders overhead ...




          ANGLE ON: WESTON, a NEW YORK THEATRE PRODUCER, strides out of
          his office, a copy of VARIETY tucked under his arm ...


                             
                    Oh, hello Mr. Weston?!

          WESTON turns and sees ANN ... he quickens his step.


                    Oh, Jeez ...

          ANGLE ON: ANN falls into step beside WESTON as he hurries
          along the BUSY SIDEWALK.

                              WESTON 
                    Look, Miss ... I told you already;
                    call my office - leave your resume
                    with my secretary.

          ANN doggedly follows WESTON ...


                    Why would I want to do that when we
                    can talk about it in person?


                    Because that's what a smart girl would
                    do.


                    But I already sent you my resume - you
                    returned it unopened.









                    What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
                    particular about who he works with.


                    Please, just an audition - that's all
                    I'm asking.


                     esus - you don't give up, do you?


                    Mr. Weston, I know this role
                    backwards.


                     ell, that's too bad - because we just
                    gave the part to someone else. Sorry,
                    kid - the play is cast.

          They are standing outside an ITALIAN RESTAURANT ... WESTON goes to
          enter ...

          ANN catches a glimpse of PLATES of FOOD and GLASSES of WINE. She
          quickly looks away. WESTON catches the glance and stops.

                              WESTON 
                    Look - I know times are tough. You
                    want my advice? Use what you got.
                    You're not bad looking - a girl like
                    you doesn't have to starve.

          HOPE flickers in ANN'S EYES as WESTON fishes into his POCKET
          for a PEN and BUSINESS CARD. He scribbles down an address.

                              WESTON 
                    There's a new place, just opened.
                             
                    Listen, princess - this gig ain't the
                    Palace, you understand? Ask for Kenny
                    K. Tell him I sent you.

          WESTON hands her the BUSINESS CARD ... ANN looks down at the
          address, not recognizing it. She looks at him questioningly.

                               ESTON 
                             
                    Just play the date, take the money and
                    forget you was ever there.

          PITH HELMET, stalking through undergrowth ... He raises his

          CAMERA, speaking soundlessly.







          CLOSE ON: A SLEEPY looking LION. A PIECE of MEAT is lowered
          into frame ... DENHAM appears briefly holding the MEAT. He is
          attempting to STIR the yawning ANIMAL into life. CAMERA TILTS
          UP briefly revealing the bars of a CAGE. PRESTON'S FACE appears

          above a CLAPPER BOARD ... "TAKE 5"

           LOSE ON: CARL DENHAM sitting in the smoky SCREENING ROOM. He
          is nervous ... his eyes flick from one INVESTOR to the other ...
          trying to read the room.


                    How much more is there?


                    Another five reels.


                    Lights up.

          Light floods the room as the washed out image on screen is
          extinguished.

          DENHAM notices a sleazy looking INVESTOR wake up with a start.


                    This is it? This is what we get for
                    our forty grand, Denham? Another one
                    of your Safari pictures?


                    You promised us romantic scenes with
                    Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie.


                    Come on, fellas - you know the deal -
                    we agreed to push Maureen's start date
                    so she could get her teeth fixed.


                    It's not the principle of the thing -
                    it's the money.


                    Carl - you've been in production for
                    over two months -


                    Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna
                    steam up the screen - once we get them
                    on the ship.


                    What ship?


                    The one we've hired to get to the
                    location.

          DENHAM hurriedly pulls himself up - as ZELMAN turns on him.







                    What location? Carl - you're supposed
                    to be shooting on the back-lot.


                    Yes, I understand that - but fellas,
                    we're not making that film anymore -
                    and I'll tell you why.

          DENHAM gets out of his SEAT and moves to the FRONT of the ROOM.

                              DENHAM 
                    The story has changed, the script has
                    been rewritten.

          DENHAM turns to face the room, whipping a TATTERED MAP out of his
          pocket.

                               DENHAM 
                    Life intervened! I've come into

                               growing excitement)
                    The soul surviving record of an
                    unchartered island, a place that was
                    thought to exist only in myth ...
                    until now!


                    Whoa! Carl - slow down!


                    Is he askin' for more money?


                    He's asking us to fund a wild goose-
                    chase.


                    I'm talking about a primitive world
                    ... never before seen by man! The
                    ruins of an entire civilisation - the
                    most spectacular thing you've ever
                    seen!

          SILENCE for a beat ... And then -


                    Will there be boobies?

          DENHAM is momentarily SPEECHLESS.


                    Excuse me, boobies?




                    Jigglies, jablongers, bazoomers! ...
                    In my experience people only go to
                    these films to observe the ...
                    undraped form of the native girls.


                    What are you - an idiot? You think
                    they asked De Mille to waste his time
                    on nudie shots? No - they respected
                    the film maker, they showed some
                    class! Not that you'd know what that
                    means - you cheap low-life!

          ZELMAN shifts uncomfortably in his seat as THUGGISH shoots him an



                    Would you step outside for a moment,
                    Carl?

          DENHAM looks at them ... the INVESTORS avoid EYE CONTACT.








          DENHAM points suddenly to the GLASS OF WATER on the TABLE next to



                    Gimme that - quick!

          PRESTON hands him the WATER.


                    You won't like it, it's non-alcoholic!

          DENHAM empties the GLASS into a POT PLANT.


                    Preston, you have a lot to learn about
                    the motion picture business.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM quietly places the GLASS against the SCREENING
          ROOM DOOR, and presses his ear against it.




          ZELMAN looks to the INVESTORS.


                    Don't write him off fellas. He's hot-
                    headed sure, but Carl Denham's made
                    some interesting pictures, he's had a
                    lot of ... near success.









                                
                       He's a preening self promoter ...




          CLOSE ON: DENHAM listening ...


                                
                       ... an ambitious no-talent! The guy
                       has "loser" written all over him.


                       Look, I understand your
                       disappointment.


                       He's washed up - It's all over town!


                       He can't direct. He doesn't have the
                       smarts.





                       This jumped up little turd's gonna
                       bankrupt us.


                       The animal footage has value?


                       Sure ... Universal are desperate for
                       stock footage.


                       Then sell it! Scrap the picture! We
                       gotta retrieve something from this
                       debacle.

           ELMAN nods ... gestures to the YOUNG ASSISTANT.


                       Get him back in.

          ANGLE ON: The YOUNG ASSISTANT opens the DOOR, steps into the LOBBY
          which is ...


                       Mr. Denham?











          ANGLE ON: DENHAM and PRESTON hurrying down the CROWDED SIDEWALK -
          struggling under the weight of 8 FILM CANS! DENHAM is glancing
          back over his shoulder.


                    I want the cast and crew on the ship
                    within the hour.


                     o Carl, you can't do this!


                    Tell `em the studio's pressured us
                    into an early departure.


                    It's not ethical!


                     hat are they gonna do - sue me? They
                    can get in line! I'm not going to let
                    them kill my film.

          ANGLE ON: PRESTON follows DENHAM, who steps off the curb ... and
          flags a CAB down. He cuts across the BUSY ROAD, PRESTON hurrying
          behind.


                     ou realize none of the camera
                    equipment is on board. We have no
                    permits ... no visas ...


                     hat's why I have you, Preston.


                    We have no insurance, no foreign
                    currency - in fact, we have no
                    currency of any kind -

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looks back across the STREET and notices an angry
          INVESTOR heading towards him.


                    Get in there!

          PRESTON suddenly finds himself BUNDLED into the back of a CAB.


                     ho's gonna pay for the ship?

          QUICK MOMENT: The SLEAZY INVESTOR grabs at the PARTIALLY OPEN BACK
          WINDOW of the CAB.


                    Get out of there!






          DENHAM hurriedly WINDS the WINDOW SHUT ... the SLEAZY INVESTOR
          yelps with PAIN, as he yanks his JAMMED FINGERS away from the CAB!


                       tep on it!


                               
                      You're finished, Denham!

          ANGLE ON: PRESTON sprawled on the SEAT, amid a PILE of FILM CANS,
          as the CAB speeds away!


                       on't worry Preston - I've had a lot
                      of practice at this: I'm real good at
                      crapping the crappers.






          AERIAL WIDE: DENHAM'S CAB cruises along the CROWDED STREETS of NEW



                      And two dozen of Mr. Walker's finest



                      Red label, 80% proof - packed in a
                      crate marked "lemonade".




          ANGLE ON: PRESTON and DENHAM sit on the BACK SEAT. PRESTON is
          feverishly scribbling on his NOTEPAD.


                      You got it ... and tell Maureen - she
                      doesn't have six hours to put on her
                      face. If she wants to be in this
                      picture, she's gotta be on that boat!


                      She doesn't want to be in this
                      picture.

          DENHAM looks at him blankly.

                                 RESTON 
                      Maureen pulled out.


                      She pulled out?!


                      Yesterday. I told you.








                             
                    You said we were shooting in
                    Singapore, right? That's what you told
                    her?


                    But we're not shooting in Singapore.


                              exasperation)
                    Goddammit, Preston! All you had to do
                    is look her in the eye and lie.

          DENHAM turns away, his brain whirring ... thinking hard ...

                              DENHAM 
                    I gotta get to a phone ... talk to
                    Harlow's people.


                     he`s unavailable.

          HIGH WIDE: DENHAM'S CAB wends it's way through BUSY NEW YORK
          streets ...


                    Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?


                    Mae West?! No! She has to be a size
                    four!




          ANGLE ON: PRESTON and DENHAM sit on the BACK SEAT.


                     ou gotta get a girl who'll fit
                    Maureen's costumes.


                             
                    Fay's a size four!


                     es she is, but she is doing a picture
                    with RKO.

          DENHAM looks away, muttering to himself ...


                     ooper huh?
                             
                    I might have known.









          ANGLE ON: The CAB screeches to a SUDDEN HALT in MID-TRAFFIC ...
          DENHAM jumps out, leaving PRESTON in protest ...


                    We gotta delay the shoot - shut
                    production down ... We can't sail
                    tonight!


                    Not an option.


                    Carl!


                    I said I'd find a girl.

          DENHAM turns and looks at PRESTON briefly.

                              DENHAM 
                    For Godsake, Preston - think like a
                    winner. Call Jack ... I need that
                    Goddamn screenplay!

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM leans in the window, PRESTON looks on PERPLEXED.

                              DENHAM 
                    Defeat is always momentary.

          DENHAM bangs the CAB ROOF with his hand, and then strides off
          confidently along the street.




          CLOSE ON: A series of PHOTOS of SEMI NAKED WOMEN, with feather
          boas and peacock fans ... gaudy banners proclaiming Miss Lily Rose
          ... Delaware Du Boise ... Velvet Cushions ...

           IDER: DENHAM is standing outside a tacky BURLESQUE THEATRE. He
          straightens his tie and heads towards the DOOR.

          ANGLE ON: A couple of LARGE GIRLS, followed by a SMALLER GIRL,
          arrive for work and enter the BURLESQUE THEATRE ... DENHAM eyes
          the BIGGER GIRLS, then chooses to follow the SMALLER ONE.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM is reaching for the DOOR HANDLE to go inside,
          when he suddenly pauses, his eye caught by the REFLECTION in the


           LOSE ON: ANN ... standing in the MIDDLE of the SIDEWALK. She is
          unaware of DENHAM watching her. ANN stares grimly at the BURLESQUE
          HOARDINGS, the FLYER clutched in her hands, a small knot of anger
          forming in her stomach.

           LOSE ON: DENHAM's HAND lets go of the DOOR. His eyes lock on ANN
          through the sea of PEDESTRIANS.






          ANN angrily CRUMPLES the FLYER, drops it in the GUTTER and walks

          away from the THEATRE.

           LOSE ON: DENHAM ... watching her leave.




          A BUSY FRUIT STALL on the SIDEWALK. The VENDOR is hurriedly
          handing out APPLES and pocketing NICKELS.

          ANGLE ON: ANN walks slowly by ... her eyes on the FRUIT. She
          glances at the VENDOR, SWIPES an APPLE from the TRAY, and quickly
          moves on, slipping the APPLE into her POCKET.

          ANN'S arm is suddenly GRABBED! The ANGRY VENDOR pulls her     hand
          out of her pocket, which is still clutching the stolen apple.


                             
                    You gonna pay for this?

          ANN tries to pull away. The VENDOR's grip on her arm tightens.


                    Excuse me ...

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM steps up behind them up HOLDING a NICKEL ...

                              DENHAM 
                    Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

          ANGLE ON: THE VENDOR snatches the NICKEL from DENHAM'S fingers.




          ANGLE ON: ANN is eating from a FULL PLATE, trying to disguise her
          HUNGER. DENHAM walks over carrying a CUP of COFFEE.


                    Vaudeville huh? I worked Vaudeville
                    once... that is a tough audience. If
                    you don't kill them fast, they kill
                    you.


                    Mr. Denham - I want you to know that
                    I'm not in the habit of accepting
                    charity from strangers, or for that
                    matter ... taking things that don't
                    belong to me.


                     t was obviously a terrible
                    misunderstanding.


                    It's just that, I haven't been paid in
                    a while ...







                              mock sincerity)
                    That's awful. Anyway, Ann - may I call
                    you Ann?

          DENHAM leans forward ... lowering his voice.

                              DENHAM 
                    ... You wouldn't happen to be a size
                    four by any chance?

          ANN pauses mid way through a mouthful of food, her appetite
          suddenly draining away. She abruptly stands.

                              DENHAM 
                    No! Oh God, no! You've got me all
                    wrong. Miss Darrow, please! I'm not
                    that type of person at all!


                    What type of person are you?


                    I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a
                    movie producer.
                             
                    Believe me, I am on the level, no
                    funny business. Please, sit down -
                    Please ... Please.

          ANN hesitates a moment before sitting down once again.

                              DENHAM 
                             
                    Ann, I want you to imagine a handsome
                    explorer bound for the Far East.


                    You're filming in the Far East?

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looking her in the eye and lying.


                    Singapore. On board ship he meets a
                    mysterious girl. She's beautiful ...
                    she's fragile ... haunted ...

          ANN looks up ... caught by the tale DENHAM is weaving.

                              DENHAM 
                    She can't escape the feeling that
                    forces beyond her control are
                    compelling her down a road from which
                    she cannot draw back. It's as if her
                    whole life has been a prelude to this
                    moment - this fateful meeting that
                    changes everything. And sure enough,
                    against her better judgement -




                    She falls in love.


                    Yes!


                    But she doesn't trust it. She's not
                    even sure if she believes in love.


                    Oh really?


                    If she loves someone - it's doomed.


                    Why is that?


                    Good things never last, Mr. Denham.

          An awkward pause ... ANN looks away, having revealed too much.
          DENHAM considers her a beat, realising something ...


                    So you're interested?

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM hurriedly gathering up his hat and coat.

                              DENHAM 
                    That's settled then. I don't want to
                    rush you - but we are under some time
                    pressure here.


                    Well I really -


                    Ann? I'm telling you, You're perfect -
                    look at you! You're the saddest girl I
                    ever met ... you're gonna make `em
                    weep, Ann - you're gonna break their
                    hearts!


                    See, that's where you're wrong, Mr.
                    Denham, I make people laugh, that's
                    what I do.

          ANN suddenly STANDS.

                              ANN 
                    Good luck with your picture.

          DENHAM follows ANN to the DOOR ...


                             
                    Ann! Miss Darrow! Please!





                    I'm offering NHAM
                              DE you money, adventure,
                    fame ... the thrill of a lifetime and
                    a long sea voyage. You wanna read a
                    script? Jack Driscoll's turning in a
                    draft as we speak.

          ANN stops and turns. A


                    Jack Driscoll?


                     ure. Why - wait! You know him?


                    Well, no - not personally. I've seen
                    his plays.

          DENHAM, sensing her interest, starts to get excited.


                    What a writer, huh? And let me tell
                    you Ann, Jack Driscoll doesn't want
                    just anyone starring in this picture.
                    He said to me, "Carl, somewhere out
                    there is a woman born to play this
                    role ..."
                              
                    And as soon as I saw you, I knew -


                             
                    Knew what?


                    It was always going to be you.

          SLOW PUSH IN on ANN as she realises she is standing on the brink
          of a life changing moment.




          ANGLE ON: The CROWDED DOCKS ... a clutter of SHIPS and SHANTY
          TOWNS. A CAB drives onto the DOCKS. DENHAM hops out and holds the
          door open for ANN, who emerges carrying a BATTERED SUITCASE.

          ANN stares at a LARGE OCEAN GOING LINER that rises above her.


                             
                    Is this the moving picture ship?


                    Not exactly ... it's actually this one
                    over here.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM is striding towards a RUSTY BATTERED TRAMP
          STEAMER on the OTHER SIDE of the WHARF! This is "The Venture".







                              DENHAM 
                    Don't let appearances deceive you.
                    It's much more spacious on board.


                    Haul away ...

          ROUGH looking SAILORS are working hard to get the boat under way.
          Hurried activity everywhere, crates being loaded; smoke begins
          pouring from the stacks ...

          DENHAM crosses and talks to MIKE and HERB who stand next to some
          film gear.


                    Is this all of the equipment? This is
                    all of it? We're taking the Bell and
                    Howell? Good. You got all the lenses -
                    you got the two and the six?


                    Carl!


                    Yes -
                              to MIKE and HERB)
                    Get it on board, fellas. Come on.

           NGLE ON: PRESTON hurrying down the GANGWAY. He rushes up to
          DENHAM ... his eyes flick to ANN, but he pulls DENHAM to one side.


                             
                    They're on their way. I've just had
                    word.


                    Who?


                             
                    Men in uniform. The studio called the
                    cops!

          A FLASH of FEAR crosses DENHAM'S FACE ... DENHAM calls across to
          a TALL FIGURE who is supervising the loading of the ship.


                    Englehorn! Cast off! Hoist up the
                    mainsail - raise the anchor, whatever
                    the hell it is you do - we gotta
                    leave.


                    I cannot do that ... we're waiting on
                    the manifest.


                    What? Who? English - please!








                             
                    Paperwork, Mr. Denham.

          DENHAM leans in conspiratorially ...


                             
                    I'll give you another thousand to
                    leave right now.


                    You haven't given me the first
                    thousand yet.

          DENHAM glances at ANN, flustered and embarrassed.


                    Can we talk about this later. Can't
                    you see we're in the company of a VIP
                    guest?

          ENGLEHORN's gaze falls upon ANN ...


                    Ma'am...


                    Ann Darrow.


                    So you are ready for this voyage, Miss
                    Darrow?


                    Sure...


                    Nervous?


                    Nervous - no. Why? Should I be?

          ANN looks taken aback ...


                    It isn't every woman who would take
                    such a risk.

          DENHAM throws PRESTON a look!


                             
                    Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her
                    cabin?


                    Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston.







                       Miss Darrow, if you'd just - Hi, my
                       name is Preston, Carl's assistant.

          DENHAM pulls his CHEQUE BOOK from his JACKET POCKET.


                       Two thousand - it's a deal ... Will
                       you take a cheque?


                       Do I have a choice?




          ANGLE ON: PRESTON goes to lead ANN up the GANG WAY past some rough-
          looking sailors, onto the SHIP - "THE VENTURE".


                       Please, follow me. If there's anything
                       that you need ... `excuse me fellas,
                       if there's anything that you need
                       please don't hesitate to ... ask ...

          PRESTON turns back to see ANN hesitating at the bottom of the GANG
          WAY ... an unnerved expression on her face ...

          ANN steps forward ... Deep breath, she follows PRESTON.




          BEEFY SAILORS shovel COAL into the SHIP'S FURNACE ... another
          cranks a valve on the pistons.




          ANGLE ON: DENHAM enters his CABIN looking FLUSTERED. He is
          STARTLED to find JACK DRISCOLL waiting for him. DRISCOLL is a
          WRITER, well dressed in a SHABBY sort of way.


                       Jesus, Jack - you scared me!

          DENHAM crosses to a cabinet and breaks into a CRATE OF JOHNNY


                                 DENHAM 
                       Listen, if anyone comes to the door,
                       don't open it. You haven't seen me ...
                       say I got depressed and committed
                       suicide. Say I stuck my head down a
                       toilet!
                                 holding up a bottle)
                       You want one?







                    No! I can't stay, Carl. I have a
                    rehearsal for which I am now ...
                              checks WATCH)
                    ... three hours late.

          JACK throws a FEW SCRIPT PAGES across the TABLE.


                    What's this?


                    It's the script.


                    This is a script? Jack ... this is
                    fifteen pages.


                    I know - but they're good! You've got
                    fifteen good pages there, Carl!


                    I'm supposed to be making a feature
                    length picture.


                    You told me I had more time. I'm
                    sorry. Look I gotta go.


                    Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I
                    have a beginning but I need a middle
                    and an end! I gotta have something to
                    shoot.

          The SHIP'S ENGINES roar into life ... JACK stands to leave.


                    You got my notes - I gotta go. See
                    you.

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM looking DISMAYED. He stares blankly at the RUSH
          of ACTIVITY through the PORTHOLE WINDOW behind JACK.

           OV: The VENTURE'S CREW hurriedly RELEASE ROPES in preparation for
          the ship's imminent departure.

          DENHAM'S expression slowly CHANGES ...


                    Alright, fine. We might as well settle
                    up.

          JACK looks ASTONISHED as DENHAM pulls out his CHEQUE BOOK.


                    You're going to pay me?







                    I'm not going to stiff a friend.


                    I've never known you to volunteer cash
                    before ...


                    How does two grand sound?


                    Sounds great!


                    Thought it might.

          DENHAM'S eyes flick to the WINDOW ... sees SAILORS are hauling up
          the GANGPLANK.

           NGLE ON: A SAILOR CRANKS a series of VALVES as the SHIP'S PISTONS
          crank in to life.

          DENHAM signs the CHEQUE, and hands it over with a FLOURISH ...

                                 DENHAM 
                                
                    Voila!

          JACK snatches the CHEQUE and turns to leave.


                    Thanks...

          JACK glances at it.

                              JACK 
                    Carl ... you've written "Two Grand".

          DENHAM takes the CHEQUE back ...


                    So I did ... Sorry about that
                             
                    Let's start from the beginning.

                              DENHAM 
                             
                    "Two Thousand Dollars" ...

          ANGLE ON: The ship's PISTONS PUMP faster.

          DENHAM looks up at JACK, a confused look on his face.

                              DENHAM 
                    It is the 29th, isn't it?


                             
                    Come on - it's the 25th, Carl, the
                    25th!






          ANGLE ON: JACK suddenly realises the SHIP is about to leave.


                    I'm sorry. Let me just ... It'll just
                    take a second.

          DENHAM screws up the CHEQUE again! The VIBRATION of the ENGINES
          picks up. JACK heads for the DOOR!


                    Never mind, pay me when you get back!


                             
                    Alright ... okay ...









          CRANE DOWN the stern of the ship as the PROPELLER kicks into
          action.




           NGLE ON: BRUCE BAXTER walking along the CORRIDOR, with PRESTON
          following behind laden with LUGGAGE. BRUCE is in his early
          thirties ... He is QUICK WITTED, SOPHISTICATED and CHARMING...
          but his career as a SCREEN ACTOR has badly stalled.


                    Your cabin's just down here,
                    Mr. Baxter. May I say how excited we
                    are to have you back with us, Sir.

          ANGLE ON: JACK is hurrying down the corridor towards the DOOR. He
          feels the SHIP MOVING! He suddenly collides with BRUCE, who
          thrusts a SUITCASE at him.


                    Be a sport and lend us a hand.


                    Oh, Christ!

          JACK looks desperately out of the PORTHOLE, doubles back and BOLTS



                             
                    Appreciate the help, fella.


                    Let me get the door for you - welcome
                    to your state room sir.









          ANGLE ON: BRUCE is clearly unimpressed with the TINY CABIN. He
          reacts to the SMELL.


                      know, that's not a nice smell is it?
                    I'm sure it'll disperse in a day or
                    two. Did I ever mention how much I
                    love your work, Mr. Baxter? I've seen
                    every one of your pictures ... even
                    the silent ones.


                    I haven't made any silent ones.

          BRUCE gently closes the DOOR in PRESTON'S FACE - leaving him
          silently CURSING to himself in the CORRIDOR.




          ANGLE ON: The PROPELLER CHURNS through the WATER ...

          ENGLEHORN watches the VENTURE pull away from the dock ...
          Satisfied, he enters the WHEELHOUSE ...


                    Dead slow ahead both, Mr Hayes.


                    Dead slow ahead both, Captain.




          ANGLE ON: JACK emerges from the labyrinthine SHIP INTERIOR and
          rushes to the RAIL of the SHIP ... he freezes in HORROR!


                    Oh Christ!

          ANGLE ON: The SHIP is PULLING AWAY from the DOCK ... 6 feet ...
          7 feet ... JACK contemplates JUMPING for a MOMENT:

                                 JACK 
                    Goddammit!




          POLICE CARS race along the docks towards the VENTURE, SIRENS
          wailing.




          JACK SLUMPS on the DECK in DESPAIR. He's missed his chance to
          get off the ship.






          DENHAM steps up behind JACK, just as a POLICE CAR, followed by
          ZELMAN and the INVESTORS, pull up on the DOCKS in the DISTANCE.


                    I keep telling you, Jack, there's no
                    money in theatre.






          The INVESTORS leap out of the car.


                    No, no, no!




          The VENTURE steams past the LIGHTS of MANHATTAN.


                    You're much better off sticking with
                    film.


                    I don't do it for the money, Carl. I
                    happen to love the theatre.


                     o, you don't.

          JACK looks at him exasperated as DENHAM casually taps his PIPE
          on the RAIL of the BOAT.

                              DENHAM 
                    If you really loved it, you would have
                    jumped.




          WIDE ON: ZELMAN throws his hat to the ground in anger as THE
          VENTURE pulls away from the docks.

                    I hope you find it to your liking...
                    it's quite comfortable. Your towels
                    and linens are underneath the bed.
                    That is the wash basin. I know, that's
                    not a pleasant smell - is it? I'm sure
                    it'll disperse in a day or two.

           RESTON dances over to the WARDROBE.

                              PRESTON 
                    The closet ... your costumes - I hope
                    you'll find everything is in order. If
                    there is anything that you need,
                    please do not hesitate to ask...fresh
                    water, perhaps? I can bring it to you
                    personally.

          PRESTON is interrupted by a knock on the CABIN DOOR...

          ANGLE ON: The DOOR opens and DENHAM enters. He thrusts a bottle of
          JOHNNY WALKER SCOTCH into ANN'S HANDS ...


                    Knock knock! We can't have our leading
                    lady deprived of the necessities of
                    life.
                              to PRESTON)
                    Do me a favour - run a bottle down to
                    Jack. It'll fend off his migraine.


                    They're still trying to find a place
                    for him to sleep.


                             
                    You told him my typewriter is
                    available for hire?


                    Yes - he didn't take it well.

          PRESTON departs down the corridor.


                             
                    Mr. Driscoll ...?

          DENHAM turns and looks at ANN.

                              ANN 
                    He's on board?


                    Jack has his heart set on coming. Call
                    me a softie - I couldn't say no.






          ANGLE ON: CHOY is showing JACK to his sleeping QUARTERS, carrying


          JACK stares in DISBELIEF at the DINGY HOLD strewn with STRAW
          BALES and EMPTY ANIMAL CAGES. He reacts to the SMELL.


                    This room very comfortable, plenty dim
                    light ... fresh straw.


                    What'd you keep down here?


                    Lion, tiger, hippo - you name it.

                              Jack
                    What, do you sell them to Zoos?

                    Careful! Camel have bad accident on
                    floor. Stain unremovable ...

          JACK looks down. He's standing in a dark, viscous PUDDLE OF GUNGE.

                              CHOY

                    Choy!

          ANGLE ON: CHOY clams up as ENGLEHORN strolls into the hold.

                              ENGLEHORN 
                    My apologies for not being able to
                    offer you a cabin. Have you found an
                    enclosure to your taste?


                             
                    Spoilt for choice.

          ENGLEHORN surveys a COUPLE OF LARGE CAGES.


                    What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or
                    a chimpanzee?

          JACK opens a CAGE large enough to sleep in.







                    Maybe, I'll take this one.

          He steps back with SURPRISE as a WOODEN CRATE TOPPLES, spilling
          out a LARGE MEDICAL BOTTLE. CHOY looks up in SHOCK as the BOTTLE
          ROLLS towards ENGLEHORN who coolly TRAPS it with his FOOT.


                    I told you to lock it up.


                             
                    Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said -


                             
                    Lumpy doesn't give the orders. What
                    are you trying to do? Put the whole
                    ship to sleep? Get them out of here!

          ENGLEHORN hands the BOTTLE to a nervous CHOY. JACK stares at the
          CRATES stacked in the CAGE.

          CLOSE ON: Piles of BOTTLES, all marked "Chloroform".

           NGLE ON: BRUCE pins movie posters from some of his previous films
          on his cabin wall ... He steps back, admiring them.




          ANGLE ON: JACK, sitting in the hold, TAPPING on an OLD TYPEWRITER
          propped up on BOXES. He is clearly very QUEASY, as he tries to
          stay focussed on the TYPEWRITER KEYS.

          He sees JIMMY carrying a TRAY come into view, he COUGHS and CLAMS



                    Compliments of the chef -

          ANGLE ON: JIMMY unloading the BOWLS of GREY looking STEW from the


           LOSE ON: JIMMY puts the BOWL next to JACK ... who takes one look
          at it, and SQUEEZES his eyes closed.


                    Oh Christ - oh God!


                    Lambs brains in walnut sauce.







          The CAGES and ROPES SWAY with each roll of the WAVES ... JIMMY
          walks away.

          ANGLE ON: JACK looking very nauseated ...


                    Jimmy!

          JIMMY spins round, a guilty look on his face.

                              HAYES 
                    You run those ropes up on deck like I
                    told you?


                    Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

          ANGLE ON: JIMMY tries to slip past, but HAYES grabs his WRIST.


                    How about you return Mr. Driscoll's
                    pen first?

          CLOSE ON: An expensive FOUNTAIN PEN drops from JIMMY'S HAND and
          clatters to the floor. QUICK as an eel, JIMMY scampers AWAY.

          HAYES shakes his head, and picks up the PEN ... hands it back.

                               HAYES 
                    He doesn't mean any harm. I'll keep
                    him out of Jyour way.


                    No, it's okay.


                    It's just he likes it down here, it's
                    where I found him ... four years ago
                    ... stowed away in one of them cages.
                    His arm was broken in two places, he
                    was wilder than half the animals in
                    here. Still won't tell me where he
                    came from - all I know, it wasn't any
                    place good.




          ANGLE ON: JIMMY is sorting NETS up on DECK. Nearby HAYES rests
          against the railing.


                    You gotta straighten up. You don't
                    want to be on this ship for the rest
                    of your life.


                    I do.




                    No, you don't, Jimmy. You wanna get
                    yourself educated. Give yourself some
                    options. Take this serious.


                    I do, Mr. Hayes, I do! Look, I've been
                    readin'.

          JIMMY pulls a battered book out of his coat pocket. HAYES takes
          the book. It has a painting of a TRAMP STEAMER on the cover and
          the title: HEART OF DARKNESS by Joseph Conrad.


                    Where did you get this?


                             
                    I borrowed it ...

          HAYES flicks the book open and sees "Property of New York
          Public Library" stamped on the interior of the dust jacket.

                              JIMMY 
                    ... on long term loan. Look at this.

          JIMMY points to the printed byline on the back of the book.

                    "Adventures on a Tramp Steamer". See -

          ANN is holding a copy of JACK'S PLAY "ISOLATION" ... she is
          standing in front of a mirror rehearsing her introduction.


                    It's nice to meet you Mr. Driscoll -
                    I'm actually quite familiar with your
                    work.
                              
                    Oh yes! ... Hello, Mr Driscoll - it's
                    so nice to meet you! Actually, I'm
                    quite familiar with your work. I'm a

                    I've read everything you've ever
                    written.

          ANN'S face falls in DESPAIR - she can't get rid of her nerves
          about meeting the famous JACK DRISCOLL.






          A few sailors are finishing BREAKFAST.

          PRESTON, HERB and MIKE are seated at a TABLE.

          ANGLE ON: MIKE packing away his HEADPHONES and SOUND RECORDING


                    I'm gonna have the ships' engines all
                    over the dialogue - sea gulls, camera
                    noise, wind and Christ knows what
                    else!


                    I don't care, Mike! You're the sound
                    recordist - make it work.

          ANGLE ON: ANN in the CHIFFON DRESS, hesitating in the doorway of
          the MESS.

          DENHAM looks up and signals her over.

                    Ann! Come on in! Let me introduce you
                    to the crew! This is Herb - our
                    cameraman ...

          ANN reaches out to shake HERB'S hand.


                    Delighted to meet you, ma'am. And may
                    I say what a lovely dress.


                    Oh! This old thing! I just - threw it
                    on!


                             
                    Isn't that one of Maureen's costumes?


                             
                    What does a girl have to do round here
                    to get some breakfast!


                    Lumpy! You heard the lady!

          ANGLE ON: LUMPY looking up. He is simultaneously shaving a
          SAILOR and stirring PORRIDGE.


                    Fancy some of me ... ah ... Porridge
                    aux walnuts?







          DENHAM turns back to ANN, who is staring at MIKE, who has his
          head down, scribbling in a NOTEBOOK.


                    ANN, I don't believe you've met -


                    That's alright Mr. Denham, I know who
                    this is ...

          ANGLE ON: ANN, who is staring at MIKE in quiet awe. He glances up
          at her, nervously.

                              ANN 
                    Thrilled to meet you. It's an honour -
                    to be part of this.


                             
                    Gee, thanks!


                    Actually - I am quite familiar with
                    your work.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM raises a quizzical EYEBROW.


                    Really?


                    Yes, and what I most admire - is the
                    way you have captured the voice of the
                    common people.


                    Well - that's my job.


                    I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr
                    Driscoll, if you don't mind me saying -
                    you don't look at all like your
                    photograph ...

           NGLE ON: JACK at the bar, holding a cup of COFFEE. He turns
          and glances at ANN.


                    Excuse me?


                    Wait a minute! Ann -


                             
                    Well, he's so much younger - in

                    And much better looking.






          JACK starts to walk over to the table.


                    ANN! Stop! Stop - right there -

          ANGLE ON: MIKE staring past ANN'S shoulder.


                    I was afraid you might be one of those
                    self obsessed literary types. You know
                    - the tweedy twerp with his nose in a
                    book and his head up his -

          JACK snaps his BOOK closed. ANN turns around ... her face drops.
          JACK looks at ANN, who stares at him MORTIFIED.


                    It's nice to meet you too, Miss
                    Darrow..




           RUCE bumps into JIMMY who hurries away looking shifty.

          BRUCE enters his CABIN ... A moustache has been drawn on all his
          POSTERS. BRUCE looks annoyed ... then takes another look.

          CLOSE ON: BRUCE glancing in the mirror - imaging himself with a
          moustache. Not bad.




          WIDE ON: The VENTURE ploughs through a HEAVY SWELL.


                    She's standing at the railing ... she
                    doesn't know it yet, but they're
                    sailing towards disaster. You got
                    that?


                    She turns ... The First Mate is
                    staggering towards her - there's a
                    knife sticking out of his back!




          ANGLE ON: JACK, sitting in the hold, TAPPING on an OLD TYPEWRITER
          propped up on BOXES. He is clearly very QUEASY, as he tries to
          stay focussed on the TYPEWRITER KEYS.

          DENHAM is pacing the HOLD, sucking on a PIPE.


                     ait a second, we're killing off the
                    First Mate?






                    That's assuming she knows who the
                    First Mate is.


                    Come on, Jack! It was an honest
                    mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it
                    could happen to anyone.


                    I was joking, Carl.


                    The point is: she's horrified. She has
                    to look away. And that's when she sees
                    it.


                    See's what? What?

          ANGLE ON: Unseen by either DENHAM or JACK, JIMMY has snuck down in
          to the HOLD ...


                             
                    The island.


                             
                    We're filming on an island now? When
                    did this happen?


                    Jack, keep your voice down! I don't
                    want the crew getting spooked.


                    Why would they get spooked? What's it
                    called?

          DENHAM looks SHIFTY.


                    All right ... It has a local name, but
                    I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't
                    sound good.

          ANGLE ON: JIMMY, his attention caught as he eavesdrops on the
          conversation.

          JACK looks at DENHAM in GROWING FRUSTRATION.

                              DENHAM 
                             
                    They call it ...
                             

          JIMMY POV: DENHAM leaning in and murmuring to JACK.






                    What's wrong with this place?


                    There's nothing officially wrong with
                    it. Because technically it hasn't been
                    discovered yet.

          JACK gives up, feeling too seasick to argue ...


                             
                    Okay ... alright ... so we arrive at

                    this place ...
                               typing)
                    S ... k ... u ...

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks up in time to see JIMMY listening ... Their
          eyes meet ... DENHAM tries to hush JACK - too late.

                              JACK 
                    l ... l ... Island.




           NGLE ON: The SHIP moves through GREY SEAS ... Dolphins swim
          alongside.




           IDE ON: DENHAM is FILMING ANN and BRUCE. Clustered around are his
          crew, HERB and MIKE and PRESTON.


                    All right everyone, from the top.   And
                    ... action!

          ANGLE ON: BRUCE saunters up to ANN, who is leaning on the rail,
          staring out to sea, in full hair and make-up.


                    I think this is awfully exciting! I've
                    never been on a ship before.


                    I've never been on one with a woman
                    before.


                    I guess you don't think much of women
                    on ships, do you?


                    No, they're a nuisance.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looking intently at JIMMY and HAYES who are
          further down the DECK ... talking quietly.






          ANGLE ON: HAYES shoots DENHAM an ALARMED LOOK.


                    Well, I'll try not to be.


                    Just being around is trouble.


                    Well! Is that a nice thing to say!


                    It's a dangerous thing, having girls
                    on ships. They're messy and they're
                    unreliable!


                             
                    Cut! Great!

           NGLE ON: DENHAM'S gaze returns to JIMMY and HAYES who are huddled
          in a group with three more SAILORS ... word is travelling fast.

                              DENHAM 
                    Bruce, wonderful performance. You can
                    relax for ten minutes.

          ANGLE ON: BRUCE looking pretty pleased with himself.

                              DENHAM 
                    That was very natural... I felt moved.

          JACK looks on in disbelief.


          ANGLE ON: BRUCE walking past JACK ...


                     hat do you think, Driscoll? The
                    dialogue's got some flow now - huh?


                    It was pure effluence.


                        beefed up the banter ...


                    Try to resist that impulse.


                    It's just a little humor, Bud - what
                    are you, a Bolshevik or something?

          JACK watches as BRUCE saunters off ... he turns back to DENHAM.


                    Actors. They travel the world but all
                    they ever see is a mirror!







          JACK looks up to see ANN looking dismayed, a MIRROR COMPACT, in
          her hand ...

          She quickly snaps the COMPACT shut and turns away.

          CLOSE ON: JACK - taken aback.




          ANN is making her way to the BATHROOM. She looks up as JACK
          rounds a corner coming the other way. They walk toward each
          other.

          SUDDENLY the ship sways, JACK is thrown forward, but ANN
          manages to hold her BALANCE.


                    Good legs.

          ANN looks at him SHARPLY.

                              JACK 
                    Sea legs - I meant - you know ... sea
                    legs. Not that you don't have good
                    legs, I was just ...

          JACK trails off as ANN edges past him, averting her eyes.

                              JACK 
                    ... making conversation. Jesus!
                             
                    Miss Darrow!

          ANN stops and turns ...

                              JACK 
                    About the scene - today, with you and
                    Bruce -


                    I know, it wasn't what you wrote. But
                    Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when
                    a man likes a woman - then he must
                    ignore her. And if things turn really
                    hostile ... no?


                    Interesting theory.


                    I know ... I should have -


                    It wasn't what I had intended ... but
                    it -


                    I'm sorry - I was ...








                    You made it your own ...


                    I was nervous.


                    It was funny, actually ... you were
                    funny.


                    Please - don't say another word. Good
                    night.

          ANN goes to close her CABIN DOOR.


                    Miss Darrow ...

          ANN looks at him.

                              JACK 
                    You don't have to be nervous.




          CLOSE ON: DENHAM standing behind the CAMERA with HERB and MIKE.
          DENHAM is caught up in the scene and is EMOTING FURIOUSLY.

            NGLE ON: ANN RUNNING out on to the DECK of the VENTURE in a
          GLITTERING GOWN. She is SIGHING and CRYING in a MELODRAMATIC kind
          of way ...

           NGLE ON: JACK approaching, he is reading pages in his HAND,     he
          looks up just as ...

          ANN turns, TEARS on her cheeks.. lit by the GOLDEN RAYS of the


          ANN stares at JACK, momentarily forgetting where she is. He stares
          back at her.

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM catching the EXCHANGE of LOOKS. He takes the
          script pages off JACK and shoos him away ...




          ANGLE ON: DENHAM &amp; ENGLEHORN talk out the front of the WHEELHOUSE.




          CLOSE ON: ENGLEHORN'S POV of SHIPPING CHARTS.


                    We're close. Head south-west.






          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN leaning over SHIPPING CHARTS. DENHAM hovers
          nearby in the doorway.


                    There's no land south-west for
                    thousands of miles. It takes us way
                    outside the shipping lanes.

          ENGLEHORN turns and confronts DENHAM.

                              ENGLEHORN 
                    I won't sail blind in these waters.


                     'll make it worth your while.

           NGLE ON: ENGLEHORN ... tempted by the offer of more money, but
          his instincts are telling him to not to agree.


                    There's nothing out there.


                     hen you've nothing to lose.

          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN: conflicted.




           IDE ON: THE VENTURE steams on as the SUN falls slowly behind the
          horizon ...




          ANGLE ON: DENHAM &amp; PRESTON are seated at a table, talking quietly.

          ANGLE ON: HAYES enters the MESS ... HAYES saunters over to PRESTON



                    If someone were to tell you this ship
                    is headed for Singapore, what would
                    you say?






          ANGLE ON: LUMPY is standing quietly honing a knife with a whet-
          stone ... it makes a L
                               sharp sound ...


                    I would say they was full of it, Mr.
                    Hayes. We turned south-west last
                    night.

           LOSE ON: DENHAM looks up sharply ... HAYES is standing over him.


                    Gentlemen please, we're not looking
                    for trouble -

          ANGLE ON: JIMMY enters the MESS from behind him...


                    No. You're looking for something else


          PRESTON glances warily at DENHAM. DENHAM takes in the situation
          and decides to front up.


                             
                    Yes .... we are. We're gonna find
                    Skull Island! We're gonna find it,
                    film it and show it to the world. For
                    twenty five cents you get to see the
                    last blank space on the map!


                    I wouldn't be so sure of that.


                    What do you mean?


                    Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we
                    were working our passage on a
                    Norwegian barque.


                    We picked up a castaway - found him in
                    the water - he'd been drifting for
                    days.


                    His ship had run aground on an island,
                    way West of Sumatra. An island hidden
                    in fog. He spoke of a huge wall, built
                    so long ago - no one knew who had made
                    it ... A wall a hundred foot high ...
                    as strong today as it was, ages ago.


                    Why did they build the wall?









                    The castaway - he spoke of a creature,
                    neither beast nor man, but something
                    monstrous, living behind that wall...


                    A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's
                    how all these stories start.


                             
                    What else did he say?


                    Nothing. We found him the next morning
                    ... he'd stuck a knife through his
                    heart.

           NGLE ON: PRESTON looking ASHEN ... DENHAM breaks the GRIM MOOD.


                     orry fellas, you'll have to do better
                    than that. Monsters belong in B
                    movies!

           NGLE ON: PRESTON &amp; DENHAM making a rapid exit.


                    If you find this place -

          DENHAM and PRESTON stop and turn back ...

                              HAYES 
                    If you go ashore with your friends and
                    your cameras ... you won't come back
                    ... Just so long as you understand
                    that.




          The ENGINEERS shovel more COAL into the FURNACE ... The relentless
          rhythm of the SHIPS PISTON'S PUMPING UP and DOWN continues ...




          PRESTON LYING AWAKE FREAKING OUT intercut with close ups of THE


          WIDE ON: THE STERN of the VENTURE cuts through the swell then
          AERIAL up over the top of the boat.




           t is late at night. JACK sits on his make shift bed, his
          typewriter balanced on his lap ... intent on what he is writing.










          ANGLE ON: ANN DANCING with JIMMY, much to the AMUSEMENT of
          GATHERED CREW ... CHOY is singing Marie's Wedding accompanied   by
          some SAILORS playing various MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS.

          CLOSE ON: JACK watching her ...




           NGLE ON: JACK continues typing.




          ANGLE ON: DENHAM scanning the HORIZON with BINOCULARS, ENGLEHORN
          comes out of the WHEELHOUSE ... some charts in his HAND ...




          HAYES is manning the WHEEL. ENGLEHORN is staring at the CHARTS, a
          CIGARETTE in his hand. There is a PALPABLE sense of tension in
          the AIR.


                             
                    How long do you expect us to stay out
                    here?

          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN puts his cigarette out, ignoring HAYES.




          ANN is pacing the cabin. She is wearing a SHAWL over pyjamas. She
          smiles as she turns pages of a loose leaf manuscript. ANN looks up
          at JACK.


                             
                    You're writing a stage comedy?


                    I'm writing it for you.

          ANN looks at him, taken aback.


                    Why would you do that?


                    Why would I write a play for you?


                    Yes.







                    Isn't it obvious?


                    Not to me.


                    Well, it's in the sub-text.


                    I guess I must've missed it.


                    It's not about words ...

          ANN looks at him uncertainly ... as JACK moves towards her ...

          He takes her in his arms and kisses her.






          CLOSE ON: THE RADIO OPERATOR receiving MESSAGE.






          CLOSE ON: JACK and ANN still KISSING.






          ANGLE ON: The RADIO OPERATOR hands a piece of paper to ENGLEHORN.


                    Message for you, Captain.

          slowly turns ...

                    What's going on?









          HAYES manning the WHEEL, looks at DENHAM briefly ...


                    Hayes! Why are we turning around?

           LOSE ON: ENGLEHORN enters the CABIN ...

                    Outside!





                    There's a warrant out for your arrest.
                    Did you know that? I've been ordered
                    to divert to Rangoon.


                     nother week - I haven't got a film
                    yet. Please - I have risked everything
                    I have on this!


                    No, Denham - you risked everything I
                    have.     D

                    What do you want? Tell me what you
                    want? I'll give you anything.

          ENGLEHORN regards DENHAM with cool detachment ...


                    I want you off my ship.

          ENGLEHORN heads back to the DOOR of the WHEELHOUSE.

                              ENGLEHORN 
                    Set a course for Rangoon, Mr Hayes.




           IDE ON: The VENTURE as it ploughs through the SWELL.




          DENHAM is leaning over the railing.




                    I'm finished. It's over for me, Jack.


                    How did you think this would end,
                    Carl?




          CLOSE ON: HAYES at the WHEEL, looking down at the SHIP'S
          COMPASS ... it is swinging wildly to and fro.


                             
                    Captain ...

          CLOSE ON: ENGLEHORN looks at the compass with CONCERN. He takes
          the wheel from HAYES.


                    Check our position. Use the stars.

          ANGLE ON: HAYES steps outside the WHEELHOUSE, carrying a
          SEXTANT. ... he looks up at the SKY and his face hardens with
          concern.

          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN looks across as HAYES appears at the



                             
                    There are no stars, Captain.






          CLOSE ON: The MAP as it SLOWLY rotates in JACK'S HANDS.

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM leaning on the RAILING staring absently out to
          SEA. Behind him JACK is looking at the MAP in his HANDS.


                    What is that?


                             
                    What?

          CLOSE ON: JACK'S EYE is caught by something on the PAPER. He
          shifts the MAP around, turning it upside down.


                    That.

          JACK walks over to the railing and hands the MAP to DENHAM.







                    I don't know ... what is it, a coffee
                    stain?

          DENHAM looks hard at the map, suddenly a look of intrigue dawning
          on his face.

          SLOW PUSH IN on a STRANGE SMUDGE-LIKE MARKING ...

           LOSE ON: DENHAM is CAPTIVATED ...

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM slowly looks up from the MAP, a look of HOPE
          kindles in his EYES.

          CLOSE ON: the STRANGE SMUDGE-LIKE MARKING. An IMAGE begins to
          become clear - a GORILLA-LIKE FACE.

          ON THE SOUNDTRACK: the sudden blast of the SHIP'S FOG HORN.

          DENHAM's eyes shift upwards ...

          AT THAT MOMENT a GUST of WIND plucks the MAP from DENHAM'S HAND
          and blows it overboard ... whirling it out to SEA ...




          ANGLE ON: The MAP FLOATING on the INKY WATER as the VENTURE
          steams away ...

           .. into a HUGE BANK of FOG that seems to melt out of the


          Another BLAST from the FOG HORN echoes across the silent ocean.




           RESTON moves along the DECK ... Staring uneasily at the FOG.

          VARIOUS ANGLES: Even the seasoned crew look unnerved.

          ANGLE ON: JIMMY up in the CROW'S NEST ... he is reading HEART     OF
          DARKNESS by torchlight.




           IDE ON: The VENTURE sails into THICKENING FOG.




          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN at the WHEEL ... he barks at the HELMSMAN.


                    Station the for'head lookout, and get
                    me the depth by lead-line!






                    Aye, Captain.

          The HELMSMAN hurries away.




          WIDE ON: The VENTURE steams through the FOG BANK ...

          ANGLE ON: A CREWMAN throws a LEAD-LINE over the side. CONCERNED
          CREWMEN hurry to their stations.


                             
                    Thirty fathoms ... no bottom!




          HAYES is tense. ENGLEHORN remains focussed, his eyes fixed ahead.


                    Reduce speed, steerage way only.

          HAYES swings the TELEGRAPH LEVERS.


                    Dead slow ahead, both.
                             
                    You should stop the ship.

          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN spins the WHEEL.


                    15 degrees Port.
                             
                    We're getting out of here, Mr. Hayes
                    ... we'll find clear conditions.


                             
                    We have seabed!

          CLOSE ON: HAYES rushes out of the WHEELHOUSE.




          ANGLE ON: the CREWMAN with the LEAD LINE shouts up at HAYES.


                             
                    Twenty-five fathoms!




          ANGLE ON: HAYES rushes to the WHEELHOUSE DOOR.







                    We're shallowing!

          ENGLEHORN looks with despair at the THICKENING FOG ahead. He
          starts spinning the WHEEL.


                    20 degrees starboard!


                             
                    Captain, you don't know where the hell
                    you're going!

          ENGLEHORN glares at HAYES.


                    Get me another reading!

          HAYES leaves ...


                             
                    Another reading!




          ANGLE ON: JACK looks alarmed as CREWMEN hurry past.

          DENHAM walks away from him, towards the front of the SHIP.


                    Twenty-two fathoms!




          ENGLEHORN peers uneasily out at the FOG ...


                    Douse the lights!

          ANGLE ON: JIMMY looking around ... confused.

          CLOSE ON: JIMMY'S eyes SUDDENLY WIDEN in DISBELIEF ... he leaps to
          his feet, unable to summon the power of speech!






          ANGLE ON: A HUGE ROCK FACE looms out of the FOG straight AHEAD!


                             
                    Wall! There's a wall ahead!!!




          ENGLEHORN ... a look of DISBELIEF on his FACE.





           IDE ON: The VENTURE sails directly towards a HUGE WALL which
          rises up 200 feet into the sky! The SHIP is DWARFED by the
          monstrous structure.




          ENGLEHORN stares at the LOOMING WALL, unable to believe his
          eyes ... he starts SPINNING the WHEEL hard to STARBOARD!


                    Stop engines!

          ANGLE ON: HAYES slams the TELEGRAPH to "STOP"




          ANGLE ON: DENHAM is drawn to the FORWARD RAILING of the SHIP,
          looking up at the VAST WALL of ROCK towering over them in AWE.




          WIDE ON: The VENTURE SLOWS, but its weight is carrying it forward





           NGLE ON: A TERRIFIED JIMMY braces himself for impact.




          ENGLEHORN searches desperately through the thick FOG.




           NGLE ON: JIMMY, a look of TERROR on his FACE.




           RUNCH! The BOW of the SHIP crumples in to the WALL!








           NGEL ON: ANN rushes out of a door, on to the DECK, alarmed at
          the PANIC on the SHIP.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM looks in utter AWE at the WALL.




          CLOSE ON: ENGLEHORN yells at HAYES.


                    Give me some power! Half astern, both!


                    Half astern, both, Captain!




           NGLE ON: JACK looks with horror as a JAGGED ROCK looms out of
          the FOG off the starboard bow.


                    Rocks!




          ANGLE ON: JIMMY spinning around as he sees ROCKS surrounding
          the SHIP.


                             
                    Rocks to starboard ... to port ...
                    rocks everywhere!




          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN lets go of the WHEEL rushing towards the



                    Take the wheel, Hayes!

          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN rushes on to the DECK and looks with HORROR as
          he realises his SHIP is trapped amid a LABYRINTH of ROCKS.




           he VENTURE lolls WITHOUT POWER in the heavy swell.

          The HEAVY THROB of the ENGINES regain strength ... the reverse
          propellers pull the ship away, but still without adequate control.









          ANGLE ON: ANN hurries up the STAIRS ... she clutches the
          RAILING for support and reels off balance, literally FALLING
          into JACK'S ARMS as the side of the VENTURE CRUNCHES against rock.




          The IMPACT sends the VENTURE into a SLOW SPIN. As the SHIP sinks
          in the trough of a WAVE, MORE ROCKS emerge from the WATER around
          it.




          JACK looks down at ANN - he still has hold of her.




          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN staggers into the WHEELHOUSE, slamming the
          TELEGRAPH LEVER forward.


                      Full ahead!

          ENGLEHORN takes the WHEEL from HAYES.




          HAYES runs OUTSIDE


                      Rocks to port, Captain!




          ANGLE ON: The VENTURE rides the SWELL towards CAMERA.



          A SICKENING GROAN OF METAL ... as the VENTURE RUNS AGROUND on
          HIDDEN ROCKS! HAYES looks in HORROR as he comes within inches of
          the rock outcrop.




          ANGLE ON: DENHAM watches as a HUGE STONE FACE - part of the ROCK
          OUTCROP they have grounded on - slides to a halt just off the
          VENTURE'S BOW. Weathered ... eroded away ... carved by the hand of
          some ANCIENT PEOPLE.

           NGLE ON: A breathless JIMMY scuttles backwards as the CROWSNEST
          settles against the ROCK.






          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN shuts the engines down as his ship GRINDS
          sickeningly against the rock ...





           NGLE ON: HAYES, unable to believe his eyes as he STARES up at the


          DENHAM stares at the EERIE SILHOUETTE of an ISLAND, visible
          through the thinning FOG. JAGGED PEAKS rise from a ROCKY
          SHORELINE. CRUMBLING RUINS cling to BARREN CLIFFS.

          ANN steps closer, a LOOK of total DISBELIEF on her FACE.




          CLOSE ON: JETS of WATER are squirting into the ENGINE ROOM,
          through cracks between RIVETED PLATES.

          HAYES supervises STOKERS frantically opening valves on the
          PUMPS. OLD MATTRESSES are being shoved up against the LEAKS.

          ENGLEHORN arrives, looking GRIM.


                    Hayes!


                     he's taken a pounding ...


                    What about the prop?


                    Shaft's not bent, far as we can tell,
                    but she's stuck hard against the rock -

          A LOUD GROAN as the SHIP shifts against the ROCKS.

          At that moment JIMMY comes bursting into the ENGINE ROOM.


                    Captain! You'd better come up quick!




          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN, HAYES and JIMMY emerge onto the DECK as the
          MILKY LIGHT of DAWN washes over the SHIP.

          CLOSE ON: HERB holds the CAMERA as DENHAM cranks the HANDLE.

          POV: A WHALER - a small lifeboat - is being ROWED away from the
          VENTURE towards the SHORE of the ISLAND. DENHAM, JACK and ANN,
          HERB, MIKE, BRUCE and FOUR SAILORS are packed into the tiny
          boat.







                    You want me to bring them back?


                    I don't give a damn about Carl Denham
                    ... I want this ship fixed and ready
                    to float on the next high tide. We're
                    leaving Mr. Hayes.




           IDE ON: The WHALER rows towards the ISLAND passing great STONE
          RUINS jutting out of the WATER. The HUGE WALL rises out of the
          WAVES and disappears INLAND.

           NGLE ON: DENHAM is balanced at the front of the BOAT, filming as
          the SAILORS row ashore ...


                             
                    Can you believe this, Jack? ... Skull
                    Island! We got our picture!

          ANGLE ON: JACK as he STARES up at the RUINS ...

          CLOSE ON: ANN, as if COMPELLED, turns and looks over the side of
          the BOAT, into the SEA ... her breathe catches!

          ANN'S POV: Beneath the WATER the HIDEOUSLY, DISTORTED FACE of     a
          FALLEN STATUE gapes up at her ...

          ANGLE ON: ANN sitting huddled to one side of the BOAT ... drawing
          her RAIN-SLICKER closer around her ... ANN'S FINGERS edge across
          the seat and curl over JACK'S HAND ...

          WIND WHISTLES through the GAPING HOLES in the EDIFICE ... a CREEPY
          MOANING SOUND that mixes with the DEEP BOOM of the CRASHING WAVES




           NGLE ON: The WHALER runs onto a tiny, stony BEACH. SHEER CLIFFS
          rise straight up from the SHORE.

          DENHAM, JACK, ANN, BRUCE, HERB, MIKE, PRESTON and TWO SAILORS
          clamber out.




           IDE ON: DENHAM leads HERB, PRESTON, JACK, ANN, BRUCE, MIKE   and
          the TWO SAILORS up a DARK, VAULTED TUNNEL. They look in silence at
          the primitive signs of civilisation.

          ANGLE ON: ANN looks up the STAIRCASE nervously ... taking in the
          sight of the HUMAN SKULLS lining the walls.









          JIMMY looks up, hollow-eyed ... in his hand is the copy of
          "HEART OF DARKNESS". HAYES stands nearby.

          ANGLE ON: JIMMY closing the BOOK, an ashen expression on his



                    Why does Marlow keep going up the

                    Jimmy. A part, deep inside himself
                    that sounds a warning, but there's
                    another part, that needs to know ...
                    that needs to defeat the thing which
                    makes him afraid.

          CLOSE ON: HAYES pauses, filled with a sudden sense of DREAD.    He
          reluctantly turns, his eyes drawn to the creepy CARVED HEAD
          towering above the SHIP.

                              HAYES v/o
                    "We could not understand, because we
                    were too far ... and could not
                    remember, because we were travelling
                    in the night of First Ages ...

           LOSE ON: DENHAM obsessed ... cranking the handle of his CAMERA.

                              HAYES V/O 
                    ... of those Ages that are gone,
                    leaving hardly a sign and no memories





          DENHAM leads the GROUP across a RICKETY BAMBOO BRIDGE, spanning a
          section of BROKEN PATH. They pass BROKEN TOMBS, burial niches
          containing glimpses of MUMMIES.

          AHEAD ... DAYLIGHT streams in as they near the end of the
          STAIRCASE. They make their way over large stone blocks, caved
          in from above ... QUIET, TENSE.




          THUNDER RUMBLES overhead as DENHAM, JACK, ANN, HERB, BRUCE,
          PRESTON, MIKE and 2 SAILORS clamber out of the RUINED TUNNEL


          DENHAM stays low, and hurries to a VANTAGE POINT. The OTHERS








                    We are accustomed to look upon the
                    shackled form of a conquered monster,
                    but there, there you could look at a
                    thing monstrous and free."

          CRANE UP: to reveal a PLATEAU below them, covered with the RUINS
          of an ANCIENT BURIAL GROUND ... stone MAUSOLEUMS and TOMBS,
          smashed open and destroyed.




          ANGLE ON: JIMMY closes the BOOK.


                             
                    It's not an adventure story - is it,
                    Mr. Hayes.


                             
                    No, Jimmy, it's not.

          HAYES' EYES drift back to the STATUE. JIMMY follows his GAZE.




          ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he leads the group into the village.

          SPREAD among the RUINS is a VILLAGE - a crude shanty town, created
          by a more recent and far less sophisticated culture ... ramshackle
          GRASS and BAMBOO HUTS.

          ANGLE ON: PRESTON looking around, UNNERVED ...


                    It's deserted ...

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM cranking the CAMERA as he rolls film on the


                    Of course it's deserted. Use your
                    eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin!
                    Nobody's lived here for hundreds of
                    years.

          At the moment they hear the sound of the SOBBING of a HUMAN CHILD


          ANGLES ON: ANN, PRESTON, JACK, DENHAM, HERB ... not knowing if
          they heard what they just heard ...

          ROW UPON ROW of sharpened BAMBOO SPIKES line the top of the WALL.

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM ... His eyes suddenly widen in disbelief.





          ANGLE ON: A SMALL CHILD standing on the DUSTY PATH ahead of them.
          She stares up at them, with weird FERAL EYES.

          THE CHILD slowly raises an arm towards the watching GROUP ... in a
          pointing gesture. A suspended moment ... DENHAM steps forward.


                             
                    Mr Denham ... I think we should go
                    back.


                        will handle this.

          DENHAM pulls a NESTLE BAR from his pocket and walks up to the
          CHILD. DENHAM waves the chocolate around.

                              DENHAM 
                    Look chocolate ... you like chocolate?

          The CHILD'S EYES drill into DENHAM. RAIN STARTS FALLING.

                              DENHAM 
                    Good to eat! Take it ... take it!

          The CHILD steps back. DENHAM grabs the CHILD by the wrist and
          attempts to press the chocolate bar into her HAND. The CHILD
          struggles and CRIES OUT!


                    For Godsake, Denham, leave the native
                    alone.


                    She doesn't want the chocolate!

          ANGLE ON: VILLAGERS begin to melt out of the shadows, OLD PEOPLE,
          YOUNG PEOPLE, WOMEN stare HOLLOW-EYED at DENHAM as he wrestles
          with the CHILD.

           he CHILD sinks her TEETH into DENHAM'S WRIST. He yells, releasing
          his grip. The CHILD runs off ... in to the arms of an OLD WOMAN






          The GROUP starts to nervously walk forward, DENHAM gestures
          impatiently.


                     t's alright - it's just a bunch of
                    women and old folks ... they're
                    harmless.

          ANGLE ON: ANN looks STARTLED as MIKE suddenly LURCHES past her.


                    Mike?

          MIKE turns, gasping, staring at her helplessly! And then FALLS
          face forward, a JAGGED SPEAR stuck in his BACK!

          ANN steps back in HORROR and SCREAMS!

          A RUMBLING, BESTIAL ROAR fills the VILLAGE as if in answer to
          ANN'S CRY ... LOUD and CLOSE ... for a brief moment everyone
          freezes ...

           AST ACTION: NATIVE MEN emerge as if from NOWHERE ... before
          anyone can react, they are roughly SHOVED and PULLED into the
          MIDST of the FURIOUS NATIVE MOB.

          In the SHADOWS the agitated WOMEN of the VILLAGE start rocking and
          wailing in unison.

          IMAGES: STRANGE FACES, smeared with MUD ... SCREECHING MOUTHS.
          BRUCE is HELD BACK by SEVERAL NATIVES as he struggles. JACK
          pulls ANN close to him, trying to protect her. ANN is wrenched
          from him ...

          She struggles against her captors ...

          ANGLE ON: A OLD-WOMAN moves through the midst of the VILLAGERS ...
          her gaze fixed on ANN, muttering curses, eyes burning with a dark
          fury ...

          DENHAM is YELLING at the NATIVES ... he is SHOVED to the GROUND.

          The NATIVES SHRIEK. One of the SAILORS is DRAGGED forward, his
          HEAD pushed against a FLAT STONE SLAB, and CLUBBED TO DEATH.

          ANGLE ON: In the midst of the CONFUSION, JACK sees the          OLD
          SHA-WOMAN screaming at ANN. She starts chanting with rising



                             
                    Larri yu sano kor ... Kweh yon
                    kah`weh ad-larr ... tor Kng.

          CLOSE ON: JACK struggles, fists flying - he is clubbed and DROPS
          like a stone.

          ANN SCREAMS ... the BEAST ROARS in the DISTANCE!






          DENHAM punches a NATIVE ... they haul him forward and thrust
          his HEAD onto the BLOOD SPLATTERED STONE ... NATIVE CLUBS rise
          into the air ...

           .. a GUNSHOT!

          The NATIVES hesitate, as if STUNNED ... then SCATTER.

          ENGLEHORN, HAYES and an ARMED GROUP of SAILORS race into the


          ENGLEHORN roughly hauls DENHAM to his feet.


                     Seen enough?





           IDE ON: As EACH WAVE hits the VENTURE, it GROANS and SCRAPES
          against the ROCKS - SHIFTING SLIGHTLY.




           NGLE ON: ENGLEHORN, desperate ... yelling at his CREW, above the



                              
                     Lighten the ship! Anything that's not
                     bolted down goes overboard!

          ANGLES ON: As WAVES crash against the STRANDED SHIP, LUMPY,
          JIMMY, CHOY and the other SAILORS throw TABLES, CHESTS ...
          KITCHEN EQUIPMENT into the SEA.




          DENHAM is swigging from a HIP FLASK. HERB and PRESTON are gathered
          gloomily around a TABLE, while DENHAM strides around the ROOM,
          swigging and talking in a animated fashion. The STORM BATTERS and
          CRASHES outside.


                     We got away. We gotta be grateful for
                     that gentlemen.


                     What about Mike? He didn't get away -
                     he's still there!


                              
                     Mike died doing what he believed in!
                     He didn't die for nothing. And I'll
                     tell you something else - I'm going to
                     finish this film - for Mike.




                    I'm going to NHAM donate the
                              DE finish it and
                    proceeds to his wife and kids -
                    because that man is a hero and he
                    deserves nothing less!


                    Hear! Hear!




          ANN alone in her CABIN, is overwhelmed by a terrible SENSE of


          SUDDENLY! A WAVE crashes against her WINDOW! SHE SPINS AROUND


          As she turns slowly she catches sight of her terrified reflection
          in the MIRROR.




          ANGLE ON: NATIVES are moving towards the VENTURE ...






          A growing sense of UNEASE fills ANN with DREAD.






          ANGLE ON: using LONG BAMBOO POLES, A NATIVE silently VAULTS from
          ROCK to ROCK over the STORMY SEAS ... towards the GROUNDED SHIP




           NGLE ON: A SKULL ISLANDER LANDS on the BACK DECK of the
          VENTURE UNSEEN! He CROUCHES in the shadows ...




          CLOSE ON: JACK sprawled on a BENCH SEAT in the MESS ... a LOUD
          METALLIC CREAK wakes him up. He rolls over, tries to focus ...
          he touches his hand to the back of his HEAD ... when he
          withdraws his hand ... his fingers are covered in BLOOD.

          SUDDENLY LUMPY and a SAILOR pick the TABLE up from under him and
          carry it outside.











          CLOSE ON: ANN, a sense of foreboding...




          ANGLE ON: JACK staggers on to the BACK DECK, clutching a
          railing to steady himself. He suddenly discovers a NATIVE
          NECKLACE on the DECK ...

          ... JACK stares at the NECKLACE, decorated with a MONKEY SKULL,
          a look of HORRIFIED REALIZATION growing. JIMMY is racing past,
          JACK grabs him:


                    Where's Ann?


                    She went to her cabin.




          ANN alone in her CABIN. She looks down and notices her HANDS are


           UDDENLY! Her CABIN door starts to rattle. She swings around in
          FRIGHT, to see cabin's DOOR HANDLE - which is turning ...

          ANGLE ON: ANN'S FACE as her CABIN DOOR opens ...




          ANGLE ON: JACK desperately pushes past CREW in the CROWDED,
          panicked CORRIDOR, trying to get to ANN'S CABIN ...




          WIDE ON: The VENTURE at the MERCY of the RAGING SEAS as it
          moves even closer to the REEF.




          ANGLE ON: JACK loses his footing as the SHIP lurches VIOLENTLY.
          He lands on the floor ...

          CLOSE ON: JACK looks down the length of the CORRIDOR ... the
          DOOR of ANN'S CABIN is swinging open.




           LOSE ON: The SHIP ROLLS as JACK staggers into ANN'S CABIN ...
          SHOCKED to find it EMPTY with clear signs of a STRUGGLE.








          ANGLE ON: HAYES desperately trying to control the WHEEL.




          WIDE ON: The VENTURE floats free!

          A LOUD CHEER goes up from the CREW!




          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN shouts the command ...


                    Wheel amidship ... Full ahead, both
                    engines.




           IDE ON: The VENTURE plows between the JAGGED ROCKS off toward





          JACK bursts into the CABIN. CLOTHES are SCATTERED EVERYWHERE.
          clearly a sign of a struggle.


                    Ann!




           NGLE ON: JACK races down the CORRIDOR finding a DEAD CREW
          MEMBER lying below the STAIRS!




          ANGLE ON: ANN in the NATIVE'S GRIP ... they are being PULLED
          through the STORMY SEAS onto the SHORE, by the other NATIVES
          HAULING on a ROPE. ANN is HALF DROWNED.

          The VENTURE is barely visible moving through the SEA SPRAY.




          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN comes out of the WHEELHOUSE - JACK is on the



                     top! Stop! Turn back, we have to turn
                    back!






          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN turns - he can hear the alarm in JACK's VOICE.

                                 JACK 
                       They've taken Ann!

          CLOSE ON: ENGLEHORN, he glances back at the ISLAND as the VENTURE
          ploughs towards the open sea.

          ANGLE ON: An ORANGE GLOW of FIRELIGHT is VISIBLE, emanating
          from the NATIVE VILLAGE.




           NGLE ON: ANN being DRAGGED through a FRENZY OF FEARFUL Skull
          Island NATIVES. GLIMPSES of WAILING ... COWERING ... CHANTING.

          FLAMES BLAZE along the TOP OF THE WALL.

          CLOSE ON: A withered old WOMAN, EYES RED in some DRUG induced
          TRANCE, speaks in TONGUES. ANN is forced to her knees.

          The OLD WOMAN splashes some foul LIQUID into her face ... younger
          WOMEN tie BRACELETS on her wrists.



          ANGLE ON: COVERS are pulled off lifeboats as the SHIP'S CREW
          gather EQUIPMENT.

          CLOSE ON: HAYES yelling commands:


                       All hands going ashore ...







                       ... report to stations! Jump to it!

          ENGLEHORN LIFTS UP THE WINDOW SEAT ... revealing a ROW of TOMMY
          GUNS hidden there.

          ANGLES ON: GUNS are handed out.




          ANGLE ON: EQUIPMENT and RIFLES are THROWN IN. The ENTIRE SHIP'S
          CREW is MOBILIZING.


                       What the hell are you doing? You want
                       that boat to sink? Stow those rifles
                       midships - come on, hurry it up!






          ANGLE ON: DENHAM surreptitiously supervises HERB and PRESTON as
          they load CAMERA EQUIPMENT on board one of the BOATS ...

          ANGLE ON: JACK loading a BOX of AMMUNITION on to the other BOAT
          ... he looks tensely at the FIRES burning on the ISLAND.

          ANGLE ON: The TWO BOATS are swung out and LOWERED.

                                 HAYES 
                    Lower away!




            he TWO BOATS ROW AWAY from the SHIP, packed with SHIP'S CREW
          ... in one BOAT are DENHAM, PRESTON and HERB - clutching CAMERA


          ANGLE ON: JACK in the OTHER BOAT, looking GRIM and DETERMINED.




          ANGLE ON: the TINY BOATS are tossed in the RAGING SEAS. SAILORS
          try to STEER them towards the SHORE, as they bounce off ROCKS and

          the TOP of the WALL.

          ANGLES ON: ANN'S WRIST'S are TIED outstretched to BAMBOO POSTS.
          She is on the SUMMIT of the WALL, lit by the flickering FLAMES ...
          looking out onto DARK TREE TOPS.

           LAMES DANCE ... DRUMS BEAT in a RITUALISTIC FRENZY.

          ANGLE ON: SKULL ISLANDERS knock away WOODEN PLUGS, releasing the
          FLAMING OIL to pour down rough CHANNELS hewn into the STONE of the
          WALL ... it runs and falls down CHUTES into POOLS carved into the


          WIDE ON: The CLIFF WALLS light up as FLAMES within LARGE CARVED
          CHAMBERS create huge backlit PAGAN FACES.

          FIRELIGHT dances across the nightmarish JUNGLE ... DISTANT TREES
          start to TREMBLE, their canopies swaying as if PUSHED by an UNSEEN


          CLOSE ON: ANN ... looking on with HORROR at the MOVEMENT in the
          JUNGLE below her. She struggles against the ROPES, to no avail.

          CLOSE ON: The OLD WOMAN, eyes rolled up in her head.

           LOSE ON: A NECKLACE is placed over ANN'S head.





          ANGLE ON: A SHAMAN starts BEATING out a RHYTHM on a LOG DRUM ...
          SKULL ISLANDERS fall to their KNEES ... a MOANING WAIL rises ...
          the DRUMMING builds to a FRENZIED CLIMAX.

          WIDE ON: On the OTHER SIDE, the WALL falls away vertically into a
          ROCKY GROTTO, leading into the DENSE TANGLED JUNGLE of SKULL


          SUDDENLY ANN feels herself DRAGGED FORWARD ... the POSTS she is

          digs her heels and tries to PULL AGAINST it, but is unable to stop
          herself being HAULED OFF THE WALL ...

           .. into thin air!

          ANGLE ON: SKULL ISLANDERS lowering the BAMBOO ALTAR STRUCTURE
          DOWN, slowly releasing the flaxen ROPE.

          ANN is dangling from the POSTS by her WRISTS, as the HINGED
          FRAMEWORK swings her out over the CHASM, LOWERING her towards a
          ROCK PROMONTORY on the EDGE of the FOREST.

           NGLE ON: ANN is LOWERED onto the ROCK PROMONTORY, which resembles
          an ALTAR ... ANN struggles to free herself, but she is tied fast
          to the posts, a TINY FIGURE illuminated by enormous GLOWING
          CARVINGS ... the WALL towering up behind her.

          ANGLES ON: ANN squirms ... as the FOREST BELOW HER BROILS and
          SEETHES! TREES are violently SWAYING ... above the crescendo of
          the NATIVE FRENZY, ANGRY BESTIAL ROARS can be heard.

          SKULL ISLANDERS line the TOP of the WALL, their WAILING and
          CHANTING interrupted by a LOUD SPLINTERING SOUND.




          The SHIP'S BOATS pull up at the foot of the great STAIRCASE. JACK
          leaps out of the BOAT and races up the stairs.




          CLOSE ON: ANN lifts her head ... something VERY BIG is moving
          towards HER.

          ANN catches a BRIEF GLIMPSE of a HUGE DARK SHAPE propelling itself
          THROUGH the JUNGLE ... the OILY SMOKE from the FIRES hangs in the
          air, OBSCURING HER VISION ... she can now only hear the CREATURE'S
          MOVEMENTS and BREATH as it draws ever closer.

          ANN cowers back, pulling at her bonds.

          A MASSIVE SHAPE moves through the air ... The ground SHAKES with a
          sudden force of IMPACT!

          ANGLE ON: ANN stands trembling, as the swirling smokey cloud
          slowly DISSIPATES ... a GIANT LEATHERY FOOT is visible.

          CLOSE ON: ANN balanced on a knife-edge of TERROR.







          ANN slowly LOOKS UP, her face filled with DREAD.

          The SKULL ISLANDERS reply in UNISON ... a piercing WAIL, from the
          TOP of the WALL.

          ANN'S strength suddenly DRAINS from her legs, and SLUMPS between
          the POSTS.

          Before her is ... KONG!

          A 25 FOOT TALL MALE GORILLA! KONG stares at ANN for a beat,
          leaning forward on his KNUCKLES ... then prods her with his
          finger.






          FRENZIED MOVEMENT: SAILORS, lead by ENGLEHORN, race into the
          VILLAGE firing WARNING SHOTS in the air ... SKULL ISLANDERS
          SCATTER in TERROR ...




           IDE ON: KONG in front of ANN ... HE RISES to his full height and


          KONG'S HUGE HAND snatches ANN and roughly PULLS her free of her
          bonds.





          CLUTCHING her tightly, KONG carries ANN away from the ALTAR.




          FRENZIED MOVEMENT: SAILORS, lead by ENGLEHORN, race into the
          VILLAGE firing WARNING SHOTS in the air ... SKULL ISLANDERS
          SCATTER in TERROR ...

          ANGLES ON: The SKULL ISLANDERS melt away into the darkness ...
          vanishing as fast as they appeared.

          ... from behind the WALL, the DISTANT CRY of ANN screaming for
          help, following by an EARTH SHUDDERING ROAR.


                               
                      What in God's name was that?


                               
                      Behind the wall!






          ANGLE ON: JACK rushes to the BASE of the WALL and begins to climb


          DENHAM hurries to the massive, heavily fortified gate.

           LOSE ON: DENHAM staring through the LATTICE WORK of sharpened
          bamboo ...

          DENHAM'S POV: A fleeting glimpse of KONG disappearing into the
          depths of the jungle. In his HUGE FIST KONG clutches ANN!




           NGLE ON: JACK has reached the top of the WALL ... he races to the
          EDGE peering over it. Nothing ... only the primitive ALTAR, and
          beyond, DARK JUNGLE dissolving into BLACKNESS.

          JACK'S POV: The EMPTY ROPES binding ANN'S WRISTS swing from the



                               
                      She's gone!




           ACK is hurrying down from the WALL.


                      She's gone!

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM in SHOCK ... his mind racing, fuelled by FEAR.
          Gradually his breathing slows and another part of his brain kicks
          into gear.

          JACK makes brief eye contact with DENHAM, who quickly looks away.

                                JACK 
                      Carl? What is it?
                               
                      You saw something ...



          ANGLE ON: BOXES of AMMUNITION and GUNS have been brought up      from
          the beach. Lids are prised open ... AMMO distributed.

          DENHAM is surrounded by JACK, ENGLEHORN and the SAILORS.


                      You can take Hayes and fifteen others.
                      I'll put a guard on the gate until you
                      return ... The rest of you, stay with
                      the ship.

          JACK grabs his PACK and WALKS away TOWARDS THE GATE, with LUMPY &amp;
          JIMMY following.






                    Not you, Jimmy.


                    Com'on Mr. Hayes, look at `em. None of
                    them knows a which way to point a gun.

          HAYES takes the RIFLE out of JIMMY'S HANDS.


                    Stay here.


                    Miss Darrow needs me!


                    No!

          CLOSE ON: JIMMY, crestfallen.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM by the CAMERA BOXES with HERB and PRESTON.


                             
                    Bring the tripod - and all of the film
                    stock.


                    You wanna go with the six inch lens?


                    The wide angle will do just fine.

          CLOSE ON: PRESTON slings the FILM STOCK BAG over his SHOULDER.

          ANGLE ON: JACK, PRESTON, HAYES, LUMPY, CHOY, BRUCE and 8 SAILORS
          as ENGLEHORN surveys the GROUP. DENHAM and HERB are HAULING CAMERA



                    You got guns, you got food, you got
                    ammo. You got twenty-four hours.


                    Twenty-four hours?


                    This time tomorrow we haul anchor.

          CLOSE ON: JACK ... as he slings his GUN on his shoulder, turns
          and HEADS through the GATE.




          WIDE ON: The VOLCANIC ROCKS form a JAGGED, TORTURED LANDSCAPE of
          DEEP CREVASSES and TOWERING CLIFFS. The vegetation is THICK, the
          JUNGLE DARK. ANCIENT GNARLED TREES twist out of the ground, thick
          LICHEN and long MOSSES hang from branches and TANGLED VINES. STEAM
          RISES from festering SWAMPS ...







          HAYES is LEADING DENHAM, JACK, PRESTON, LUMPY, CHOY, BRUCE and
          EIGHT SAILORS. HERB is limping along with the heavy CAMERA on his
          shoulder.

          The atmosphere is TENSE ... unseen creatures scurry in the
          darkness, fleeing from the approaching humans.

          HAYES puts his hands up ... the GROUP stops ... a STRANGE, LOW
          MOAN echoes from the SURROUNDING JUNGLE ... The MEN stare into the
          darkness ... watchful, on edge ...




          CLOSE ON: ANN in KONG'S HAND, being tossed around like a rag doll
          as KONG RUNS through the FOREST.

           NGLE ON: KONG propels himself through the JUNGLE with EASE,
          barely disturbing the forest, moving with GRACE along a well used
          route.

           LOSE ON: ANN held fast in his GRIP. She is FLUNG wildly around as
          KONG BOUNDS across CHASMS, LEAPING over rivers.

          ANN'S FEVERED POV: The JUNGLE SPINNING and BLURRING by. She tries
          to brace herself against KONG'S FINGERS, but the rigors of the
          journey knock her sideways like a RAG DOLL.

          WIDE ON: SHAFTS of MOONLIGHT play on the faces of grotesque
          STATUES set into a MOSSY CLIFF.

          ANGLE ON: ANN clutched tightly in KONG'S HAND. She is rigid with
          FEAR. KONG squats down ... he LOOKS CLOSELY at ANN.

          CLOSE ON: KONG ... we see him clearly for the first time. A very
          old, brutish BULL GORILLA. Years of survival have left SCARS on
          his face. One EYE LID is mangled and his JAW is CROOKED ...
          leaving a huge yellowed INCISOR TOOTH jutting up.

          KONG stares at ANN ... she dare not move; only her RAPID BREATHING
          belies her INNER TERROR.

          ANGLE ON: ANN is suddenly swung UPSIDE DOWN and SHAKEN ... the
          ceremonial NECKLACE falls from ANN'S NECK.

          CLOSE ON: ANN'S HORRIFIED FACE ... she sees HUMAN REMAINS amongst
          the NECKLACES! Bones ... skulls! A WHIMPERING SOUND escapes from
          the back of her throat.

          SWIRLING UPSIDE DOWN POV: The NECKLACE lands on the ground - amid
          DOZENS of OTHER NECKLACES littering the clearing.

          ANGLE ON: ANN is lifted UPWARDS ... KONG'S LIPS curl in a low,
          slow SNARL.

          ANN looks at KONG, aghast, and in this moment her heightened sense
          of FEAR gives way to something more fundamental: SELF






          KONG'S FINGERS start to OPEN - ANN seizes her chance! She suddenly
          PROPELS herself off his HAND! ANN DROPS 12 feet and lands heavily
          at KONG'S FEET. She rolls amongst grinning HUMAN SKULLS and LEG
          BONES ... staggers to her feet and RUNS!

          KONG rises up with a ROAR, but ANN is already disappearing into
          the JUNGLE!




            NGLES ON: ANN desperately powering through the DENSE UNDERGROWTH.
          She throws herself over huge FALLEN LOGS, through TANGLED VINES.

          She GLANCES BACK ...

           .. TREES are FALLING, KONG is smashing through the undergrowth
          after her!

          ANGLE ON: With surprising AGILITY and GRACE, KONG sweeps down from
          above and SCOOPS ANN off the ROCK. She barely has time to CRY OUT
          before being CARRIED AWAY, as KONG disappears into the DEPTHS of
          the ISLAND.




          CLOSE ON: JACK ... hearing ANN'S DISTANT SCREAMS!


                    Ann!

          ANGLE ON: JACK starts RUNNING towards the SOUND. DENHAM and the
          OTHERS follow ... JACK is barging through THICK TANGLED
          VEGETATION, which is growing between huge moss covered FALLEN


          KONG'S ENRAGED ROAR echos through the JUNGLE.

                              JACK 
                             
                    Ann!




          ANGLE ON: The GROUP pause at the sound of ANN'S TERRIFIED SCREAM.

          CLOSE ON: JACK'S ashen face.




           ONG LEAPS ACROSS CHASMS as he CARRIES ANN through the JUNGLE.




          ANGLE ON: JACK picks up ANN'S NECKLACE ... a LOCK of BLONDE    HAIR
          still tangled within it's STRANDS ...





          WIDE ON: DAWN LIGHT brightens the SKY as the GROUP survey the

                    ANN! Ann!

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM casts an eye over the DEBRIS STREWN GROUND ...
          his gaze rising to a HUGE GASH in the FOREST ...

          DENHAM POV: TREES have been RIPPED from the earth where KONG    has
          SMASHED a path through the JUNGLE ...

          ANGLE ON: HAYES notices a SAILOR with a WOOLLEN HAT pulled   down
          over his head ... the SAILOR has turned away from the GRISLY
          REMAINS. HAYES bats the hat off the SAILOR'S HEAD ... it's JIMMY.


                    Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes. Pretend
                    you didn't see me.


                     esus, Jimmy!

          HAYES snatches the GUN off him ...


                              defiant)
                    Hey! I need that!

                    You were younger than me when they
                    gave you one!


                    I was in the army. I was trained - I
                    had a drill sergeant!

          CLOSE ON: JIMMY looks at HAYES.


                              quietly)
                    I just wanna help bring her back.

          HAYES's expression softens. He hands the gun back to JIMMY.


                    Don't make me regret it.








          ANGLE ON: The GROUP'S NERVES are FRAYED ... as they continue
          slogging through the difficult TERRAIN. HUGE INSECTS fly around
          them, AND THE GROUP try in vain to SWAT them away.

          ANGLE ON: LUMPY shooting WILDLY at a HUGE BUG ...


                              growling)
                    Conserve your ammunition!

          LUMPY GLARES at HAYES ... and SHOOTS one last time at a HUGE BUG





          ANGLE ON: SLIDING FEET ... down a VINE strewn slope.

           ULL BACK to reveal ... the GROUP have emerged from the JUNGLE
          into a NARROW VALLEY, deep in the heart of SKULL ISLAND ... The
          VALLEY is less than 75 feet wide, flanked by sheer CLIFFS.

          JACK looks up and down the VALLEY ... he wipes his brow ..    the
          SUN is high, it is hot out of the SHADE.

          ANGLE ON: LUMPY stumbling forward with a hacking SMOKER'S COUGH.


                    I'm knackered! I've gotta have a
                    breather.

          LUMPY flops down on the ground, and grabs a cigarette from behind
          his ear and lights up.

          JACK watches as OTHER SAILORS follow suit.


                    Hey fellas - we don't have time for
                    this. We've lost too much ground
                    already! Come on, - get up!


                             
                    They're not about to quit on you. Cut
                    them some slack.

          JACK stares at HAYES and then sighs, resigned.

          HAYES calls to the MEN ...

                              HAYES

                    Everybody stay in sight!

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM grabs the CAMERA from HERB. Nearby PRESTON sets
          up the TRIPOD.





                             
                    Over here. I wanna get a wide shot of
                    the valley.

           NGLE ON: DENHAM as he arrives at the top of the SLOPE, he       turns
          at the sound of a STRANGE NOISE ...

          PUSH IN: ON DENHAM ... a look of AMAZEMENT dawning on his FACE.

          CLOSE ON: JACK kneels down and stares at an unmistakable     indent
          in the sand: a GIANT FOOTPRINT!


                    Bloody Nora!

          JACK looks up to see SAILORS gathering around.


                    Is that what took Miss Darrow?


                             
                    There's only one creature capable of

                              LUMPY 
                    The abominable snowman!

          A ripple of FEAR spreads throughout the CROWD.

          The RATTLED SAILORS mutter agreement. There is random chatter of
          turning back.

          HAYES kneels down beside JACK ...


                             
                    It's gotta be - what? Twenty - twenty-

                    What?!

          ANGLE ON: a HERD of TWELVE BRONTOSAURS are slowly moving through a
          WIDE CLEARING ahead.


                    You're the star of this picture! Get
                    into character and head towards the
                    animals.

          ANGLE ON: BRUCE nervously SHUFFLES forward ...


                    What the hell kind of place is this?
                              
                    Are you sure about this, Denham???
                    Don't we have a stand-in for this type
                    of thing?


                      need you in the shot, or people will
                    say they're fake.


                    Nobody's gonna think these are fake!

          SUDDEN flash of MOVEMENT! CARNOTAURS are circling the HERD.

          ANGLE ON: the BRONTOSAUR HERD looking EDGY and RESTLESS!


                     ou're making them nervous! No sudden
                    movement.


                    I'm not moving.

          A LOW RUMBLING SOUND can now be heard ... the GROUND starts to


          PUSH IN: on BRUCE as he realizes what is about to HAPPEN!

                              BRUCE 
                             
                    Mother of God ...

          ANGLE ON: BRUCE suddenly turns and runs!

          ANGLE ON: HERB is starting to get NERVOUS as DENHAM determinedly
          continues filming ...



          WIDE ON: A sudden FALL of ROCKS ... Jack looks up!

          ANGLE ON: The MEN look NERVOUS as the GROUND starts to TREMBLE
          beneath their feet!

          JACK turns and sees: BRUCE running down the hill ...


                    What is it?! Where's Carl?

          BRUCE slows down, attempting to appear CALM.


                    He's - he's ... um ... well, he's up
                    there ... filming.



          BRUCE bolts like a STARTLED RABBIT!

          SEVERAL nervous SAILORS jump up and start running.

          ANGLE ON: JACK cautiously moves uphill towards the source of the


           NGLE ON: DENHAM and HERB appear on the brow of the HILL. They are
          running flat out towards JACK!

          Seconds later a HERD of BRONTOSAURUS stampede down the hill after
          DENHAM and HERB!


                    Run Jack!


                    Holy Christ!


                             
                    Go Jimmy - Run!

          EVERYONE TURNS and FLEES!

          ANGLE ON: JACK running ... he looks back and sees DENHAM trip and
          fall!

          The STAMPEDING DINOSAURS storm towards DENHAM down the NARROW


          CLOSE ON: DENHAM is frozen to the spot, staring at the CAMERA,
          which is lying directly in the rampaging DINOSAUR'S PATH.

          JACK turns back ... he attempts to drag DENHAM to his FEET, as
          DENHAM struggles to grab hold of the CAMERA and TRIPOD.


                    Leave it!!!


                    No!!!





          DENHAM and JACK scramble to their feet and start to RUN!   DENHAM
          cradles the CAMERA and TRIPOD in his ARMS, as the   BRONTO PACK
          bears down on them from behind!

          Spectacular TRACKING SHOT: ... The PACK of 15 CARNOTAURS are
          CLOSING IN on the BRONTOSAURUS HERD! A CARNOTAUR leaps onto the
          back of a FLEEING BRONTOSAUR, causing it to falter and slide
          against the cliff. TWO MORE CARNOTAURS leap onto the ailing
          BRONTOSAUR as the rest of the pack stream past.

          DENHAM, JACK and the OTHERS are running as fast as they can ...
          JACK glances over his shoulder - the WALL of THUNDERING BRONTOSAUR
          LEGS are about to ENGULF THEM!

           NGLE ON: JACK and DENHAM suddenly find themselves in a SEA of
          HUGE LEGS - like wildly pounding Redwood tree trunks! The
          CARNOTAURS are snapping and snarling at the LEGS ... they see the
          MEN! Their only hope of survival is to stay WITHIN THE STAMPEDE,
          out of reach of the MEATEATERS!

          QUICK IMAGES: THE GROUP in the SEA of LEGS ... a SAILOR trips and
          is CRUSHED UNDERFOOT. A COUPLE OF SAILORS jump clear of the
          BRONTOSAURS - only to be set on by the CARNOTAURS. JACK ... DENHAM
          ... SAILORS ... everyone is running madly, dodging BRONTOSAURS,
          CARNOTAURS and trying not to fall!

          A CARNOTAUR focuses on JACK ... it skillfully weaves IN BETWEEN
          and UNDER the BRONTOSAURS and emerges right behind JACK, it's
          SNAPPING JAWS inches away from his head!

           ACK suddenly SIDE-STEPS, and SHOULDER-BARGES the CARNOTAUR
          SIDEWAYS - under a BRONTOSAUR'S LEGS. The CARNOTAUR is instantly
          trampled!

          BRUCE is managing to stay ahead of the stampede - possibly RUNNING
          FASTER than any human before him! A CARNOTAUR races out in front
          of the stampede and bears down on BRUCE with incredible speed!
          BRUCE desperately waves a TOMMY GUN at the CARNOTAUR ... TOWARDS


          JACK sees it coming ...


                             
                    No!!!!

          BRUCE FIRES, missing the CARNOTAUR ...

          ... but he hits the LEAD BRONTOSAUR, following behind, in the
          chest. The BRONTOSAUR COLLAPSES AT TOP SPEED! It CARTWHEELS OVER,
          it's huge NECK and TAIL thrashing out. The OTHER BRONTOSAURS
          PLOUGH INTO IT, tripping and rolling!

          JACK and the SAILORS suddenly find themselves in the middle of an
          amazing FLESHY FREIGHT TRAIN PILE-UP! SAILORS are crushed as
          BRONTOSAURS come down on top of them! A CARNOTAUR is squashed when
          TWO BRONTOSAURS slam together.

          JACK rolls against a rock as MOUNTAINS of BRONTOSAUR TUMBLE all
          around him.






          DENHAM throws himself onto the ground, shielding the CAMERA.

            n the space of seconds, the MIGHTY HERD OF BEHEMOTHS is reduced
          to a VAST PILE of DEAD or WOUNDED ANIMALS ... The CARNOTAURS
          immediately go to work, leaping onto BRONTOSAURS, ripping into
          fleshy stomachs.

           ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he
          staggers out of the DINOSAUR PILE-UP ... he turns back at the
          SOUND OF LOUD HISSING - a CARNOTAURUS is climbing over a DEAD
          BRONTOSAUR, it's gleaming eyes intent on JACK. The CARNOTAURUS
          leaps ...

          BAM! BAM! BAM! The CARNOTAURUS is riddled with BULLETS and falls
          DEAD at JACK'S FEET!

          HAYES hurries towards JACK, clutching his TOMMY GUN!


                              
                    Go! Go!

          HAYES sends the rest of the MEN up a steep ROCKY SLOPE ... they
          SLIP and SLIDE on the SLIMY MOSS-COVERED ROCKS.

          JACK doesn't move. He looks around in mounting panic.


                             
                    Carl!? Carl?! Get up!

          DENHAM limps out of the PILE-UP, bloodied and covered in DUST -
          the CAMERA in his arms.

          HAYES blasts at another CARNOTAURUS - it TOPPLES BACKWARDS.


                    Run!




          The GROUP are desperately scrambling up the STEEP ROCKY SLOPE -
          slipping and sliding on the WET MOSS ... FOUR SURVIVING CARNOTAURS
          follow in pursuit ... the MEN start sliding backwards in their
          panic. The CARNOTAURS are sliding too, but their powerful legs are
          working furiously, propelling them closer and closer to the
          flailing SAILORS!

          A SAILOR loses his footing completely ... he rolls past TWO
          CARNOTAURS before being grabbed by the JAWS of the THIRD.

          The MEN grab hold of WEEDS, ROCKS ... ANYTHING, to get away from
          the DINOSAURS. They are crawling towards a network of NARROW
          FISSURES between HUGE ROCKS ... which the CARNOTAURS cannot
          squeeze through.

          ANGLE ON: HERB is scrabbling up as best as he can with his bad leg
          ... DENHAM moves towards him, reaching desperately ...





                    Herb! Come on!


                             
                    Mr Denham ... ! Take the tripod.


                    Come on Herb - I'm pulling you up.
                    Come on, hold on to your end.


                             
                    You gotta go!!


                    I'm not going anywhere without you!


                    You gotta leave me!

          HERB is straining to hold the TRIPOD when his GAMMY LEG gives way
          ... he SLIPS and ROLLS into the path of an oncoming CARNOTAUR!

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM reacting in SHOCK as HERB is KILLED by the
          frenzying CARNOTAURS.




          ANGLE ON: KONG drops ANN onto the ground. She LANDS in a LIFELESS
          heap.

          KONG has dropped ANN in a small RUINED COURTYARD, it's WALLS are
          cracked and split by encroaching JUNGLE CREEPERS.

           IDE ON: KONG circles around ANN who lies MOTIONLESS on the
          GROUND. He PRODS her ROUGHLY with a FINGER ... no response.   KONG
          GROWLS ... PRODS AGAIN ... ANN lies STILL.

           LOSE ON: ANN ... she slowly OPENS HER EYES! ANN looks warily
          towards KONG.




           ACK, DENHAM, HAYES, BRUCE, JIMMY, LUMPY, CHOY and PRESTON clamber
          down a JAGGED ROCK face into lush sub-tropical VEGETATION. They
          are followed by a few surviving SAILORS - a bedraggled GROUP ...
          CUT, BRUISED, COVERED in DUST, SOAKED in SWEAT. Most of the GUNS
          are lost.

           AILORS slump to the ground, EXHAUSTED.

          They are on a NARROW CLEARING at the edge of a MISTY SWAMP. SHEER
          CLIFFS rise out of the SWAMP on both sides of the SHORE.


                    Jimmy, do a head count. I wanna know
                    how many injured and how bad -




                             
                    Injured? Four of us are dead!

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaches with a trembling hand for his HIP FLASK.
          He takes a big SWIG ... and stands staring out over the SWAMP.
          PRESTON sits on A TREE STUMP nearby.


                    It's not your fault. What happened to
                    Herb - it's no ones fault.


                             
                    You're absolutely right, Preston ...
                    And I'll tell you something else.
                    Herbert didn't die for nothing. He
                    died for what he believed in and I'm
                    gonna honour that.

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaching for that moment of self justification.

                               DENHAM 
                    He died believing there is still some
                    mystery left in this world - and we
                    can all have a piece of it - for the
                    price of an admission ticket!
                              
                    Goddammit Preston we're gonna finish
                    this film for Herb. We'll finish it,
                    and donate the proceeds to his wife
                    and kids.

          CLOSE ON: PRESTON, he has heard this all before.

          WIDE ON: BRUCE stands amongst the SEATED SAILORS.


                             
                    We gotta get back to the ship.
                    Englehorn sails in nine hours.


                    So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.


                    Hey, did you hear me? We're gonna be
                    stranded here!

          BRUCE becomes aware of JACK staring at him COLDLY. BRUCE self
          consciously clears his THROAT.

                              BRUCE 
                    Miss Darrow was a great gal - no
                    question. She was a wonderful person.
                    It's a terrible loss. We're all gonna
                    miss her.






                    I always knew you were nothing like
                    the tough guy you play on screen - I
                    just never figured you for a coward.


                    Hey, pal, wake up. Heroes don't look
                    like me - not in the real world. In
                    the real world they've got bad teeth,
                    a bald spot and a beer gut ... be
                    seeing ya.

          BRUCE walks off. HAYES turns to the rest of the GROUP.


                    Anyone else?

          A couple of SAILORS shuffle forward towards BRUCE.




          WIDE ON: KONG SITS on the EDGE of a RUIN, surveying the JUNGLE.

          He SITS with his BACK to ANN, in the crumbling remains of an
          enclosed ENTRY AREA ... which also provides the only way out.

           ith a splintering rip, KONG pulls off one of the DINOSAUR'S LEGS
          and starts EATING it.

          ANGLE ON: ANN, having feigned unconsciousness, she now cautiously
          searches for a way to escape.

           LOSE ON: ANN LIFTING HER HEAD, risking a quick look around. The
          WALLS are TOO STEEP to attempt an escape ...

          ... but there is a NARROW STAIRWAY across the COURTYARD, leading
          down into the JUNGLE.

          INCH by INCH ANN starts to EDGE FORWARD, CRAWLING on her STOMACH
          towards the STAIRS. KONG is CHEWING NOISILY ... he SHIFTS HIS
          WEIGHT, half turning ... ANN FREEZES.

           ONG GLANCES at ANN, who has resumed her LIFELESS POSE. KONG
          doesn't appear to notice she's moved several feet. He continues


          ANN again starts to EDGE FORWARD ... she is STARTLED when some
          CREEPY INSECTS swarm out of a CRACK in the FLAGSTONES, inches from
          her FACE!

          With only a few feet left to go, ANN quietly rises and scurries
          towards the STAIRWAY. She clambers into the NARROW PASSAGE -
          finally out of KONG'S SIGHT! Glancing back over her shoulder, ANN
          hurries down the STAIRWAY towards FREEDOM!







          ANN pauses at the BOTTOM of the STAIRS, listening for sounds of
          KONG. All is QUIET ... she glances back up the stairs ... no sign
          of him there ...

          ... gathering all her strength ANN emerges from the PASSAGE and
          makes a bold run across the CLEARING towards the cover of the


          THUD! KONG'S FIST SLAMS DOWN in FRONT of ANN!

          She GASPS and tries to change direction ... THUD! Another FIST
          blocks her way. KONG GROWLS ANGRILY!

          ANN swings around and FACES KONG ... he SNARLS at HER, FURIOUS and


           NGLE ON: ANN suddenly ducks under KONG'S ARM and makes a last
          ditch attempt to escape! She is half way across the clearing when
          she TRIPS and FALLS!

           NGLE ON: KONG bounds over to ANN, SLAPPING his HANDS on the
          GROUND in a frenzy of excitement - he utters a GUTTERAL SQUEAL.

          CLOSE ON: ANN, flat on the ground, eyes shut, lying still.

          ANGLE ON: KONG .. circling around ANN, SUSPICIOUS. He PRODS her a
          couple of times ...no response. KONG moves on ... ANN'S EYES flick
          OPEN! At that moment KONG doubles back - CATCHING her out!

          ... ANN SPRINGS UP, looks at KONG for a desperate moment, wonders
          if she should run, decides she'll never make it ... and takes
          another PRATFALL!!

          KONG cocks his HEAD! He GRIMACES, baring his teeth and CIRCLES
          her.

          ANN repeats the COMIC FALL! KONG SLAPS his HANDS on the GROUND,
          SHAKES his HEAD and GROWLS.

          ANN starts to draw upon her VAUDEVILLE ROUTINE, swaying drunkenly
          and falling, then bouncing back up ... working her timing around
          KONG'S reactions - he grows increasingly ENGAGED.

           NGLE ON: ANN BOUNCES UP ... PANTING ... BEADS of SWEAT trickle
          down her face. Her EYES dart between the JUNGLE and KONG, she's
          looking for her chance ...

          ... but KONG is a DEMANDING audience. He wants more ... he wants
          ANN to fall down again.

          KONG PRODS ANN ROUGHLY, knocking her OFF HER FEET. She FALLS to
          the GROUND ... WINDED.

          KONG slaps his hands on the GROUND, and lets out another EXCITED
          GROWL. He thumps the GROUND with his FISTS, and SHAKES his HEAD,
          delighted with the GAME.





          ANN tries to get up - KONG pushes her over again! This time she
          stays on the GROUND, breathing HEAVILY.

           HUMP! THUMP! THUMP! KONG wants more! He tries to PROD ANN into
          getting up and is STARTLED when she HITS his FINGER AWAY!


                             
                    No! I said no!

          KONG cocks his HEAD ... he THUMPS his FISTS on the GROUND.



                               ANN 
                              
                    That's all there is ... there isn't
                    any more.

          KONG RISES TO HIS FEET, and BEATS his CHEST, towering over ANN.

          His HUGE FIST rises into the air and comes SLAMMING DOWN straight


          CLOSE ON: ANN shuts her eyes ... KONG'S FIST THUDS into the ground
          inches away from her.

          THUD! Another FIST SLAMS into the GROUND!

          ANGLE ON: KONG ROARS and beats his chest in a dramatic display of
          ANGER and FRUSTRATION. He rips a TREE from the ground as his ANGER
          spirals into violent MADNESS.

            LOSE ON: ANN as the GROUND SHAKES with the fury of his RAGE. For
          a brief moment KONG and ANN lock in EYE CONTACT!

           LOSE ON: KONG stares at the small figure in his hand who is
          waiting for DEATH to come.

          In this moment an UNFAMILIAR feeling wells inside him ... a half
          formed emotion he hasn't experienced much in his long life: he
          feels a connection to this tiny creature.

          The SPARK of RAGE goes out in KONG'S EYES ...

          KONG stares at ANN as a confusion of feelings wash over him.

           ONG pulls back from ANN ... overcome by sudden UNCERTAINTY. He
          knows only that she has somehow disarmed him ... and this has in
          turn, DIMINISHED his power.

          KONG starts to BACK AWAY from ANN - slowly at first, until DOUBT
          and FEAR compel him to move faster. Suddenly he turns away.

          ANN watches as KONG lopes off. He pulls himself up and over a
          RUINED WALL and DISAPPEARS from SIGHT.

          ANGLE ON: ANN, rising to her feet, finally free of her captor.








           NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... pushing THROUGH
          thorns, TANGLED in VINES ... she is EXHAUSTED, THIRSTY.




           IDE ANGLE: DENHAM, JACK, HAYES, LUMPY, JIMMY, PRESTON and the
          remaining CREW have arrived at a DARK, VINE ENTANGLED CHASM ...
          spanning the narrow, but deadly RAVINE is a SINGLE FALLEN TREE.

          WEAK SUNLIGHT filters through the DARK CANOPY above casting a
          SICKLY GREEN HUE over the place.

           IDE ON: HAYES, followed by JIMMY, leads the GROUP across the
          SLIMY, MOSS covered LOG ... the going is treacherous.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM struggling with the CAMERA ... JACK follows HAYES
          ... LUMPY helps CHOY. They put one foot in front of the other,
          trying not to let the DROP unnerve them.

          ANGLE ON: HAYES suddenly stops ... tensely scanning the DARK RUINS
          on the other side of the CHASM ...

          CREEPY POV: ... something is watching the MEN on the LOG.


                             
                    What is it?

          HAYES motions for JIMMY to be quiet. He stares intently into    the
          DARKNESS of the FOREBODING RUINS.

                              JIMMY 
                             
                    Mr. Hayes ...?

          HAYES turns and looks at JIMMY.


                    If anything happens, I want you to
                    run! Understand?


                    I'm not a coward - I ain't gonna run.


                             
                    It's not about being brave, Jimmy.

          CLOSE ON: JIMMY looking at HAYES uneasily, as he continues across
          the LOG.




           NGLE ON: HAYES is the first to step off the LOG, to the safety of
          the FAR BANK.





          Ahead, some RUINS have collapsed, creating a LONG DARK TUNNEL.

          CLOSE ON: HAYES ... peers into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL.

          ANGLE ON: A PAIR of GLEAMING EYES, reflecting LIGHT ... rushing
          towards HAYES.


                     o back! Back across the log!

          The GROUP on the LOG FREEZE, start to BACK AWAY, slipping and
          sliding on the WET MOSS.


                    I ain't gonna run.


                    Get Jimmy out of here.

          ANGLE ON: HAYES... SHOOTS into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL.

          KONG rampages out of the TUNNEL MOUTH! He SNATCHES HAYES with one
          SWEEP of his HAND.

          CLOSE ON: HAYES in KONG's HAND ...

           IMMY yells! KONG's GAZE turns toward the MEN on the LOG!


                    No! Let him go!
                             
                    Kill him! Kill him!


                             
                    Look at me! Look at me!


                             
                    Bring him down! Mr Hayes!

          SLOWLY HAYES begins to lift his PISTOL up ... KONG's GAZE locks
          back on HAYES ...


                              deadly calm)
                    You've gotta run, Jimmy.


                    No! I ain't gonna run.


                    Do as I say.
                              

                      o with Jack ... All of you.

          KONG stares at HAYES a BEAT ... HAYES suddenly raises his PISTOL
          at KONG to shoot!




                              HAYES 
                    Run!

          ANGLE ON: KONG HURLS HAYES at the SAILORS ... he flies over their
          heads like RAG-DOLL and smashes against the FAR WALL of the RAVINE
          with a sickening CRUNCH.


                    No!

          JIMMY runs at KONG, blinded by tears of GRIEF and RAGE ... JACK
          KNOCKS him down and SHOOTS at KONG.


                             
                    Shoot him!

          WILD SHOOTING from the SAILORS, as they try to maintain BALANCE on
          the LOG.

          KONG ROARS ... DESPERATE SAILORS try to back across the RAVINE.

          KONG runs towards the LOG ... KONG'S FIST smashes at the LOG,
          knocking the men off balance. A SAILOR plummets off into the CHASM
          below.




           NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... hearing the sound of
          gun fire.


                    Hey! Here! Over here!

          She runs up the bank towards the noise.




           IDE ON: KONG has LIFTED the END of the LOG!

          JACK, DENHAM, LUMPY, CHOY, JIMMY, PRESTON and THREE SAILORS hold
          on for dear life ... as KONG vigorously TWISTS and SHAKES the LOG,
          bucking the MEN into the air.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM skates on the MOSS and his CAMERA slides away,
          becoming WEDGED in the fork of a STUMP.

           LL AROUND panicked SAILORS are SHOOTING WILDLY, but fear and lack
          of balance throws their AIM OFF.

           WO SAILORS FALL ... CHOY scrambles for something to grab.


                    Lumpy! Help me!

          LUMPY desperately tries to reach CHOY'S hand ... but CHOY slips
          away into the ABYSS.





          KONG ROARS with FRUSTRATION, and TOSSES the ENTIRE LOG into the


          QUICK IMAGE: DENHAM, PRESTON, JACK, JIMMY and LUMPY gripping the
          LOG as it FALLS!

          QUICK IMAGE: PRESTON thrown off the LOG halfway down ... he
          manages to GRAB onto a ROCKY SHELF.

          ANGLE ON: PRESTON is nearest to the FAR BANK ... he LEAPS, and
          MANAGES to catch hold of some hanging VINES, hauling himself up to
          safety.

          ANGLE ON: The LOG plummets into a web of VINES, which arrest its
          FALL and sends it FLIPPING end on end, throwing the MEN CLEAR into
          mid-air... DENHAM, JACK and LUMPY land in SOFT MUD which cushions
          the impact of the LANDING.




          ANN suddenly spins around ... the DISTANT SOUND of approaching
          FOOTSTEPS through the dense JUNGLE. A flicker of hope in ANN'S
          eyes! She starts hurrying towards the FOOTSTEPS!

          CLOSE ON: ANN sees a distant PLUME of SMOKE - over FOUR MILES AWAY
          ... she hesitates.

          She SLOWLY turns towards the SOUND of the FOOTSTEPS, which are now
          VERY CLOSE. Suddenly a LARGE 8 foot tall CARNIVOROUS DINOSAUR is
          in the GLADE before her!

           NGLE ON: ANN as she quietly backtracks. The CARNIVORE pauses, as
          if SENSING something. It's NOSTRILS twitch. She ducks behind a


           NGLE ON: ANN PEERING around from behind the TREE ...

          ... there is another CARNIVORE BEHIND HER! It snares at her ...
          and pounces!

          ANN leaps away ... she barely has time to start running before the


          ANGLE ON: ANN races past the first CARNIVORE ... the creature
          turns it's head ... and soon BOTH DINOSAURS are pursuing ANN.




           NGLE ON: ANN desperately heads towards the TANGLED ROOT SYSTEM of
          a HUGE TREE. She throws herself forward, as the CARNIVORE'S JAWS
          snap above her head.

           NGLE ON: ANN ROLLS and SCRAMBLES into a HOLLOW under the ROTTEN


          ANGLE ON: The CARNIVORE CLAW at the TREE, trying to get at ANN.





          ANN is lying beneath the ROOTS ... all she can see are LEGS and
          SLAVERING SNOUTS! The DINOSAUR RAM'S it's nose into the NARROW


          SUDDENLY ... ANN sees the LEGS of one of her pursuers LIFT off the
          GROUND - it's taloned feet thrashing in mid-air.

           he SECOND CARNIVORE turns and FLEES into the JUNGLE, as ANN is
          forced to watch the twitching legs SHUDDER and FLAIL.

          The SOUND of BONE CRUNCHING ... CRACK! The CARNIVORE'S LEGS SPASM
          and go limp.

          ANN is completely still, she dare not breathe ... whatever killed
          the CARNIVORE is now inches from her hiding PLACE.

          CLOSE ON: ANN'S FACE ... as she sees something CRAWLING above her.

          CLOSE ON: A DARK HOLE, beneath the tree ... Long FEELERS probe
          along the ROOF of the hole as a HUGE CENTIPEDE CRAWLS towards her.

          ANN doesn't move as it inches towards her face. Suddenly she feels
          another crawling up over her shoulder.

          ANN FREAKS! She desperately scrambles away from the CENTIPEDES ...
          rolls out on the OTHER SIDE of the TREE and stands to RUN...

          ... TOWERING above her, with the DEAD CARNIVORE hanging limply
          from it's HUGE JAWS, is a TYRANNOSAURUS REX!

          ANN starts RUNNING! The TYRANNOSAUR crashes after her with the
          DEAD CARNIVORE still in it's MOUTH... as SHE races through the
          JUNGLE, dodging TREES, leaping over FALLEN LOGS, smashing through
          BUSHES, the TYRANNOSAUR POUNDING ever closer in pursuit. ANN can
          feel its hot sour BREATH blowing on the back of her neck! The HUGE
          JAWS of the HUGE BEAST open INCHES from ANN'S HEAD!




           NGLE ON: ANN slips down a MUDDY BANK, rolls over a LOG, and
          CRASHES NOISILY through a THICKET of PALMS ...




          ANGLE ON: ANN'S LUNGS are bursting, but the TYRANNOSAUR is   GAINING
          on her ... she manages to scramble onto a FALLEN TREE that   juts
          out over a small CLIFF. ANN clings onto the MOSSY LOG, and   crawls
          towards the END ... the TYRANNOSAUR cannot possibly follow   her.

          She falls amongst the roots, lying as flat as possible, praying
          the TYRANNOSAUR doesn't see her. It seems to work and IT walks
          off. ANN HESITANTLY SITS up, thinking that she is at last free,
          only to turn and discover another is behind her!

          With an almost delicate movement, the TYRANNOSAUR nudges the LOG
          with it's head ... causing it to lurch dramatically! The
          TYRANNOSAUR pushes HARDER, sending ANN over the SIDE ...





          she just manages to grab hold of a BRANCH as she FALLS. ANN hangs
          on desperately ...



          ANN is HELPLESS ... The TYRANNOSAUR positions it's HEAD for the
          FINAL LUNGE - gaping JAWS OPEN impossibly WIDE ...



          KONG meets the TYRANNOSAUR HEAD-ON at FULL SPEED! He swings, with
          his FOOT smashing the TYRANNOSAUR against the FALLEN LOG ... ANN
          loses her GRASP and FALLS ... as the DINOSAUR SPRAWLS onto the
          ground beside her ... in a flash, KONG CATCHES HER mid-fall ...
          ROLLING AWAY as the TYRANNOSAUR LEAPS UP and tries to take another
          swipe.




           AST FEVERED ACTION: A pair of CARNIVOROUS DINOSAURS leap towards
          HER! They cling onto KONG'S ARM, clawing furiously, snapping at


           LOSE ON: Saliva flies from wild, snapping jaws.

          WIDE ON: KONG rolls over, THUMPING his arm against a TREE,
          crushing a DINOSAUR.

          ANN is WINDED ... she clings to KONG'S FINGERS as he strangles the
          second BEAST with one hand, snapping it's NECK with a BONE
          CRUNCHING sound.

            UDDENLY! A SECOND TYRANNOSAUR ATTACKS!!! He comes charging into
          shot, grabbing KONG'S ARM in his JAWS! KONG ROARS, sending both
          TYRANNOSAURS SPRAWLING TO THE GROUND. The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR
          scrambles back to it's feet! KONG holds ANN protectively as he
          braces himself for the FIGHT OF HIS LIFE. The TWO TYRANNOSAURS
          CIRCLE him ... when SUDDENLY! A THIRD TYRANNOSAUR comes from
          behind.

           hey ATTACK KONG and ANN ... a BREATHTAKING FIGHT to the DEATH.
          KONG fights like a madman on three separate fronts ... Not only
          does he have to do battle with the TYRANNOSAURS, he is also
          PROTECTING ANN - constantly transferring her from ONE HAND to THE
          OTHER as the TYRANNOSAURS SNAP AT HER HEELS.

          KONG punches and smashes with his fists, but he also uses
          wrestling-style headlocks and flips ... for a brief moment, ANN
          rolls free on the ground and has to dodge 25-foot DINOSAURS and
          the GORILLA, as the frenzied fight THUNDERS all around her.

          The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR is taken out when KONG LIFTS up a HUGE
          BOULDER and SMASHES it against the TYRANNOSAUR'S HEAD.

          KONG and the TWO TYRANNOSAURS slide down on to a ROCKY OUTCROP.

          KONG outs the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR in a HEADLOCK, FLIPPING it over
          his shoulder, and throwing it down into the CHASM. CLINGING ONTO

          AS IT FALLS it SNAPS AT KONG'S FOOT.


















          FALLS. AND more SMASHING AGAINST THE CHASM WALLS ... SHE FALLS AND





          WIDE ON: ANN faces the TYRANNOSAUR! SUDDENLY KONG THUDS DOWN


          BOTH ... and for a moment ANN &amp; KONG LOCK EYES. SHE THEN BACKS


           HE TYRANNOSAUR SNARLS at KONG and he ROARS BACK ... KONG THROWS
          ANN GENTLY to the side as HE and the TYRANNOSAUR LUNGE at each
          other.

          KONG GRABS HIS JAWS in BOTH HANDS forcing it OPEN and BITING the
          TYRANNOSAUR'S TONGUE. HE ROLLS the TYRANNOSAUR over and over,
          using all his strength to force the TYRANNOSAUR'S JAWS OPEN
          before RIPPING them clean APART at the HINGE! The TYRANNOSAUR
          sprawls back, DEAD.

          KONG is PANTING HEAVILY ... he has been BITTEN, RAKED and CUT.    He
          puts his foot on the LAST TYRANNOSAUR and BEATS HIS CHEST,
          TRIUMPHANTLY with a DEAFENING ROAR.


          his blood is up, he is ready to take on the world. HE STANDS NEXT

          ATTENTION BUT HE LOOKS AWAY. HE LUMBERS AWAY. KONG has DEADLY
          INTENT in his EYES. ANN watches as he DISAPPEARS into the JUNGLE.

          ANGLE ON: ANN, CONFUSED for a minute ... THEN RUNS AFTER HIM.


                    Wait!

          ANGLE ON: ANN is roughly SWUNG into the air, as KONG bounds off
          into the DEEP JUNGLE INTERIOR.

          ANN as she is suddenly SNATCHED UP by KONG and SWUNG ROUGHLY on to
          his SHOULDER.

          CLOSE ON: ANN HANGS ON for dear life as KONG GALLOPS into the


          KONG moves SWIFTLY and POWERFULLY through the JUNGLE with ANN on
          his SHOULDER ...





          ANGLE ON: ANN as she looks up at the GIANT GORILLA ... the
          tension seems to go out of her body, she relaxes into his HAND
          ... for the first time since coming to SKULL ISLAND she feels





          CLOSE ON: JACK STIRRING, immediately hearing the SCUTTLE OF
          INSECTS. HE ROLLS OVER and see's HUGE SPIDERS CRAWLING INTO THE
          PIT. HE staggers to his FEET ... REACHING INTO HIS PACK and PULLS
          from it A FLARE. THROWING it at the SPIDERS they CRAWL OFF.

          DENHAM is lying nearby.


                    Carl!!!





          CLOSE ON: JIMMY is looking VACANTLY into space, JACK kneels down.

                              JACK 
                    Jimmy?

          CLOSE ON: JIMMY looks up at JACK, there are tears filling his
          eyes. He falls into JACK'S arms softly sobbing.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM sitting up... dawning realization in his eyes.

          LUMPY, his back to CHOY ... he HOLDS CHOY'S HAND ... but CHOY'S
          FINGERS SLIDE LIMPLY out of LUMPY'S HAND ... LUMPY TURNS TO CHOY
          .. ONLY TO SEE THAT HE has DIED.

           NGLE ON: HAYES' eyes closed, his FACE peaceful, lying DEAD on the
          floor of the RAVINE.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM PEERING over a ROCK. The wreckage of the CAMERA
          lies smashed and broken on the CHASM floor ... a thin, shiny,
          thread of black FILM trailing from the smashed CAMERA body like
          spilt innards.

          DENHAM reaches out and touches the EXPOSED FILM ... his dreams




          CLOSE ON: JACK cradling JIMMY in his ARMS. HE LOOKS UP as he SEES
          the INSECTS CRAWL BACK.

          ANGLE ON: a HUGE six-foot CARNIVOROUS MAGGOT-THING squirms out!
          It crawls blindly towards LUMPY and CHOY!

          ANGLE ON: LUMPY pulling CHOY'S BODY to safety, but both are
          ATTACKED by LARGE INSECTS, the size of dogs!

          JACK tries to PULL THE GIANT CRAB-SPIDER OFF LUMPY, but instead it
          TURNS on him! More GIANT CRAB-SPIDERS JUMP at JACK.



          LUMPY and CHOY are CONSUMED by the nightmarish BUGS.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM is WIELDING a short stick like a CLUB ... he
          smashes the HUGE BUGS in a psychotic explosion of RAGE,
          pulverizing their bodies into the DIRT!

          All around, MONSTROSITIES OF NATURE emerge from DANK BURROWS and
          crawl towards the JACK, DENHAM and JIMMY ... these are HUGE
          INSECTILE MUTANTS - combinations of SPIDERS, CRABS, MANTISES and


          SUDDENLY JIMMY notices the TOMMY GUN sticking out of JACK'S PACK.
          GRABBING IT he aims at the INSECTS on JACK.

          BAM! BAM! BAM! The GIANT INSECTS are blown apart!

          JACK looks wildly around for DENHAM. THEY SEE that they're
          SURROUNDED BY SPIDERS. ANGLE ON: JACK desperately swings at the
          INSECTS with a STICK, whacking and stabbing them.

          BAM! BAM! BAM! GUNSHOTS RING OUT. SPIDERS SWARM out of HOLES in
          the CLIFF AND DIE. JACK spins around ... confused.

          ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN and a COUPLE of SAILORS OPEN FIRE from the LIP
          of the CHASM, SHOOTING the SPIDERS into SMITHEREENS!

          ANGLE ON: BRUCE SWINGS down from above, clinging to a VINE ... GUN


          BRUCE proceeds to lay waste to the INSECTS ... those not    blasted
          apart, scurrying away, back in to the darkness.




          Moving purposefully along a well-known route to his LAIR, KONG
          launches himself across a LOW CHASM ... one hand reaching out
          to clutch at THICK VINES on the other side ...

          SUDDENLY! The THICK VINES TEAR AWAY from the side of the CHASM
          WALL ... KONG falls backwards. ANN still clutched protectively
          to his CHEST he lands with a THUD!

          ANN looks up alarmed!

          KONG scrambles to his feet, GROWLING ... he places ANN on the
          GROUND pushing her protectively behind him.

          KONG POV: LOOMING out of the CHASM WALL is a HUGE FACE!

          CLOSE ON: ANN as her expression suddenly changes from FEAR to


          ANN walks past KONG ... who emits another LOW, WARNING GROWL.


                    It's alright ... it's okay ...

          ANN reaches the WALL and begins to pull away more of the VINES
          and CREEPERS to reveal ...



          A life-size and very life-like eroded STATUE of a SITTING
          GIANT GORILLA ... the IMAGE of KONG ...

          ANN turns back excitedly to KONG, trying to make him understand.

                              ANN 
                    Look - it's you ... "Kong". See ...
                    you. "Kong". This is you.

          KONG looks from ANN to the HUGE STATUE ...

          KONG POV: ANN is dwarfed by the STONE MONOLITH.

          PUSH IN on KONG ... a growing sense of REALISATION as he comes to
          understand the STATUE is in fact a reflection of himself.

          CLOSE ON: KONG looking down at his hands ... it's as if he is
          seeing his GNARLED, LEATHERY FINGERS for the first time.

          ANN moves towards KONG ... he looks at her ... there is a
          VULNERABLE EXPRESSION on his FACE ... FEAR and SADNESS well in his





          In VERTIGO-INDUCING shots, KONG climbs HIGHER and HIGHER - up into
          the HIGHEST PEAK of SKULL ISLAND ... carefully cradling ANN in his
          hand.

          A sudden FLAP OF WINGS and FLICKERING SHADOW causes KONG to pull
          ANN close to his chest as a sinister BAT-TYPE CREATURE lunges at
          her ... these SCAVENGERS hover in the SKIES around SKULL MOUNTAIN
          ... they have eight-foot wing spans and TALONED FEET. Their faces
          are more reptile than bat.









          WIDE ON: KONG steps out of a LARGE ROUND CAVE onto a LEDGE that
          juts out high over SKULL ISLAND ...

          This is KONG'S LAIR ... Over the ledge is a DIZZYING DROP of at
          least 1000-feet down to the JUNGLE.

          The "VENTURE" can be seen - moored off the TIP of the ISLAND, some
          three miles away.

           NGLE ON: KONG gently places ANN on the GROUND ... ANN watches as
          he moves away and sits to one side of the LEDGE.

          The SKY is a FIERY ORANGE as the SUN goes down ...   SILHOUETTING
          the FIGURE of KONG ...

          CLOSE ON: ANN looks around the CAVE taking in her STRANGE
          SURROUNDINGS ... her eyes fall upon a HUGE GORILLA SKULL and
          SKELETON which lie within the recesses of the CAVE ...

          ANN turns and looks back at KONG ... realizing these are the BONES
          of his FOREBEARS ... that KONG was not always alone.

            SUDDEN flutter in the DARK recesses of the LAIR, a SINISTER
          SOUND, sends ANN scurrying towards KONG ...

           ONG won't look at her.

          ANN breaks into a few tap steps ... NO RESPONSE. She leans   down
          and picks up some STONES ... JUGGLING them, attempting to amuse
          him as she did before. KONG's gaze remains averted ...

          He looks out over the JUNGLE CANOPY. ANN follows his GAZE, taking
          in the RUGGED LANDSCAPE which is bathed in the last EVENING RAYS
          of the SUN. She stares out to sea, a RAIN CLOUD casts shadows over
          the OCEAN.


                             
                    It's beautiful.

          KONG sits QUIETLY staring out over the JUNGLE ... she looks up at
          him.

                                 ANN 
                    Beautiful.

          ANN places her HAND against her heart.

                              ANN 
                    Beau-ti-ful.

          KONG'S BIG PAW unfurls beside ANN ... she hesitates for a moment,
          then CLIMBS into it.

          ANGLE ON: KONG gently lifts ANN ...





          WIDE ON: KONG with ANN, high above the JUNGLE, as the last of the





           LOSE ON: HANDS reach down as ENGLEHORN and a SAILOR PULL PRESTON
          up the last stretch of the ROPE ...

          ENGLEHORN turns and sees JACK climbing towards the TOP of the

          CHASM ... TWO SAILORS reaching down to help him.


                    Thank God.


                    Don't thank God, thank Mr. Baxter ...

          CLOSE ON: BRUCE PULLING HIMSELF UP THE ROPE, gasping from
          exertion.

                              ENGLEHORN 
                    He insisted on a rescue mission. Me? I
                    knew you'd be okay ...

          CLOSE ON: DENHAM looks up to see ENGLEHORN standing at the top of
          the CHASM. ENGLEHORN is watching him IMPASSIVELY.

                              ENGLEHORN 
                    That's the thing about cockroaches; no
                    matter how many times you flush them
                    down the toilet they always crawl back
                    up the bowl!

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM as he rises to his feet.


                     ey buddy! I'm outta the bowl! I'm
                    drying off my wings and trekking
                    across the lid!

          ENGLEHORN LOOKS at DENHAM a BEAT and then LOOKS across the CHASM
          in SURPRISE. DENHAM FOLLOWS HIS GAZE.

          WIDE ON: JACK at the TOP of the opposite side of the CHASM ... a
          solitary figure, bloodied and torn.


                    Driscoll ... don't be a fool! Give it
                    up, it's useless ... She's dead.


                             
                    She's not dead. Jack's gonna bring her
                    back.

          ENGLEHORN turns to DENHAM.



                              DENHAM 
                    And the ape will be hard on his heels.
                    We can still come out of this thing
                    okay -
                             
                    More than okay. Think about it, you've
                    got a boat full of chloroform we can
                    put to good use.

          ENGLEHORN looks at DENHAM for a BEAT and then LAUGHS.


                    You want to trap the Ape? I don't
                    think so.


                    Isn't that what you do? Live animal
                    capture? I heard you were the best.

          ENGLEHORN stares at DENHAM for a moment, it is impossible to know
          what he is thinking.

                                 DENHAM 
                    Jack!

          JACK looks at DENHAM D
                               ... DENHAM raises a hand in salute.

                              DENHAM 
                             
                    Look after yourself!


                    Keep the Gate open.


                    Sure thing, buddy! Good luck!

          ANGLE ON: JACK turns to go ... and disappears up the DARK TUNNEL.

                                 DENHAM 
                    I'm sorry.




          ANGLE ON: JACK struggles through the JUNGLE ... he breaks into
          CLEARING and STOPS SHORT as he see's the VAST VISTA of the
          MOUNTAIN in front of him.




          ANGLE ON: MOONLIGHT steams into the CAVE ... KONG sits on his


          CLOSE ON: ANN SLEEPS PEACEFULLY in his HAND.

          ANGLE ON: KONG gently lifts ANN ... he STARES at her ... his
          FINGER touches ANN'S HAIR.









          ANGLE ON: JACK is climbing up through ROCKS towards KONG'S LAIR!

          BAT-THINGS flutter ... AGITATED ... SENSING an INTRUDER.

          CLOSE ON: JACK freezes.

           NGLE ON: A LARGE NUMBER of BAT-THINGS are GATHERING amid the
          STALACTITES that hang from the ROOF of the CAVERN.

          He scans the LAIR for any sign of ANN ... but can't see her. The
          OLD BONES of a LARGE GORILLA lie across the CAVE from JACK.

           ACK CLIMBS higher INTO THE CAVE until at last he's on THE LEDGE


          ANGLE ON: JACK moves forward, towards KONG. He stays in the
          SHADOWS of the ROCKS.

          JACK CRAWLS FORWARD onto the LEDGE.




          ANGLE ON: JACK creeps CLOSE to the SLEEPING KONG'S BACK ... his
          SHOULDERS gently heaving with each breath.

           LOSE ON: JACK crawls past KONG'S FEET ... he looks in AMAZEMENT.

          ... ANN is ASLEEP in KONG'S HAND!

           LOSE ON: KONG GROWLS ... JACK SPINS AROUND ... KONG is growling
          in his sleep!

          JACK is less than 8 FEET away from ANN.

          CLOSE ON: ANN'S eyes OPEN. For a MOMENT she stares blankly at JACK
          ... then REALISATION arrives quickly - he has come for her! She
          looks at JACK with disbelief.

           LOSE ON: JACK looks at ANN, drawing a finger to his lips ...
          neither DARES to move, or make a sound.

           ERY SLOWLY, JACK rises and steps towards ANN. He gestures for her
          to stay motionless in KONG'S PALM.

           NGLE ON: The salivating, carnivorous BAT-THINGS flutter out of
          the CAVE and SWARM around the LEDGE ... their FEAR of KONG is
          overwhelmed by the tempting SIGHT of JACK and ANN.



          CLOSE ON: JACK extends his HAND towards ANN ... she reaches out
          ... their FINGERS TOUCH ...

          ... and KONG'S EYES SNAP OPEN!






          TIME seems to SLOW: JACK attempts to GRAB ANN'S WRIST, but KONG'S
          FINGERS CLOSE around ANN with stunning SPEED! KONG ROLLS to his
          FEET, pulling ANN away from JACK!

           NGLE ON: KONG SNARLS at JACK, who now stands HELPLESSLY before
          him.

          The BAT-THINGS SWARM above KONG.


                             
                    Jack, run!

          ANGLE ON: KONG SWATS at JACK with his FREE HAND. ANN struggles and
          KICKS in his GRASP. A

                              ANN 
                             
                    No!

          KONG places ANN high on a SMALL LEDGE and CHARGES at JACK!

           NGLE ON: JACK ROLLS to the SIDE, KONG'S FISTS smashing DOWN
          around him!

           ONG STAMPS on JACK, who DIVES CLEAR, just as the HUGE FOOT
          pummels into the GROUND.

          CLOSE ON: JACK is LYING on the GROUND with KONG rearing above him
          ... there is NO ESCAPE!

          CLOSE ON: KONG'S EYES, blazing with DEADLY INTENT. He LIFTS his
          FOOT, ready to SQUASH JACK like a bug!

          AT THAT MOMENT! ANN SHRIEKS in PAIN!

          KONG spins around ...

          ANGLE ON: ANN is under ATTACK from the BAT-THINGS ... they are
          FRENZYING around ANN, sharp CLAWS lashing her! She cowers against
          the ROCK FACE, trying to protect herself.

          CLOSE ON: KONG ... ROARING with ANGER ... he abandons JACK and
          CHARGES at the BAT-THINGS!

          The FRENZIED BAT-THINGS ATTACK KONG EN MASSE as he snatches ANN
          from the LEDGE.

          They strike at KONG and ANN like a swarm of giant bees. KONG ROARS
          and THRASHES OUT at them in a FRENZY!

            NGLE ON: KONG puts ANN down against the ROCKS, so he can use BOTH
          HANDS to strike at the DEADLY BAT-THINGS. With every sweep of his
          ARM, several BAT-THINGS are KNOCKED TO THE GROUND, but OTHERS claw
          at his HEAD and BODY.

           NGLE ON: JACK seizes his CHANCE! He rushes along the EDGE of the
          CLIFF towards ANN ... under the cover of an OVERHANG.





          JACK and ANN are inches away from each other right behind KONG'S


           ACK grabs ANN'S HAND and leads her towards the only possible
          escape route - the EDGE of the LEDGE, 1000 FEET above the JUNGLE!

          JACK grabs a LARGE VINE, testing it's strength. He turns to     Ann.


                             
                    This way! Come on!

          JACK pulls ANN to him and clambers over the EDGE of the   DIZZYING





          WIDE ON: JACK and ANN desperately CLIMB down the THICK VINES that
          hang over the LEDGE ... hand over hand ... the SOUND of KONG
          ROARING above, as he battles the BAT-THINGS.




          ANGLE ON: SEVERAL BAT-THINGS are gripping and CLAWING KONG'S BACK
          in an effort to weaken the huge ape ... he suddenly POUNDS HIS
          BACK against the WALL of the CAVE, SQUASHING THEM ALL!

          The surviving BAT-THINGS wheel away from KONG, HISSING ANGRILY ...
          16 lie on the cave floor, STUNNED or DEAD. They FLUTTER towards
          the BACK OF THE CAVE, preparing their NEXT ATTACK.

          KONG LOOKS for ANN ... she has GONE!




          ANGLE ON: JACK and ANN are 60 FEET down the VINE ... JACK is
          trying to SWING towards the ROCK FACE ...

          SUDDENLY! They start RISING!

          WIDE ON: KONG is PULLING on the VINE! He lifts JACK and ANN
          towards HIM, like a fisherman reeling in a catch.

          ANN tightens her grip on JACK'S SHOULDERS as BAT-THINGS flutter
          around THEM.

           NGLE ON: JACK and ANN are HELPLESS ... KONG almost HAS THEM! BAT-
          THINGS dive towards JACK and ANN!

          A BAT-THING CLAWS at JACK'S HEAD. He releases ONE HAND and GRABS
          it's TALONED ANKLE.


                             
                    Hang on to me!





          ANN hangs onto JACK for dear life, as he GRABS the BAT-THINGS


          ANGLE ON: JACK and ANN DESCENDING RAPIDLY ... the BAT-THING
          furiously FLAPPING it's WINGS, but unable to stop the SPIRALLING
          plunge past the CLIFF FACE.

          SOUNDS of KONG ROARING WITH GRIEF FROM THE LEDGE.




          The BAT-THING wobbles crazily in the sky, rapidly LOSING ENERGY
          ... JACK looks down - a FAST FLOWING RIVER is 50 feet below. He


          ANN SCREAMS as she and JACK fall into the RIVER ... they are
          immediately picked up by the current and SWEPT AWAY.

          JACK and ANN are carried into the RAPIDS, swept down a small
          WATERFALL, surfacing into a FAST-FLOWING, but less violent part of
          the river.




          KONG ROARS with ANGER and GRIEF.

                    No woman is worth this!


                    This woman is worth it. I've gotta win

                    Oh! I'm sorry - I couldn't help but

          The TWO WOMEN look at him a beat before turning back to each
          other.


                    He's looking into my eyes -


                    And that's when he told you how he
                    felt?


                    No - he never said it.

                    He probably thought he didn't need to
                    say it.




                    Then how does she know that it's real?


                    He said it was not about the words.


                    Please - if you feel it, you say it.
                    It's really very simple.





                    He said we'd talk about it later. Only
                    there was no later ...

          mixture of PRIDE and ANTICIPATION.

          The SOUND of KONG BREATHING - a RASPING WEAK GROWL - causes DENHAM
          to flick his eyes to the darkened AREA behind the CURTAIN.




          ANGLE ON: ANN in HER DRESSING ROOM pulling on her COSTUME.








          WIDE ON: The HUGE AUDITORIUM is filled with nearly 2000 people.
          The EXCITEMENT in the air is PALPABLE.

          WIDE ON: The LARGE CROWD APPLAUDS as DENHAM strides onto the stage
          in the GLARE of THE SINGLE SPOTLIGHT. He waves enthusiastically to
          the AUDIENCE, basking in the acclaim he   has wanted for so long.


                     hank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank
                    you! Ladies and Gentlemen, I am here
                    to tell you a very strange story ... a
                    story of our adventure in which
                    seventeen of our party suffered
                    horrible deaths! Their lives lost in
                    pursuit of a savage Beast, a monstrous
                    aberration of nature! But even the
                    meanest brute can be tamed. Yes,
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, as you will see,
                    the Beast was no match for the charms
                    of a girl - a girl from New York ...
                    who melted his heart. Bringing to mind
                    that old Arabian proverb ...




          CLOSE ON: ANN, now in a WHITE VELVET GOWN, a look of SADNESS   in
          her EYES.

                    "And lo the Beast looked upon the face
                    of Beauty and Beauty stayed his hand
                    ... and from that day forward he was
                    as one dead ..."

          A VOICE interrupts ANN'S contemplation.


                    You're on, Miss Darrow, five minutes.

          ANN stands up ...




          DENHAM basking in the SPOTLIGHT.


                     nd now Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, I'm going
                    to show you the greatest thing your
                    eyes have ever beheld. He was a King
                    in the world he knew but he comes to

          STAGE MUSIC strikes up.




          WIDE ON: With a DRAMATIC FLOURISH the CURTAIN slowly rises to


          KONG sitting slumped and unresponsive, his WRISTS MANACLED to   a
          STEEL SCAFFOLD. Other MANACLES and CHAINS secure his ANKLES, NECK
          and WAIST.

          There is a BIG GASP from the AUDIENCE ... KONG'S sheer size is


          CLOSE ON: DENHAM ... euphoric, as the collective GASP of 2000
          PEOPLE washes over him.

           NGLE ON: KONG's head lolls, as if he is barely aware of his
          surroundings ...


                    Don't be alarmed, ladies and
                    gentlemen. It is perfectly safe. These
                    chains are made of chrome steel!






          ANGLE ON: JACK, jostled on a crowded NEW YORK STREET hurrying
          rapidly along the sidewalk.

                    beast! I am actually laying my hand on
                    the twenty-five foot gorilla.

          DENHAM reaches up and touches KONG'S LEG. KONG'S foot twitches
          slightly causing DENHAM to jump back in fright ...

           LOSE ON: JACK enters the AUDITORIUM.

          ANGLE ON: DENHAM signals to the STAGE HANDS in the WINGS ...





          ANGLE ON: A STAGE HAND begins to CRANK a WINCH ... the CHAINS
          at KONG'S WRISTS tighten ... the AUDIENCE GASP as KONG is SLOWLY
          FORCED to his FULL HEIGHT ...

          ANGLE ON: JACK walks into the BACK of the BALCONY of the
          darkened AUDITORIUM. He quietly makes his way down the SHADOWED

          ANGLE ON: BRUCE striding on stage, dressed as the Great White
          Hunter.

           UGE AUDIENCE ACCLAIM! DENHAM shakes BRUCE by the hand, slapping
          him on the BACK as if they were OLD FRIENDS ... BRUCE turns and
          acknowledges the ADULATION of the AUDIENCE.

          A LINE of DANCERS, dressed as cheesy NATIVES appear from   either
          side of the stage. They dance to the beat, playing to KONG, who
          stares impassively at them.

          A PULSATING DRUM BEAT begins to fill the AUDITORIUM!

                              DENHAM 
                    Ladies and Gentlemen, imagine if you
                    will an uncharted island ... a
                    forgotten fragment from another time

                    savage place, imagine a people
                    untutored in the ways of the civilised

          ANGLE ON: PRESTON turns to look at JACK ... JACK'S EYES   flicker
          towards the SCAR which runs down one side of PRESTON'S CHEEK ...


                             
                    That's the thing you come to learn
                    about Carl ... his unfailing ability
                    to destroy the things he loves.

          She is tied to a wooden ALTAR, her BACK to the audience.

          CLOSE ON: KONG, a flicker of HOPE in his EYES.

          The TINY FIGURE tethered to the ALTAR looks up! For the first
          time KONG sees her FACE.

          ANGLE ON: KONG staring at FAKE ANN with mounting CONFUSION and


          CLOSE ON: JACK as he realises it is not ANN on stage. He turns

          CLOSE ON: JACK glances at PRESTON, who turns away looking



                             
                    Where's Ann?


                    I've no idea. I heard he offered her
                    all kinds of money and she turned him
                    down flat.

          dressed ...

          who ROARS ANGRILY.

          DENHAM signals to BRUCE to join him ... behind them we can see the
          FAKE ANN still performing her feigned terror ...


                    Here's your story, boys - "Beauty and

          chains.


                    How did you feel, Mr. Baxter - when
                    you were on the island?


                    Well to be honest with you, I had some
                    anxious moments ...

          The MEMBERS of the PRESS all nod, understandingly ...

                              BRUCE 
                    For a while there it looked like I
                    wasn't going to get paid ... But as it
                    turned out, Mr. Denham here has been
                    more than generous -

          of the audience to leave.

          KONG ROARS and hurls a PLASTER CORNICE across the length of the
          THEATRE - straight at JACK!

          hesitates ... realizing who is behind the wheel of the CAB!

           ACK'S POV ... as KONG comes closer. PANICKING DRIVERS PILE into
          each other. JACK desperately tries his door, but it won't open, he
          is WEDGED IN by CARS on either side.

          KONG LIFTS THE CAR directly in front - HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD,
          throwing it into a BUILDING.




          CLOSE ON:   JACK'S FOOT depresses ACCELERATOR.

          The WHEELS are SPINNING WILDLY ... in a CLOUD OF BURNING RUBBER,
          the CAB speeds down the ROAD, weaving in and out of the path cut
          by KONG'S DESTRUCTION.

          KONG BOUNDS AFTER THE CAB, running on all FOURS with incredible
          speed.

          JACK crosses an INTERSECTION, driving up on the SIDEWALK to get a
          CLEARER DRIVING LANE ... PEDESTRIANS scatter - not only from the
          CAB, but from KONG who is in HOT PURSUIT.

           he CAB SLEWS across the STREET, disappearing up a TINY ALLEY,
          only just wide enough for the CAB, but TOO NARROW for KONG.

          JACK glances back at KONG, ROARING with frustration at the ALLEY





          JACK speeds out of the ALLEY and CROSSES the TRAFFIC FLOW, causing
          much BRAKING and HORN action. He gets SLOWED in THICK TRAFFIC ...

          KONG BURSTS his way out of the ALLEY ENTRANCE ... RIGHT IN FRONT


          JACK SWERVES on to the SIDEWALK ...





          JACK steers the CAB wildly along the SIDEWALK scattering
          PEDESTRIANS in all directions!

          KONG follows in HOT PURSUIT!

           ACK sends the CAB into a couple of TIGHT TURNS ... he rounds a
          bend and DRIVES straight into a FRUIT VENDOR'S STALL!

          ANGLE ON: The CAB, covered by the RUINED STALL, SLAMS into the
          WALL of a BUILDING. JACK is thrown forward on IMPACT ...

          KONG rounds the corner and BOUNDS PAST JACK'S CAB ... hidden
          beneath the RUBBLE ...

          KONG searches for the CAB, ROARING in FRUSTRATION!

          KONG'S HUGE EYES glance in the WINDOW, just as:

          KONG suddenly FREEZES! He inclines his HEAD; unsure if what he is
          seeing is REAL.

          KONG'S POV: ANN is walking towards him!

          KONG tentatively inches TOWARDS ANN!

          ANN stops ... KONG stops. They stare at each other for a long
          moment ... ANN offers KONG a small SMILE, and reaches her HAND out
          hesitantly towards his ARM.

           ONG gently picks ANN up ... his EYES never leaving her FACE.

          ANN holds tightly on to his HAND and they DISAPPEAR into the
          night.

          hand hits the ice he slips ...

          KONG stands up and growls ... he slips again, spinning this time
          ... it becomes a game ...

          CLOSE ON: ANN realizing what is happening ... She starts to LAUGH.

          LIGHTS spin past ... it is a brief moment of respite ...

          ROARING with ANGER KONG struggles out from the FROZEN POND and
          flees ... back on to the STREETS of NEW YORK.




          KONG bounds out into the streets, swaying to avoid the bullet
          fire, angrily smashing cars out the way.

          ANGLE ON: The TRUCK flipping through the AIR as KONG continues on
          his way through the STREETS ...

          KONG ROARS DEFIANTLY as the GUN'S BARREL swings in their
          direction!

          The STREETS are TEEMING with these VEHICLES as the ARMY spreads
          out across town in the hunt for KONG.

          ARMY VEHICLES are RACING along the QUIET STREETS ... an ARMORED
          CAR is firing at KONG ... followed by a TRUCK carrying a MOBILE


          KONG bounds into a construction site, climbing with ease up
          through the frame.

          A MILITARY TRUCK races through the STREETS of NEW YORK ... still

          ANOTHER SEARCHLIGHT FINDS HIM! ... and ANOTHER! The ARMY are
          closing in. MACHINE-GUN FIRE rips past him as he LEAPS another
          GREAT DISTANCE across the STREET. ANN clings on, shutting her


          As BULLETS WHIZZ around him, KONG LEAPS ACROSS THE STREET - 10
          stories high! He LANDS on the opposite ROOFTOP and BOUNDS AWAY.

          ANGLE ON: JACK running along the STREET, following a STREAM of
          POLICE and MILIARY VEHICLES.

            RMORED CARS and MOBILE SEARCHLIGHTS converge on KONG ... ahead of

          holding ANN protectively to his CHEST.

          JACK runs forward amidst the noise and confusion he stares up at
          the long length of the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING ...

          WIDE SHOT ... KONG climbing the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, silhouetted
          against the LIGHTENING SKY.

          foot drop to the street below.

          KONG climbs onto the OBSERVATION DECK of the EMPIRE STATE
          BUILDING. He gently places ANN down ... a CHILL WIND catches at
          her DRESS. ANN looks up at KONG ... BLOOD slowly seeps from his
          numerous WOUNDS ...






          KONG sits still, staring out across the CITY ...

          To the EAST the sun is rising, casting an soft glow over
          buildings ... glinting off the WATERS of the EAST...

           ONG looks down at ANN ... he gestures with his hands ... touching
          his heart ... ANN looks at him confused, he repeats the gesture

          SIX NAVAL BIPLANES suddenly ROAR INTO SHOT, sweeping low over the
          DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT ... and closing in on KONG. These are
          TWO-SEATERS, armed with TWIN MACHINE-GUNS for the PILOT, and a
          flexible MACHINE-GUN for the OBSERVER.

          CLOSE ON: PILOT'S FINGER on trigger.

          A COLD WIND blows ANN'S hair as she watches the PLANES approach.
          KONG is UNEASY about these BUZZING PREDATORS as they CIRCLE above
          him.

          The NAVAL PLANES peel off into an ATTACKING DIVE at KONG.

          DOWN GUN-SIGHTS ... drifting left and right as KONG grows in size


          KONG is suddenly FEARFUL ... he INSTINCTIVELY pushes ANN towards
          the BUILDING'S WALL!

          The PLANES split to either side of KONG, ZOOMING straight at him!

          KONG ROARS at the PLANES, as if issuing a CHALLENGE.

          losing her.

          ANN stares at him a beat ... tears begin to spill from her
          eyes. Slowly she rises to her feet and walks hesitantly towards
