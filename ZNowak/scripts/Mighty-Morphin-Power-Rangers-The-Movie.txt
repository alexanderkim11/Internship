               In a time of great strife, a
               legendary interdimensional being
               known as Zordon, came to the city
               of Angel Grove to establish a
               vanguard in the never ending
               struggle against evil.  with the
               aid of his trusted assistant,
               Alpha 5, the noble master sought
               out six extraordinary teenagers
               and gave them the power to
               transform into an unstoppable
               fighting force.  In time of great
               need, the young heroes could now
               call upon colossal assault
               vehicles known as "Zords".  while
               the identity of the six remained
               a guarded secret, their
               courageous exploits soon became
               the stuff of Legend, earning them
               the title...  The Mighty Morphin
               Power Rangers.

We hear PUMPING ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC as the POWER RANGER'S LOGO
BURST'S ONTO THE SCREEN.  Now the logo EXPLODES, revealing




A prop plane whisking across the deep blue sky.


               YeeeoowwWWWWW!!!




The six Power Rangers, TOMMY, KIMBERLY, BILLY, AISHA, ADAM and
ROCKY sport sleek sky diving suits, parachute packs and 
helmets.  Tommy is strapped into a high-tech airboard.


               We're OUTTA here!!


               Easy, Rock.        


               Once we hit the target zone we've
               got fifteen seconds to make the
               drop.


               Step aside, pinheads.

BULK and SKULL push their way through the Rangers, decked
in bizarre skydiving regalia, topped off by World War II
leather caps and aviator goggles.


               The Stealth Eagle is about to
               fly.


               Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.

The Rangers exchange amused looks.  Aisha gestures to them


               Lead on, flyboys.

Bulk and Skull swagger to the door and open it - the ground
is a dizzying distance below.  They swallow hard.


               Bulk... where'd the earth go?


               Five seconds to the target zone!


               Aisha  you' re  on !

Bulk and Skull step aside, Aisha LAUNCHES herself.

The others follow through the opening with flair.


               Stylin!


               On your tail!


               All systems

Tommy and Kimberly share an infectious glance, Kimberly
a hand, indicating Tommy should go first.


               Surf's up!

He's gone.  Kimberly stands backwards in the doorway.


               Catch you on the flipside.

Bulk and Skull watch wide-eyed as she BACK-FLIPS
out of the plane.




ROCK AND ROLL fills the track as the Rangers plunge towards
earth, executing a series of MIND-BOGGLING MANEUVERS: SPINS,
FISHTAILS, POWER DIVES, BACK FLIPS, you name it.



Bulk and Skull psyche themselves up.


               Be the eagle.  Be the eagle.


               Be the swallow.  Be the
               swallow...

They take deep breaths then CHARGE THE DOOR.


               Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!

Naturally, they get STUCK, wedged shoulder to shoulder.
THE PILOT glances back, CHUCKLES and BANKS THE PLANE.




Bulk and Skull rotate into frame.  Now, facing straight down --
they FALL INTO CAMERA, CLINGING TO EACH OTHER DESPERATELY






The Rangers pull off more SPECTACULAR MANEUVERS
then swoop TOGETHER, interlocking hands and forming a


They look to one another and a moment of pure magic passes
between them.  It's not  usual the exhilaration of flight they're
sharing, it s the exhilaration of togetherness, of being part
of a team.


               Let's BREAK!!

They disperse and yank their rip-cords.  The sky BURSTS TO LIFE
WITH SIX BLOSSOMING PARACHUTES -- white, pink, blue, yellow ,
red and black in color.



FAMILIES eat hot dogs and cotton candy at a huge fundraiser .
A large banner proclaims "SAVE THE OBSERVATORY."  We see
diving teams with labeled uniforms -- the BOWLING TEAM, ANGEL
GROVE P.D.  and the FIRE DEPARTMENT.  There s a large white
"BULLSEYE" spray-painted on the grass.  The city's
spectacular large skyline rises out of the b.g.

A SPUNKY MR. KELMAN stands at a podium, speaking into a mic.


               Okay, so the firemen landed four
               out of six inside the target --

A BOWLER shouts out playfully.


               How `bout a show tune?!

Mr. Kelman feigns seriousness.


               Somebody wanna keep chose bowlers
               in line.

A hip thirteen year old, FRED KELMAN, yells out as he points
to the sky.


               Hey dad, get with the program!


               Ladies and gentlemen, it's Angel
               Grove High

ANGEL ON TARGET - AS AISHA touches down flawlessly.


               And that's one!  A perfect
               landing!

Aisha clears, then Billy and Adam land toqether.


               Three for three.  Look at `em go!

Billy and Adam clear and now Rocky and Kimberly come in.


               That's five perfect landings!
               Now it's all up to Tommy Oliver.

Everybody watches with dumbfounded expressions as Tommy SAILS
IN ON HIS AIR BOARD AND SLIDES INTO DEAD CENTER.  He spreads
his arms wide.


               Touch down.

The families CHEER and APPLAUD as they surge forward to
congratulate the Rangers.

Mr. Kelman and Fred approach Tommy -  Fred and Tommy exchange
stylish hand slaps.


               Looking good up there.


               Thanks, man.


               Congratulations - the
               Observatory's got a new lease on
               life.


               Awesome!   Ryan's Comet is passing
               over in two days!

The other Rangers approach.


               Who's up for lunch?


               You read my mind.


               Last one to Ernies buys.


               Let's roll!




We hear a VOCIFEROUS SISSING SOUND, but we can't see where  it's
coming from. - Suddenly the six Rangers come SCREAMING AROUND A
CORNER ON STATE-OF-THE-ART ROLLERBLADES.  These kids are FLYING!!

We hear FULL-THROTTLED MUSIC as the kids WEAVE, DUCK and SWERVE
like blading virtuosos.  Tommy LEAPS in the air, does a 180 and



THE HIGH BRANCHES.past a large tree as Bulk and Skull DROP INTO



               Stealth Eagle, huh?  The Lame
               Duck is more like it!



The Rangers GLIDE around another corner -- there's buildings on
one side of them and a construction site on the other.


               Let's take the shortcut!

Tommy leads them up a plywood ramp -- they LAUNCH TEN FEET

MAKE SPECTACULAR LANDINGS on the construction site parking
structure.

As they shoot across the concrete, the CAMERA PUSHES IN on:

10   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTtZUCTION SITE - DAY                   10

... WORKERS operating heavy machinery -- cranes, bulldozer ,
etc., Construction Worker  jackhammers solid rock.  Drill
makes a CLANGING SOUND as it HITS METAL!  A baffled look comes
over him as he stops the jackhammer, brushes away debris..
uncovering an ANCIENT IRON PLATE.  He gapes at it, too stunned
to speak.



A large hook has been fastened to the iron plate -- a crane
ENGINE ROARS as it HOISTS THE PLATE UP, revealing a CAVERNOUS


TWO MORE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS have joined the first, all of
them look on in amazement.


               Whadda you figure it is?!


               Hey, ya got me.

Suddenly a PURPLE STEAM POURS from the opening.  And now
something really amazing happens.   ..

A menacing STONE CLAW RISES UP, CRADLING A HUGE STONE


               ... I'll be damned.

As though drawn by it's power, he moves to touch it.










A T.V.  REPORTER is talking into camera.


               We're here at the World Center
               Construction Site, where a
               mysterious object was just
               uncovered in a freak accident in
               which one workman suffered minor
               injuries...



thru    OMITTED






We see the reporter then a few cuts of GEOLOGISTS combing the
site with scanning equipment and COPS sealing off the area with
yellow tape.


               ... Angel Grove Police have
               cordoned off the area until it
               can be determined whether or not
               the unidentified object poses any
               threat.  The injured workman was
               quoted as saying...



The Rangers are at a table -- Tommy is teaching Fred martial arts
moves.


               It's one smooth move and then
               you've gotta explode off the top.

Tommy executes a wicked JUMPING ROUNDHOUSE KICK.  Fred is
wowed.  He drops into position.


               Nice and easy.

The jovial proprietor, ERNIE, approaches the Rangers' table
with a loaded tray.  Fred pulls off a dazzling JUMPING
ROUNDHOUSE KICK and almost knocks Ernie's tray over.


               Hey, no Karate on the patio!


               Actually, Ernie, it's Tae-Kwan
               Doe.


               Well Tae-Kwan-Do-it some place
               else.

Fred moves off as Ernie serves the desserts.


               So, what're the plans for the
               weekend?


               Aisha and.I are checking out a
               new dance spot.


               I heard that!


               I'll be at the Observatory
               Sunday.


               That's right - Ryan's Comet.


               We should throw a little comet
               shindig.


               Any excuse for a party.

Aisha reacts to something off screen.


               The Eagle has landed.

Bulk and Skull swagger past followed by a GROUP OF KIDS.


               The earth was hurtling toward us
               at seven hundred miles per hour,
               and we knew at that moment that
               we were facing death straight in
               the eye.


               We could smell it's breath.

Ernie moves off after Bulk and Skull.  Tommy's wrist
communicator BEEPS.  The kids exchange glances than look for a
private area.


               There's a spot over there.

They move out of everybody's sight.

                              TOMMY 
               What's up, Alpha?


               Rangers, we need you at the
               Command  Center,  L.R.N. !

Aisha gives Kimberly a puzzled look.


               'Like Right Now.'


               We're on our way.

They hit their wrist-communicators and instantly TRANSFORM
INTO SIX IRIDESCENT COLUMNS OF COLOR.  The columns SHOOT UP
THROUGH a giant oak tree, KNOCKING LEAVES LOOSE.



Zordon's remote headquarters protrudes from a craggy
mountain top -- silhouetted by a glorious sunset.  The SIX STREAK 
OF COLOR slice downward into the roof.



Everything's gone haywire   buttons BLINK, emergency
lights FLASH, there's a CACOPHONY OF ELECTRONIC SOUNDS.

ALPHA 5 works frantically amidst the array of computer
banks while ZORDON looks on from his COLUMN OF LIGHT.

The six Rangers MATERIALIZE, Tommy turns to Zordon.


               What's happening?


               Ay,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi !  Our
               thermionic-sensors have been hit
               by a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil!


               Rangers, you must act swiftly.
               The planet is in GRAVE danger!


               Danger from what?


               Six thousand years ago a
               morphological being known as Ivan
               Ooze, ruled the world with a
               reign of unparalleled terror.
               Finally, a rebel factor known as
               the "Order of the Meledon" lured
               him into a hyperlock chamber and
               buried him deep underground.


               In a place that came to be known
               as Angel Grove.


               The chamber has been accidently
               UNCOVERED!  You must return it to
               the depths. or  anyone should
               open it and Ivan is released!


               To assist you I have retro-fitted
               your helmets with new Opti-Scan
               devices.


               Use extreme caution, Rangers.
               You are dealing with an evil here
               that is beyond ALL comprehension.




Barricades and police tape surround the egg.  A  SECURITY GUARD
passes his sleeping CO-WORKER, drops into a chair, sips his
coffee.                   

BZZWAPP -- ZEDD, RITA, GOLDAR and a short, fat, furry creature
named MORDANT appear.


               Another Saturday night and I'm
               traipsing around the galaxy with
               the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother
               warned me this would happen!
               Rita, she said, after 89
               marriages you might wanna think
               about throwing in the towel.  Why
               didn't I listen to her?!

Zedd grumbles to himself.


               That's a good question.

The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy.


               Uh... Kurt...  you might wanna
               take a look at this.

Kurt looks up groggily.


               No need to wake him.  In fact,
               why don't you take a little nap
               yourself.

Zedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are
knocked out.

Goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or
Mordant's foot.  Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg.


               Hey bonehead, get off my hoof!

Goldar is oblivious.  Zedd, stands reverently before the
glowing egg shape.


               After two thousand years of
               searching...  I have finally
               found you.

Mordant BANGS on Goldar's leg again.


               Yo, earth to Bigfoot!

Goldar SWATS Mordant.


               Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball!




                              RITA 
               Where did you FIND this rabid
               little rodent, anyway?!


               Mordant's my second cousin three
               times removed on my mother's
               side.  He`s just visiting for the
               summer.


               Well put a muzzle on him!

Mordant GRUMBLES under his breath.  Meanwhile, Zedd aims  is
staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy.  The egg
opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air.  webs of
ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE.

When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT
OOZE.  The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in  o
the sticky substance.


               What... you spent two thousand
               years looking for this tub of


As if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS.  Zedd and Rita
are too busy arguing to notice this.


               Don't you ever have anything nice
               to say?!


               Well, if I did I certainly
               wouldn't say it to you!

We hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP
AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE.  Mordant tugs at Zedd.


               Boss.


               For your information this is not
               just your average, run-of-the-
               mill tub of snot ! 


               You're trying to tell me there`re
               different levels of snot?!


               Boss.




Zedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips
apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of


He stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts
his hands on his head, CRACKS it.


               Ahhhhhhhh.

Now he SMACKS his lips together, opens his arms theatrically
and gives his trademark stance.


               Ladies and Gentlemen... the OOZE
               is back!!

Rita blushes.


               He's so cute.

Zedd flashes her an angry look, turns back to Ivan.


               I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy of
               all that is good and decent.  It
               is a supreme honor to finally
               meet you.

Ivan gives a slight bow.


               How can I ever repay you?


               Do you recall the name...  Zordon
               of Eltare?

Ivan's face goes dark, THUNDER RUMBLES and the site LIGHTS UP
WITH A FLASH OF LIGHTNING.  Mordant turns to Goldar.


               Seems to ring a bell.


               I want you to destroy Zordon, so
               that my evil may once again reign


                              IVAN 
               I will not only destroy him, I
               will OBLITERATE his entire being.
               It will be like Zordon
               of Eltare never EXISTED!


               Finally, a real man.

Goldar hands Ivan a scrap of paper.


               Here's his address.

                              IVAN 
               "... left off Interstate 12?!"

                     
               What's an "interstate"?


               It's like a freeway.  How long
               have  you  been  locked  up? !


               We shall leave you to weave your
               wicked ways.


               Now we go out on the town.  First
               dinner, then dancing, then --

BZZWAPP!!  The foursome DE-MATERIALIZE.


               What is that odious stench?

His eyes come alive.


               Smell's like...   TEENAGERS!





On cue, the Power Rangers TELEPORT into the construction site.

They're surrounded by rock piles, pools of water and a plethora
of building supplies.  Billy looks down at the mud puddle he's
standing in.


               Remind me to have a word with
               Alpha about his teleporting
               calculations.

They survey the construction site for a moment.


               Anybody see anything?


               ... Let's take a look over there.

They advance up a slope -- the egg comes into view.

                              ROCKY 
               It looks like it's been opened!

The kids get close to the egg, looking it over with
fascination.  Suddenly a hand falls on Aisha.


               Hey!

They all whirl around and see the first Security Guard.  He
half smiles, shaking his head.


               You had me scared there.


               Makes two of us.


               You haven't by any chance seen
               a ... morphological being lurking
               around?


               The only thing I've seen is you
               teenagers.
                              
               And you know... if there's one
               thing in the world I reeeeally
               hate....

CLOSE ON HIS FACE as it SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO THE+ HIDEOUS VISAGE OF



               It's TEENAGERS


               GroSS!


               You're too kind.  Allow me to
               introduce myself.  I am the
               infamous, world-reviled,
               universally despised, IVAN OOZE!


               Well, pack your bags cause we're
               sending you back where you came
               from!


               Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.
               Not much has changed in six
               thousand years.


               we're not just teenagers, raisin-
               head.


               We're the Mighty Morphin Power
               Rangers!

Ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear.


               Ooooh, where's my autoqraph
               book?.

He looks them over reproachfully.


               Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is
               still using a bunch of rug-rats
               to do his dirty work.  And
               speaking of rats...

Ivan raises both hands -- ELECTRICITY SHOOTS OUT HIS FINGERS
and the kids DIVE CLEAR as the bolt ZAPS A THRONG OF RATS.

Now, incredibly, the RATS GROWN INTO GRUNTING, SNARLING MAN



               From this moment forth, the world
               as you know it SHALL CEASE TO


Ivan raises his arms -- thunder CRACKLES and LIGHTNING RIPS





An EXPLOSION OF PURPLE SMOKE CONSUMES IVAN.


               He's  gone. 

The RATS ATTACK!


               Let's take these beasts!!

Tommy gets off a stellar CROSS-HOCK TAKEDOWN, Kimberly delivers
a world class HEEL STOMP, Billy executes a lethal REVERSE
HANDSWORD.  Despite their valiant efforts, the Rangers ar
being overwhelmed by the fierce combatants.



SMOKE POURS from various circuit boards, numerous control
panels VIBRATE.


               Alpha, my sensors tell me the
               Rangers were too late!  Ivan is
               on his way here!


               Hey, NOBODY enters the Command
               Center without a power coin!

There's a BLEET, BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near
the entrance.  Alpha watches, forlorn, as OOZE SEEPS through
the hairline cracks in the door.


               Well...  ALMOST nobody.

The ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR, once again
IVAN RISES UP.  He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings.


               Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I
               guess if you invest your money
               well over SIXTY centuries you can
               buy something pretty nice.

Alpha drops into a Karate stance, makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES
then LUNGES.




Ivan holds his arm out, ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge
Alpha starts spinning.


               Welcome to Wiener World.  May I
               take your order, please?


               You haven't changed, Ooze.
               You're still picking on creatures
               smaller than yourself.

Ivan slowly circles Zordan's column of light, Zordon turns
with him.


               Put a cork in it "Z" .  Ten
               minutes out of the egg and I'm
               already listening to one of your
               lectures.

               

               You robbed me of my PRIME!  I was
               the Supreme Ruler of the most
               foul Empire in the Universe.  I
               was the King of Calamity.  The
               Duke of Destruction.  The big man
               on campus!
                              
               And then you came along.  You
               locked me into your stuffy little
               hyperlock-chamber and tossed me
               into the depths like yesterdays



               It worked for six thousand years.


               Don't remind me!


               Do you have any idea what it's
               like to be cooped up in a rotten
               egg for six thousand years?  It's
               BORING!  Not to mention I've had
               a Charlie horse since the
               Renaissance!  But now the tables
               are turned.  Now...

IVAN raises his hands - he  is holding  a flute and he PLAYS A FEW



               ... it's time to pay the PIPER!

He uses the flute like a lightning rod --  A BOLT OF LIGHTNING



               Oh, the things that I have
               missed.  The BLACK PLAGUE!

He blows up another PANEL.



               The SPANISH INQUISITION!

                         

               The  70's!

HE BLOWS UP ANOTHER PANEL.  Ivan CASTS ANOTHER LIGHTNING BOLT,



               And now, finally, I have the
               strength to DESTROY your pathetic
               powers FOREVER!!





               I've got a NEWS flash for you


Now Ivan begins to THROW LIGHTNING EVERYWHERE, LAYING


Ivan laughs in the b.g.  as Alpha continues to spin,
moving  his arms in and out.


               You put your left probe in, you
               put your left probe out, you put
               your left probe in and you shake
               it all about.  You do the hokey-
               pokey and you turn yourself
               around...




Two rats charge Aisha and she LEAPS UPWARD - the pair SMASH
into each other.

Rocky picks up a two-by-four and starts SPARRING with another
rat.

Billy SHOVES A HUGE WOODEN-SPOOL down a slope and it


One rat CRACKS IT'S TAIL like a whip, KNOCKING Adam to
the ground.

Another rat gets Kimberly in a bear hug and she makes a
face.


               RAT breath!!

She grabs a handful of his whiskers.


               Somebody needs a shave.

She YANKS THEM OUT, the rat SQUEALS and releases her.  The
fight well, but the rats start to get the upperhand.




The Rangers click their power coins into their power morphers.






















They JUMP INTO THE AIR and they're ENGULFED IN A DAZZLING
GOLDEN LIGHT as we do a 3D MOVIE VERSION OF THEIR


They all LAND and there's a WHIRRING SOUND as all six of the
face pieces POLARIZE so we can see their faces.  The rats
immediately scurry off.


               Let's teach these vermin a few
               manners.


               Activating Power Beam!

A YELLOW BEAM SLICES THROUGH THE DARKNESS.  Aisha leads the
group through the site.


               Everybody stay alert.






They pass a bulldozer, some scaffolding


               Hold it...

They come to a stop.

                              ADAM 
               I heard something over there.


               Activating Audio Enhancer!

AN AUTO-PHONIC RECEIVER POPS OUT of the side of Billy's
helmet.  As he turns his head, the receivers ROTATE.

SOUND EFFECT:  We hear silence and then... a RASPY
BREATHING, followed by a GUTTURAL SNARL.


               They're on the other side of that
               wall.

The Rangers advance along a cement wall, slowly round a
corner.  Aisha's light PANS THROUGH THE GLOOM.


               Anybody see them?


               Activating Power Scope!

A SCOPE SNAPS into place over Rocky's left eye.



We see HEAT SENSOR OUTLINES, PULSATING WITH COLOR.  COMMAND


Lines VECTOR and SCAN as Rocky searches the area.  Eventually
he looks up and the lines LOCK ON TO THE PULSATING FORMS  OF





The creatures LEAP DOWN and we see the Rangers pull off  
KICKS, SUCKER PUNCHES, SPINBACK-ROUNDHOUSES, you name it.

One of the beasts TACKLES Tommy and the pair go TUMBLING 
OWN A TWENTY FOOT ROCK PILE.  Aisha picks up a handful of dirt


               Hey, handsome!

A beast turns -- Aisha FLINGS dirt in his eyes.


               My mistake.

She follows through with an OVER SHOULDER THROW --
the beast CRASHES INTO A JOHNNY-ON-THE-SPOT.

Rocky fights another beast and the creature SWINGS
UP THROUGH SCAFFOLDING with phenomenal dexterity.  Rocky goes
after him.




The talking Saber appears in Tommy's hand.

                              SABA 
               What a DREAM I was having!


               We've got company.

Saba sees the rats.


               Rats!  I hate rats!

We hear a PRIMITIVE CRY as a beast SLAMS INTO ADAM,
SENDS HIM CATAPULTING.  Adam rises, speaks in a low growl.


               Bad move, Willard!

He holds his hand in the air.




The STEGA-STINGER appears in Adam`s hand.  He aims
it toward an overhang, FIRES.  A thin wire SHOOTS OUT -- the
Stinger at the end PIERCES the overhang.


               Coming through!

Adam leaps off a platform, SWINGS THROUGH THE AIR like Tarzan,
SLAMS into the rat and sends him CATAPULTING.


               Target Neutralized?


               Raptor-Ribbon!

A contraption APPEARS in Kimberly's hand and she throws her arm
out -- a LONG RIBBON SWIRLS out and tangles itself around the
rat.


               Now you see `em.

She yanks the ribbon pulling the rat into an opening -- he



               Now you don't.

Billy takes a hit, ROLLS across the ground.  He stops inches
away from a twenty foot drop-off.

The beast CHARGES HIM, he ducks and the beast GOES FLYING




               Not the brightest of beasts.

Rocky is now up in the scaffolding.  He DROPS TEN FEET through
the air, LANDS ON ONE END OF A BOARD.

There's a beast at the other end and he goes FLIPPING THROUGH


Tommy throws Saba Saber and the knife SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR
and zings around the beasts as they try to knock him down.


               Na na na na na!

The rats chase after Saba as he heads into a water-slicked
area.  There's a large power cable running across it.  Once 
all the rats are in the water, Saba kamikaze dives into the
cable, SLICING IT OPEN WITH AN ERUPTION OF SPARKS.  The water
SIZZLES WITH ELECTRICITY and the rats GO UP IN A PUFF OF SMOKE.


               Fried mice, anyone?

We see the six original small rats scurry away, SQUEAKING.

Suddenly, there's an EXPLOSION OF ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY and the
Rangers watch, stunned, as their COSTUMES DE-MATERIALIZE and
they appear back in civilian clothes.


               What's going on?!

Billy tries his wrist communicator.


               Alpha, come in!

There's no response.


               We'd better get back.

They all hit their communicators and nothing happens.

                              AISHA 
               Something's wrong!


               Come on, guys...

They hurry off.



The Rangers climb a mountain path, all of them looking alarmed.
Up ahead, there's a PILLAR OF BLACK SMOKE rising from the
Command Center.




The place is trashed -- there's SMOKING debris, ravaged  panels,
exposed wires and mechanisms.  The kids move through the
wreckage in numb silence.

                              TOMMY 
               ... what happened here?...

Adam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble.


               Guys!

The kids quickly uncover the battered robot.


               Alpha, are you okay?!


               I'll GET you my pretty, and your
               little DOG toa!!


               He must've blown an anitromic
               demodulator!

                              KIMBERLY 
               Oh, no...

Everybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions
coming over them.

Laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon.  He is still a
SHIMMERING SPECTRAL being, only now he s aged a good fifty
years.

The kids stand over him, forlorn.


               ... What's happening to him?'


               Outside of his time warp he's
               aging at a vastly acellerated
               rate!


               We have to help him!

Zordon opens his eyes.


               ...  Rangers... thank goodness
               you're safe.

The kids drop down beside him.


               We have to get you back inside
               your time warp.


               I'm afraid that's impossible...
               The power has been destroyed.
               It's gone... The Zords, the
               weapons...  all of it.
                              
               The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers
               are no more.

The kids are stunned.  Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand.


               Zordon... you can't leave us.
               Ever since you came into our
               lives... you've been like another
               father `to  us  all.-


               ... You must be strong... Ivan
               almost overthrew the planet
               once...  and now I'm afraid he
               has the strength to see his
               scheme through.

Zordon closes his eyes.  Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's
shoulder.  The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly
despondent.  Billy turns to Alpha.


               what're we going to do?


               I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham!
               I do not like them, Sam-I-am!

Billy opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment.
Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze.


               Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!!

SPARKS BURST from where his nose should be.  He SNIFFS.


               Thanks, Billy.

Rocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area.


               There has to be something we can
               do.


               Come on, guys, think!

Aisha turns to Alpha.


               Alpha.  Is there any way we can
               defeat this  monster?  Any way at
               all?


               ... Perhaps there is a way... I
               have heard tales of another
               power.


               What?!


               ... They say that somewhere
               beyond the Hyperion Constellation
               there exists a mythological power
               that is beyond all comprehension.


               How can we get to it?


               As the legend goes, the power is
               impossible to obtain.


               We have to try, Alpha.  It's our
               only hope.

Alpha shakes his head.


               It's far too dangerous.  Zordon
               would never allow it.


               If we don't try, Zordon won't
               survive!


               If Ivan  Ooze  isn't  stopped,
               nobody will survive.

Alpha heaves a sigh.


               Ay, yi, yi, yi.
                              
               The legend speaks of a Master
               Warrior who lives on the planet
               Phaedos... This is the only
               person who knows the secrets of
               the power.


               How can we reach Phaedos?

Alpha heaves a SIGH.


               Zordon's going to have my
               orbicular spheroids when he hears
               out about this!

The kids exchange curious looks as Alpha opens a compartment
and removes a vile filled with RADIOLUMINESCENT ENERGY.


               This is an emergency reserve of
               morphonic emissions.  It should
               be enough to get -you there.

He approaches a damaged panel, loads in the vile.


               There is one problem.  I only
               have enough reserve to send you
               Phaedos...  I can't bring you
               back.


               So how do we get back?

Alpha gives them a grim look.


               ... You'll have to pray that the
               legends are true.

Alpha keys in coordinates.


               You're sure you want to do this?!
               The Rangers share purposeful looks.


               It's our only hope.

Alpha shakes his head, punches in the final codes.


               Safe journey, Rangers!

He pulls a lever.




The kids TRANSFORM INTO SIX STREAKS OF COLOR AND BLAST 0FF
THROUGH THE CEILING.  Alpha shakes his head in despair.


               Ay, yi, yi, yi.  They're DOOMED!!

23 thru 27        OMITTED



We see the SIX COLORED STREAKS BLAST away from earth and SHOOT
PAST the moon.

The CAMERA MOVES IN on Zedd's ominous palace which rises up out
of the tortured landscape.  Zedd, Rita, Mordant and Goldar are
standing on the balcony.



Zedd, Rita and their minions are inside Zedd's dark palace
Goldar looks through Rita's telescope as Rita rants.

                              RITA 
               How could he let them slip
               through his hands?!  He's no
               better than the rest of the hired
               help around here!

Goldar looks up from the telescope.


               According to the TX Tracker,
               they're headed for Phaedos.


               I'm gonna fire that slimeball so
               fast his not gonna know what hit
               him!

Ivan sweeps regally into the room.


               Hi, honey, I'm home !


               You garlic-sucking DINGLEBRAIN!
               The Rangers are going after the
               Great Power
                              
               I thought you said this guy was
               the Master of Disaster?
                              
               He's nothing but a slime-
               infested, jelly-bellied blob of --

Ivan SNAPS his hand -- a WAD OF OOZE FLIES OUT, SPLATS RITA
across the mouth, muffling her.


               Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!


               How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up
               Rita but me!


               Sorry, slick, there's been a
               slight'change of plans.
                              
               The "booger man" is taking over.

Ivan drops regally into Zedd's chair.


               Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd
               and lives!

Mordant slips behind Goldar, using him as a shield.


               Zedd's gonna kick this snotball
               into next week!

Zedd SHOOTS A BLAST from his staff -- Ivan is COVERED IN SPARKS.


               Ooooh, that tickles!

Ivan raises his hands and the sparks DISAPPEAR.


               My turn.


He ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE.

Mordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling    
open.  Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!!

Rita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE.


               This is all your fault!  If you'd
               taken me out tonight like you
               were suposed to, none of this
               would've happened.

Ivan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant.


               Now you have a choice, either
               serve me, or join those
               insufferable cheesedongs.

Mordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan.


               We never liked the cheesedongs in
               the first place.


               Couldn''t stand them -- low-class
               all the way.  And did you catch
               a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's
               like having a conversation with
               a couple of ONIONS!  Not to
               mention...

Goldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him.

                              GOLDAR 
               He's just visiting for the
               summer.
                              
               Now what about,the Rangers, oh
               hideous one?


               Ah yes, the RANGERS!!!

He makes a HOARKING SOUND then SPITS OOZE ONTO THE FLOOR,


               Gasunteidt.

Now the OOZE GROWS INTO TEN TENGU WARRIORS -- BIRD-LIKE     


THEY GOBBLE, SQUAWK AND CHIRP like newborn chickens, the
CACOPHONY GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER until...




The Tengu fall dead silent.


               Tengu Warriors, you will fly to
               Phaedos, find the Power
               Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART!

The creatures make HORRENDOUS SQUAWKING SOUNDS AS THEY SPREAD



               Mordant, go with them and report
               back to me!


               You know boss, I'd really like to
               help out but I've got this
               gastronomic condition which rules
               out all space trave--

One of the Tengu grabs hold of Mordant and the FLOCK WINGS OFF







Zedd waves his arms around in outrage.


               Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We
               finally do somebody a good turn
               and just look what happens!


               From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO
               exceptions!

                              RITA 
               It just goes to show, ya never go
               into business with a booger.



The Tengu warriors sweep toward us -- we see Mordant dangling
from one of the Tengu's talons.


               Watch the HAIRRRRRRRR!!

He SWINGS PAST CAMERA and out of sight.

30  thru  32A  OMITTED                                           



The COLORED STREAKS OF LIGHT SHOOT THROUGH THE COSMOS,
heading down toward the planet, PHAEDOS.  It's emerald
green with two radiant golden circles around it.



The STREAKS OF COLOR hit the jungle floor and only FIVE  RANGERS



               Everybody okay?


               Where' s  BILLY? !

The kids search the sky in a panic.





Alpha works frantically hitting buttons and levers.


               Ay, yi, yi, yi!  The filamentary
               transistors have malfunctioned!

SPARKS erupt from the panel, SINGING ALPHA.  He snarls.


               Why you low-frequency, battery
               operated --

Alpha winds up and DELIVERS A MIGHTY KICK to the panel.
suddenly comes to life with BLEEPS and BLIPS.



The Rangers continue scouring the sky as BILLY COMES FLYING.




He SPLASHES DOWN in a puddle.



The others quickly gather around him.


               You okay?


               I think so.

Billy looks down at the puddle.


               This puddle thing is really
               getting on my nerves.

They help Billy up then take in the exotic jungle environment.
They hear all sorts of EXOTIC ANIMAL SOUNDS.


               Welcome to beautiful downtown
               Phaedos.


               ... Incredible...

Tommy gives them all an invigorating look.


               Let's see if we can find this
               Master warrior.

He leads the team down a narrow path.



Establishing.



Ivan is walking through a giant chemical plant with Goldar


               Taking over the world is one
               thing.  It's finding good help to
               run it for you that's the killer.


               You want me to place a few calls?

Ivan shakes his head.


               No need.   I'm going to use the
               young minds of Angel Grove.

GOLDAR digs for buried treasure deep in his nose.


               No offense, boss, but they might
               find you a little disgusting.


               Yes, well, I suppose you'd know
               a little something about that.
                              
               Not to worry.  I'll ever so
               gently lure them in and mold them
               into an army of devils!  And what
               better way to entice them ...
               than with a little Ivan's Ooze?!

Ivan approaches an enormous vat, turns a tap -- it BURPS and
GLOPS as PURPLE OOZE pours out.


               But boss, what about their
               parents?


               Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm
               going to SCOURGE their puny
               minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S.
               And then I'll put them to work
               rebuilding my empire.

Bulk and Skull enter waving a "help wanted" flier.  Both
them are wearing their garish blazers and dark sunglasses.


               I understand you're looking for
               a few new assistants.

Bulk does a G.Q. stance.


               Well put your mind to rest `cause
               now you've got the best.

Ivan doesn't look too pleased.


               What is this?!  I advertised for
               brilliant and good looking
               assistants!

Skull extends his hand.


               Hi, I'm brilliant.

                              BULK 
               And I'm good looking.

Ivan steps forward.


               And I'm Little-Bo-Peep.

Bulk and Skull lower the sunglasses and take a good look
Ivan.  Both of them swallow hard.


               Bulk... why don't we give Mr.
               Peep here a chance to think it
               over?


               A stellar idea, Skull.

They start to back away.


               Not so fast, greaseballs.

Goldar blocks their way.


               You'll have to do.

34   thru   38   OMITTED                                          



The Rangers move through foreboding jungle terrain, their ears
alert to all the UNEARTHLY SOUNDS around them.  Tommy watches
Kimberly, who seems to be lost in thought.


               Hey.

Kimberly glances up.


               You okay?

Kimberly takes a moment to answer.


               I was just thinking about
               Zordon...  everything we've been
               through together.


               You know, meeting Zordon...
               teaming up with you guys, it's
               the best thing that's ever
               happened to me.


               It's the best thing that's ever
               happened to all of us.


               ... He's gonna make it, guys.

The others nod in agreement.


               We'll get this warrior...  save
               Zordon...  and send that
               SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the
               SEWER he crawled out of.

Tommy's words sink in.  He stops suddenly, sensing something.

ANGLE ON - MORDANT hiding behind a tree, watching the Ranger's
pass.

There's a HORRIFIC SCREECH -- the kids look up as the TENGU





It's too late.  The Tengu attack with unbelievable ferocity
They SLASH with their claws, STAB with their beaks and BATTER
with their wings.







Rocky is hurtled into some bushes, Aisha is knocked against a
tree, Adam splashes down in a small creek.  Mordant watches
of this from the sidelines.  He gets so excited that he starts
throwing punches and kicks.




He accidently punches a tree.




One of the Tengu gets Kimberly in a choke-hold,




Tommy rushes to help her and another Tengu trips him -- he
TUMBLES HEAD OVER HEELS DOWN A SLOPE.  We hear an OTHERWORDLY
CRY as a small, hunched figure wearing a tattered robe SWINGS


He proceeds to pull off what is nothing short of a miracle.

He uses the STICKS for weapons as he executes a ROUNDHOUSE
KICK, a SCISSOR-KICK TAKEDOWN, a SITTING SIDE KICK, a
ROUNDHOUSE DROP SPIN BACK KICK, a PARALLEL BLOCK FROM THE
OUTSIDE, a REVERSE HANDSWORD and so on.

The creature punctuates the hits with an exotic variation of



               What's the matter with you
               woodpeckers!  Take this guy out!

The Tengu SQUAWK and SQUEAL as the little dynamo WAILS ON THEM.


               The Tengu Warriors my butt!  The
               Tengu TURKEYS is more like it!

Finally the Tengu retreat, WINGING UP THROUGH THE TREES.


               Hey, aren't you bird-brains
               forgetting something?!

One of the Tengu SWOOPS IN AND SNATCHES Mordant up.


               Watch the meathooks!!

The Rangers recover and exchange expressions of utter disbelief


               Wow!  That was amazing for such
               a little dude!

The figure speaks in a HOARSE WHISPER.


               You're trespassing.
                              
               Now state your business.


               We're looking for the Master
               Warrior.  Do you know where we
               can find him?


               The Master Warrior doesn't
               entertain visitors  -


               But we have to find him.  Our
               leader Zordon is dying.


               Zordon?

Now the most amazing thing happens.  The figure RISES TO FULL
HEIGHT OF SIX FEET, while simultaneously shedding it's robe.

Underneath is a SCANTILY CLAD, STUNNING AMAZONIAN WOMAN.  We're
talking B-U-I-L-T.  Meet the Master warrior, DULCEA.

The Rangers stand there with stunned expressions.  Dulcea looks
to Tommy.


               How did this happen?!

Tommy just gapes.  Kimberly gives him a cold glance and THUNKS
him one with her elbow.


               The lady asked you a question.


               Huh ... Oh, uh, we re, ah...

Kimberly intervenes.


               He was attacked by this horrific
               being -- Ivan Ooze.


               Ivan Ooze is free?!  We are all
               in mortal danger!

She moves off - the Rangers just stand there staring at each
other.


               Let' s go.

The Rangers quickly follow her through the brush Aisha turns
to Kimberly, speaks under her breath.


               Kind of bossy, isn't she?






There's a label with a picture of Ivan -- he's wearing make-up
to make him a little more presentable.

DOZENS OF KIDS Ranging in age from eight to seventeen, are swarming
Bulk and Skull, who have set up a booth with a large banner
that reads:      "FREE OOZE!"

Some kids STRETCH the ooze, others MOLD it, others THROW it at
each other.  It's an ooze free-for-all.


               Boys and girls, girls and boys,
               gather round and feast your eyes.
               This ain't sludge and this ain't
               guck... this is the one and only
               Ivan's Ooze!  Yesireebob.  It's
               ooey, gooey and even kind of
               chewy.  But best of all it's


Bulk and Skull run a booth.   A banner screams "OOZE RULES".      
Kids crowd around.


               Here you go!  No pushing!


               There's enough for everybody!

Fred approaches.


               So where'd this guy come from?

Bulk and Skull exchange apprehensive looks.


               Uh... that's classified, top
               secret, confidential, undercover
               information.


               If we told you -- we'd have to
               kill you.

Fred looks at the container in his hand but he doesn't open it.
Skull sees a kid HURL some ooze at him.




Skull ducks and Bulk gets SPLATTERED in the face.  Bulk glares at
Skull, wipes some goop off, FLICKS it at Skull.


               Come on, come all -- it's an COZE


He smiles, revealing a glistening silver tooth.

40   thru   42   OMITTED



An oriental garden set against a stunning hillside vista.



The kids are seated on rocks by a lakeside, all of them
drinking from clay mugs.  Dulcea finishes handing out bowls.
Aisha stares into hers with a grim expression.


               Is this... food!


               They're called squirbs.

Kimberly lifts out an EEL-LIKE CREATURE, and watches it SQUIRM
between her fingers.


               Mine seems to be a little
               undercooked.

Dulcea sprinkles hers with brown flakes.


               Add a few dried weevils and
               you'll never know the difference.

The other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squirbs over
his mouth and drops it in.  He chews a few times, lets out  a



               ... Not bad.


               Listen, we appreciate your
               hospitality, but we really don't
               have much time.

Dulcea looks to Tommy.


               What do you know of the Great
               Power?


               Only that we need it to defeat
               Ivan Ooze.

Dulcea's eyes move from Ranger to Ranger.


               It is said that to those who
               possess the Power... all things
               are possible.


               Where did it originate?


               In another time, another
               dimension.  It was brought here
               long ago by the "Nathadians", a
               people who are now all but
               extinct.
               They built an impenetrable stone
               Monolith to store the power and
               keep it from their enemies.
                              
               For thousands of years, beings
               from all over the Universe have
               tried to obtain it... ALL have
               perished.

Dulcea's words hang heavily in the air.


               So how can we get to it?


               The only way to obtain the power
               is to achieve the highest state
               of being...


               And how do we do that?


               By learning the ancient art of
               Ninjetti.  It is the Genesis of
               what you on earth have come to
               know as the Ninja.
                              
               It is the perfect union of mind,
               body and spirit.


               Look, Zordon doesn't have much
               longer to live.  And for all we
               know, Angel Grove could already
               be under attack.  We don't have
               TIME for this.

As Rocky is talking, a flubbery looking SNOUT works it's way
over Kimberly's shoulder.  She hasn't noticed it yet.


               You don't understand.  If you do 
               not have the Ninjetti, the power
               will destroy  you.
                              
               To reach the Monolith we must
               traverse the Neola jungle.  We
               will train today, and set out on
               foot tomorrow.

The snout works it's way underneath Kimberly's chin -- she




This is Dulcea's ant-eater like assistant.   He jumps up and
down, YAMMERING and GESTICULATING.






               Snoggle, you watch your language!

Snoggle now re-fills Aisha's tea-cup.


               Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?


               Excuse me?


               Slnughyu buglhugrmrph?


               He wants to know if you'd like a
               cube of sugar in your tea.


               Ah... sure.

We hear a PHOOT as Snoggle BLOWS A CUBE OF SUGAR OUT HIS SNOUT
AND IT SPLASHES INTO AISHA'S TEA.  Aisha stares at the cube a
moment.


               Ah... thanks.

The other Rangers watch as Billy holds one of the squibs above
his mouth and drops it in.  He chews a few times, lets out a



               ... Not bad.



Night has fallen on Angel Grove.  We PAN ACROSS a quiet, middle-
class neighborhood, settle on a two story house.





We PULL BACK to reveal it's sitting on a table.

Mr Kelman enters, looks it over curiously.  He picks it up,
opens it and sticks his finger inside.

Suddenly a CRACKLING ELECTRICAL CURRENT RUNS OVER HIS ENTIRE
BODY.  His face goes blank and his eyes momentarily GLOWS     
PURPLE.  Now he strides purposefully out the door.

43C   thru   47   OMITTED                                         



Dulcea and the Rangers are gathered around a bird-bath stand
with FLAMES leaping out of it.


               In the language of the
               Nathadians, "Nin" stands for
               "man", "jetti" stands for
               "animal".  Ninjetti  - man and
               animal, together as one.
                              
               Now, put your hands inside the
               flame.


               Yeah, right.


               It will not harm you.

The kids hesitate a moment, then reluctantly put their hands
inside the flame.  Aisha makes a horrific expression...


               Just kidding.

They remove their hands -- they're filled with sand.


               Wow.  Sand.


               Now tell me... what do you see?

Aisha studies the sand for a moment -- it MAGICALLY TAKE ON


                              AISHA 
               I see... a bear


               Aisha, you are the Bear, stalwart
               and bold.


               Stylin'!

Dulcea turns to Rocky.  His sand MAGICALLY TAKES ON THE SHAPE



               I see... an Ape.


               Rocky, you are the Mighty Ape.

We see each of them DISCOVER THEIR ANIMAL.


               I see... a fox


               Close.  Billy, you are the Wolf,
               cunning and swift.

And now Kimberly.  She studies hers for a moment.  It looks
like a bird.


               I think its some kind of bird.


               Kimberly, you are the Crane,
               agile and sublime.

Now Adam.


               That's gotta be a frog.


               Adam, you are the Frog, quick as
               lightning.

And finally, Tommy.


               It's... an eagle?


               Look closer.


               ... A falcon?


               Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged
               Lord of the Sky.  

Kimberly regards Dulcea with true admiration.



               How do you know so much about the
               Ninjetti?

Dulcea stands tall and proud.


               I... am the sole living
               descendant of the "Nathadians".
                              
               Now prepare yourselves for the
               most intense physical and mental
               training known to man and animal.




Fred enters the living room and searches for his Dad.


               Dad... ??!

He heaves a frustrated sigh.




Fred enters the empty master bedroom, a look of concern coming
over him.






Fred comes outside as several KIDS approach, all of them
looking forlorn.


               You seen my parents?


               I can't find my dad either.


               What's going on?!

Suddenly a WILD KID wearing grunge clothes runs by HOWLING LIKE
A BANSHEE.  He's holding a container of ooze in one hand and a
baseball bat in the other.  He SMASHES a couple of trash  cans
with his bat.


               Ooze, ooze, ooze rules!!

The kid BASHES IN a mailbox then runs off.  Fred looks
startled.


               That guy was the student body
               President

49   thru   50   OMITTED



Kimberly and Snoggle observe as Dulcea walks ON HER HANDS
across a narrow bamboo log that spans a pond.  A waterfall
churns in the b.g.


               The crane maintains it's agility
               through the perfect harmony of
               mind, body and spirit.

She leaps into the air, does a ROUND-HOUSE KICK, lands
perfectly on the narrow span.


               Awesome!

Dulcea reaches the end of the log, flips through the air lands    
flawlessly on the ground.

Kimberly heaves a sigh, climbs onto the bamboo and start
walking across, balancing precariously on her hands.

She gets about a quarter of the way, loses her balance, and
falls into the shallow pond.

Snoggle laughs, making a loud HONKING SOUND.  Kimberly
recovers, shoots him a look.


               Let's see you do it .

                              SNOGGLE 
               Ghun Phnug Gnouphl.

He marches to the pole, Dulcea holds him back.


               Snoggle, we don't have time for
               you to show off

52   thru   53   OMITTED



Dulcea and Rocky are standing at the bottom of a twenty foot pole
with an exotic oriental carving


               The ape is strong, but more
               importantly it is flexible and
               free.

Dulcea now SCRAMBLES UP THE POLE WITH THE NIMBLENESS OF A
SPIDER.  In less than ten seconds she reaches the top.  Rocky
shakes his head in disbelief.


               Who is this lady?

Now she SLIDES DOWN like a firewoman, drops beside Rocky.  He
takes hold of the pole, focuses for a moment.


               Here goes!

It starts SCURRYING UPWARD.  He gets about fifteen feet in the
air, loses his grip, PLUMMETS AND SLAMS TO THE GROUND.



Dulcea and Billy circle one another, fighting with spinning      
WHISTLING sticks.

Dulcea is blindfolded, Billy isn't.                    


               The wolf relies on it's enhanced
               senses to guide it...  He can
               hear what we cannot hear, he can
               smell what we cannot smell.

Billy takes SWING after SWING -- Dulcea easily DEFLECTS every
blow.

Now Dulcea takes numerous SWINGS, THWACKING Billy repeatedly
and finally KNOCKING him INTO THE WATER.



Dulcea, Adam and Snoggle stand in an area filled with FLYING



               The frog remains still and silent
               while it assesses its target...
               then strikes out in the blink of
               an eye.

We hear a TRILLING SOUND as Dulcea watches some kind of insect
dart around her.

THWAP!  The TRILLING SOUND is gone.  Dulcea has literally
caught the insect in the blink of an eye.  Adam shakes his head
in disbelief.

He waits a moment, hears a TAT-TAT-TAT sound and watches a
insect zip around him.  He lashes out numerous times,
missing the insect completely.

THWUMP!  With lightning speed Snoggle VACUUMS the fly into his
snout.  CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH.

Adam speaks under his breath.


               Show off.



Aisha watches as Dulcea goes into a bear stance.


               The bear is sturdy as a towering
               tree.  Nothing can uproot it.

Snoggle CHARGES Dulcea, SLAMS INTO HER.  She remains as rooted
as a tree.  Snoggle meanwhile suffers some serious bodily
damage.


               Girl, you've got to be kidding
               me.

Snoggle recovers and faces Aisha.  Aisha shrugs, goes into a
bear stance.  Snoggle charges, SLAMS INTO HER and sends HER


54D   thru   54E   OMITTED                                        



Dulcea and Tommy are standing on a towering rock rising out of
a dark lake.


               The falcon never struggles with
               the air, but rather becomes one
               with it.

Now Dulcea does the impossible.  She LEAPS OFF THE ROCK, SOARS
FIFTY FEET through the air, AND LANDS on another protruding
rock.  Tommy is stunned.

                              DULCEA 


Tommy psyches himself up.


               You can do this.  You can do
               this.  You can do this...

He spreads his arms out, LEAPS... and DROPS LIKE A ROCK
exploding into THE BLACK WATER.



Alpha fusses over Zordon, who is looking a good ten years older.


               ... Alpha, I am deeply concerned
               about the Rangers...


               I told them it was too dangerous,
               but they wouldn't listen.


               ... We must try to communicate
               with them.

Alpha looks out over the decimated Command Center.


               Perhaps if I could locate a
               vertical-deflector then I could
               assemble a holographic-comlink.

Zordon shudders in pain, closes his eyes.  Alpha watches over
his mentor, shakes his head in anguish.


               Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi .






Dulcea leads the kids through a circular opening in one
wall, all of them look completely wiped out.  She reaches an
ornate doorway, faces the Rangers.


               Each of you must reach deep
               within and draw upon your natural
               instincts...  Only then will you
               know the way of the Ninjetti.
                              
               Rest for a few hours.  We will
               continue at daybreak.

She heads through the door.


               So where are we supposed to
               sleep?

Snoggle points to the campfire.


               Buhph nghujr.

He pushes Kimberly toward it making a "Na na na na na" sound
through his snout.  He then hurries inside and SLAMS the door.


               That guy's cruisin' for a
               bruisin'.

The kids approach the dying fire, all of them limping a little.


               I can hardly walk...


               I've never been this sore in my
               life.

They drop around the fire, a few of them GROANING.  They stare
into the orange coals for a long moment, all of them looking
disillusioned.


               Do you guys really think we can
               pull this off?

It takes a moment to get a response.


               Maybe if we had more time.


               ... I wonder... We've been
               relying on our Morphin Powers for
               so long... maybe we've forgotten
               how to rely on ourselves.

There's a somber silence.


               We should get some rest.

They all settle in for the night.



A PURPLE HAZE OF SMOKE has settled on the construction site.
Suddenly, mysteriously, SWARMS OF ZOMBIFIED PARENTS emerge from
the vapors - We see Mr. Kelman amongst them.

Ivan steps forward, followed by Goldar.


               Ladies and gentlemen, Simon
               says...  STOP!

All the parents stop.


               Simon says... stand on one foot!

All the parents stand on one foot.  Ivan seems to be taking a
perverse glee in all this.


               Simon says...


               Quack like a'duck!

All the parents start QUACKING LIKE DUCKS.   Ivan slowly turns
to Goldar, gives him an icy stare.


               It just slipped out.

Ivan turns back to the QUACKING parents.




The parents keep quacking.


               You didn't say "Simon says".

                              IVAN 
               Simon says SHUT UP!!!


               Now, as soon as I give the word    
               I want all of you to start
               digging.
                              
               Do I make myself perfectly --

The zombie parents have already started going to work.  Ivan
shakes his head in exasperation.


               This is the Iast time I use
               parents for anything!



The Rangers are fast asleep.  A night wind WHISTLES through the
trees, causing the branches to shiver.

After a moment, there's movement in the bushes.  Suddenly,
amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the

moonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE.

He surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy.  He
stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze.
Billy stirs slightly.

The embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face      
A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame.

There's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and
lands on a rock directly above Tommy.  The bird fixes on Tommy
with its piercing eyes.

We hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS:

Now a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from
Adam.  The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING

Now we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES.  Aisha fidgets in
her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER.

Now, all at once, the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE




Ivan and Goldar patrol the parents who are busy digging.


               Let's pick it up here!  I've got
               a schedule to keep.  In twenty
               four hours the ooze is gonna hit
               the fan!

Goldar suddenly point to the sky.


               Hey, boss!




               What kind of landing was that?!
               These clowns are a menace to the
               sky


               How did you fare?

Mordant waves Ivan off.


               Oh, it couldn't've gone better.
               The Power Rangers didn't know
               what hit them .

The Tengu appear, one of them SQUAWKS and makes grand gestures.


               That's right.  And then we threw
               one of them off a mountain and
               another one into a raqing river!


               So they've been destroyed?

The Tengu SQUAWKS some more.


               "Basically".


               What do you mean "basically"?


               Well... we were about to finish
               them off... when this huge
               monster came out of nowhere!


               Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge.
               But you should've seen the size
               of his STICKS

A pensive look comes over Ivan...


               Did these sticks make a whistling
               sound?


               How'd you know?


               Dulcea!
                              
               That miserable, manipulating
               loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!

To help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground.


               How could you let them get away?!
               If Dulcea leads them to the Great
               Power, everything will be ruined!
               They must be OBLITERATED!

One of the Tengu SCREECHES again.


               What're you talking about?!  It
               wasn't my fault!  You're the
               featherbrains that let them get
               away!

Ivan looks up to the sky.


               I call upon the Powers of
               Darkness to enrich the evil of my
               creatures by tenfold!

LIGHTNING RIPS from the sky and ZAPS THE TENGU, CAUSING THEM TO



               And now the coup de grace, to
               lead my tribe to victorious
               battle!

He shoots a BOLT OF ENERGY AND CREATES THE OUEEN TENGU!  She is
a different color than the rest and her eyes GLOW RED.  Mordant
shakes his head in wonder.


               Where does he come up with this
               stuff?

The Queen spreads her wings and makes the most HORRENDOUS
SCREECH imaginable.


               Queen Tengu, lead-your warriors
               to Phaedos, FEAST YOURSELVES UPON



Once again, the Tengu take to the sky like GIANT BATS.



The morning sun bathes Dulcea's compound in a shimmering golden
light.





Snoggle's snout works it's way toward her making SNORTING


Kimberly bolts awake and SLAMS his snout with her fist.  She
YELPS LIKE A CHILD as he grips the protrusion and JUMPS





All the Rangers spring awake.  As they get out from under their
blankets they're shocked to discover that they're all wearing
Ninjetti costumes with animal symbols on their chest.


               How the heck?!...


               What's going on?!


               I don't believe it!

Dulcea approaches, a wondrous expression on her face.


               You have been visited by the
               animal spirits... they have given
               you their blessing.

The Rangers continue to admire their symbols in silent wonder.







1.  We see Aisha standing on a rock, her whole body flowing in
    a martial art exercise.

2.  Billy and Dulcea continue to fight with whistling sticks.
    Billy is starting to get the hang of it.  He hits Dulcea a few
    times, then she CLOBBERS him.

3.  Kimberly balances along the bamboo log again.  She does a
    FLIP and lands it, however one foot slips off and she struggles
    to maintain her balance.

4.  Tommy stands on the protruding rock again, spreads high
    like a falcon, SOARS THROUGH THE AIR.  He gets about ten feet
    then DROPS INTO THE WATER.

5.  Rocky climbs up the oriental pole -- this time he makes it
    up about FIFTEEN FEET before he slips.  He only drops five
    feet.

6.  Adam stands amidst overhanging trees and goes into his frog
    animal stance, his entire being focused on his actions.

7.  Billy stands off alone practicing with the whistling
    sticks.  The weapons are now a BLURR in his hands.

8.  Kimberly balances along the log, executes a FLIP, lands it
    perfectly, throws her arms up triumphantly.

9.  Adam stands on the lakeshore, cncentrating on a buzzing
    insect.  He strikes out at it, but  just misses it.

10.  Aisha also does something appropriate.



HUNDREDS OF KIDS AND TEENAGERS fill the park, all of them
wearing PURPLE CLOTHES.  They're all dirty and grunged out
They jump around, breaking stuff, sparring with each other
It's total pandemonium.

Suddenly, an ERUPTION OF SMOKE -- and Ivan, disguised as the
wizard, MAGICALLY APPEARS.  The crowd CHEERS, Nuremburg style,
fists raised.





               Thank you!  Please!  You're too
               kind.
                              
               Finally. a little appreciation
               where it's deserved.


               We love you Ivan!


               Right back at ya!-
                              
               Now, WHO MISSES SCHOOL?!



















At the edge, Fred discreetly approaches Bulk and Skull.


               Can I have a word with you guys?
                              
               What's really going on here?!
               Where are everybody's parents?

Bulk and Skull exchange a look.


               Like we said before, that's
               classified, top secret...

Fred decides to be tricky.


               Look, Ivan wants me to go dump a
               load of garbage all over them.


               Well, why didn't you say so?!


               They're at the World Center
               Construction Site.

Fred nods.


               Uh.   OOZE RULES!

He does a ridiculous mock salute.  Bulk and Skull repeat it.




Fred rolls his eyes and hurries away.

56   thru   57A   OMITTED 



Dulcea leads Snoggle and the Rangers up a stone path.  They
approach a bush filled with exotic berries.  All of them start
eating the berries.


               Dulcea... how do you and Zordon
               know each other?


Dulcea reminisces.


               We belonged to an interstellar
               Peace Keeping Force known as the
               "Order of the Meledan".
                              
               Zordon was widely regarded as the
               finest Commander in the Galaxy.
               He was a true Legend... If it
               wasn't for him, the Universe
               would be a very different place                 
               from what it is today.

The kids are overwhelmed by what they're hearing.


               So...  what happened?


               Over time our enemies were
               defeated...  I returned to
               Phaedos, Zordon moved on to
               continue the struggle elsewhere.
                              
               Until you kids showed up, I
               hadn't heard from him for
               centuries.

The Rangers are silent for a moment.


               He was always an inspiration...

Dulcea speaks with grim-visaged intensity.


               This is why I'm taking you to the
               Nathadian Monolith.  That is why
               I'm teaching you the Ninjetti.
                              
               If Zordon dies... then a piece of
               all of us dies... and the force
               of good within the Universe will
               be dealt an irreparable blow.

These words strike deep in the kids.



The bulldozers and earth movers have dug out a twenty foot pit.
IVAN leads Goldar and Mordant through the site, passing dozens
of laboring parents.


               As soon as we've taken over the
               world I'm gonna change my name to
               Sir Mordant.  Or how about MAJOR
               Mordant?!


               How about Major Moron?


               How about the two of you shut Up
               and pay attention!!

The entourage comes to a stop, Goldar and Mordant can't believe
what's before them.


               What is THAT!




               Feast your eyes upon the
               exoskeleton of the barbaric

                              


                              





ANGLE ON FRED as he darts through the construction site, taking
care not to be seen.  He hunkers down behind a stack of
two-by-fours, searches the area.  He spots his dad, speaks under
his breath.


               Dad...?!

He glances around to make sure the coast is clear, then sprints
off to where his dad is digging, grabs his hand.


               We have to get out of here!


               Dig... dig... dig...


               Dad?!... It's me, Fred!

Mr. Kelman just gives Fred a blank stare.


               Dig... dig... dig...

Suddenly an ARM FALLS ON FRED'S SHOULDER.


               Gotchya!

Fred whips araund, finds Mordant standing behind him.     He
SPRINGS TO ACTION pulling off a lightning quick IRON HAMMER
FIST STRIKE, a PALM HEEL BLOCK, A FRONT KICK WITH JUMPING


Mordant is getting pummeled.  The last kick sends him FLYING
BACK INTO THE DIRT.  Fred takes off as Goldar stands over
Mordant.


               Just shut your gap!


               Did I say anything?





Zordon is looking more decrepit than ever.  Alpha inserts
tube into a make-shift electronic contraption.


               By bouncing ultra-high
               frequencies off one of the
               network satellites, I can send a
               long-range pulsar signal to
               within TWO FEET of the Rangers
               coordinates.     


                              
               ... I just pray we're not too
               late.

Alpha continues making adjustments.


               Let's give it a whirl.

He flicks a switch and the screen LIGHTS UP WITH STATIC.  The
the same reporter we saw at the opening of the movie appears.


               Angel Grove Police have been
               fielding hundreds of calls from
               concerned citizens as the number
               of missing gersons continues to
               grow 

There's more STATIC, then IVAN APPEARS AS THE WIZARD.


               Hi, folks, Ivan Ooze here.


               Ai,  yi,  yi,  yi,  yi 

As Ivan speaks we see Mordant behind him waving into camera.


               Are you bored with your work?
               Are you bored with your family
               Are you bored with your 1ife
               Well, come on down to Ooze City
               and LET'S GET STICKY!





The group reaches the crest of a ridge -- off in the background
we can see the outline of the Nathadian Monolith.


               The Monolith is there in the
               distance.

The kids strain to get a better look.


               This is as far as I can take you.

The kids are thrown by this.


               You're leaving us?!


               I have taught you all that I
               know.   Now you must achieve the
               Ninjetti on your own.

The kids share glances, not quite knowing what to say.


               It is said that once you've
               reached the power... you have
               only ten triacs to release it.


               What's a Triac?


               About twenty seconds in your
               time.


               And how do we release the power?


               The legend goes that you release
               the power with the power.


               What does that mean!


               That is a question that even I
               cannot answer.
                              
               Remember, ten triacs.  After that
               something bad will happen.


               Like...how bad?

Dulcea gives them a grim look.


               They say the power will throw off
               a super-heated, radioactive
               fireball, instantly reducing you
               to ash and bits of charred bone.

Aisha nods.


               That's pretty bad.


               Thank you, Dulcea.  For
               everything.      

Dulcea catches her hand and six Rangers put their hands on top
of hers.


               Ka'Alabas tor nartu En'Kata-Tay.
                              
               May your animals watch over you.





The sky above the chemical plant is BOILING WITH DARK CLOUDS.     



The parents have finished assembling the STEEL TOWER -- thick
cables run from the base to the skeletal heads of Hornitor and    
Scorpitron.

We see a group of parents fastening clear plastic pipes to the
skeletal feet -- the pipes are attached to the vat of ooze.

Mordant videotapes Ivan as he struts past a giant mechanical
foot.


               Finally, after centuries of
               waiting, my Ecto-Morphicon
               machines are ready to take on the
               world!

Mordant gets the camera a little too close to Ivan.




Ivan SWATS Mordant and the camera FLIES up through the air and
SMASHES against a wall.


               Oh, man, that was a rental!

ANGLE ON - FRED watching from behind a generator, an alarmed look
on his face.  Ivan steps up onto a platform.


               Mordant... let the ooze flow!

Mordant pulls a lever and the OOZE SLITHERS THROUGH THE 



               Goldar... the roof!

Goldar presses a button and the roof of the plant ROLLS OPEN,



               Looks like a fine day for raising


Ivan holds his arms up to the heavens.









               Bullseye!





               LIFE!!  Give my creatures LIFE!

Mordant admires Ivan.


               This guy is the King!

Now the most amazing thing of all happens...

The SCINTILLATING BEHEMOTHS AWAKE FROM THE DEAD, THEIR EYES AND
MOUTHS OPENING, THEIR ARMS REACHING UPWARD.  The beasts ROAR    


Mordant's HAIR LITERALLY STANDS ON END -- he quickly retreats
behind a drum.

FRED looks on in horror.




All of them turn their attention to Ivan.







The parents just stand there with blank expressions.


               What're you waiting for??...

Goldar taps him on the shoulder and he spins around.


               What!


               You forgot to say 'Simon says."

Ivan shakes his head dismally.



The Rangers crest a hill and Adam, who's in the lead, suddenly
drops down - the others following suit.

They peer over the ridge -- their eyes wide.

Before them, a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing.
The ocean RAGES BELOW.

On top of the island is the Nathadian Monolith.  It's a  mind-
boggling wonder from another time and place.

Between the Rangers and the bridge, the Tengu Warriors are on
patrol.


               Man, these are the last guys I
               wanted to see.


               Whadda we do now?

Kimberly surveys the area.


               That's the only way to the
               Monolith...


               We can take these guys!

Tommy pulls all of them into a huddle.



The Tengu are on full alert.  One of them hears something,
snaps around, there's nothing there.

Another Tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg.  He
SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot, missing the     
creature by inches.

We hear a CAW and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon
circling in the sky above.  The Queen is perched on top of a 20
foot rock face. She looks around hesitantly.

Now the Rangers ATTACK, some of them LUNGING OFF ROCKS, others
BURSTING out of crevices, others coming over the walls.

Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times, then
starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts.

The Queen SHOOTS A LASER BLAST from her eyes -- it EXPLODES
before Tommy.

Kimberly battles another Tengu and the creature forces her back
on to the rickety bridge.

The Queen FIRES ANOTHER BLAST.




Rocky DIVES, knocking Aisha away from the bolt.

Adam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily.


               The frog silently assesses its
               target, then strikes out...

Suddenly the Tengu is HURTLED BACKWARD TEN FEET THROUGH THE
AIR.  We didn't even see Adam move.


               ... in the blink of an eye.

Tommy steps up behind a Tengu.


               Yo, Tweety!

The Tengu turns around and Tommy WHALLOPS HIM WITH A SPINNING-
HEEL KICK.  A Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear
stance.


               The bear is sturdy as a towering
               tree.  Nothing can uproot it.

The Tengu CHARGES LIKE A BULL, SLAMS INTO AISHA.  She holds
fast and the bird EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS.


               Bye, bye birdy.

Kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she
EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe.

She finally drops into a crane stance... then just like Dulcea
she LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR, EXECUTES A BRUTAL SPINNING HELL KICK
and sends the birdman TUMBLING OFF THE BRIDGE.

In a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly
back on the swinging bridge.


               Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird!

Billy swings his sticks, BASHES one of the Tengu in the beak --
the creature EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS!




Tommy reaches the top of a rack.  He sees a Tengu making a


TOWARD EARTH TOGETHER.  They HIT the ground and EXCHANGE BLOWS


Rocky SLAMS another Tengu in the beak, KABLAM  -- the creature
is OBLITERATED.

Tommy LEAPS INTO THE AIR, NAILS two Tengu in the beaks.  They


The Queen shoots another BOLT OF ENERGY --  a rock EXPLODES,
SHOWERING THE KIDS WITH SHRAPNEL.  Aisha turns to Rocky.


               It's up to you.

Rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position.
Incredibly he SCALES THE WALL IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT UP THE
POLE.  HE FLIPS OVER THE TOP and lands right before the Queen
Tengu.  He looks her dead in the eye.


               Polly wanna cracker?

With that, he executes a devastating SPINNING-HEEL KICK and the
Queen BURSTS INTO OBLIVION.




Instantly, the remaining Tengu retreat, SQUAWKING and CAWWING  in
rage.  The kids turn to eaeh other, sharing in a moment of triumph.







We're on top of a high tower overlooking the entire city
There's a BURST OF PURPLE SMOKE -- Ivan, Mordant and Goldar
appear.  Ivan looks out on the city, holds up his arms
theatrically.







HORNITOR APPEARS on the street ROARING like a fiend.  His
enormous foot DROPS DOWN AND CRUSHES A CAR INTO OBLIVION.


               And his trimetallic partner in
               crime... SCORPITRON!!

SCORPITRON APPEARS on the street and BASHES IN THE SIDE OF A








Mordant turns to Ivan and throws his arms up in jubilation.






Zordon, now barely alive, watches as Alpha makes more
adjustments to his contraption.


               That should do it.  we won't be
               able to hear them, but they
               SHOULD be able to hear us.
                              
               Here goes.

There's STATIC and then we see the reporter again.


               ... the Mayor has declared a
               state of emergency and asked that
               the city be immediately
               evacuated.  He has reiterated the
               need for everyone to remain calm.

We see images of PEOPLE SCREAMING THEIR GUTS out as they



               Angel Grove has never before
               known such a crisis and we can
               now only pray for the swift
               arrival of the Power Rangers!


               Ay, yi, yi, yi!

Zordon speaks in a whisper.


               ... Alpha, keep trying!


thru   OMITTED                                                   thru




The kids climb up on top of the rock bluff -- before them is a
huge black Monolith.  There's all sorts of charred bones and
skeletons strewn around it, some of them human, some of them
alien.

They approach the massive block, stand before it in awe struck
silence.  In the middle of the Monolith there's a large circle
with the six animals of the Ninjetti carved into it.


               ... The Nathadian Monolith...

Kimberly looks at all the bones -- instinctively puts her hand
on her animal symbol.


               I guess these guys weren't so
               lucky.

A few of the kids walk around the Monolith, examining it more
closely.


               We've come all this way for a
               rock wall?!


               There should be a way to open it.

Billy &amp;;Tommy latch their hands over the block, searching for
an opening.


               ... Nothing.


               Release the power with the power.

Rocky steps back, THROWS HIS SHOULDER into the Monolith with a
THUMP, winces in pain.


               Not that kind of power.

The kids exchange discouraged looks.


               ... There has to be something
               we're missing.

The kids look crestfallen.


               It can't end like this...

Suddenly a SIZZLE OF ELECTRICITY forms in front of them.


               What NOW!

The kids mouth's fall open as... a HOLOGRAPHIC IMAGE OF
ZORDON'S WITHERED FACE APPEARS.  He speaks in a barely
audible voice.


               Rangers... Ivan has invaded the
               city... time is running out...

Zordon's image FLICKERS a few times then STABILIZES again.


               Each of you are now in possession
               of miraculous skills... but only
               when the six become one will you
               have the strength to harness the
               Great Power.

His IMAGE FLICKERS then FADES AWAY.




Billy studies the circle with zealous eyes.


               Six become one... the combined
               forces of the Ninjetti.


               Strength in numbers!!

They silently assemble in a line, all of them interlock:
hands.  They face the Monolith with fire in their eyes.


               I am the wolf, cunning and swift!


               I am the crane, agile and
               sublime!


               I am the bear, stalwart and bold!


               I am the frog, quick as
               lightning!


               I am the mighty ape!


               And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord
               of the Sky!




A mysterious HALO OF LIGHT SHROUDS the Rangers and they dissapear






The kids BURST THROUGH A WALL OF LIGHT and come down together
inside a vast cavern.  There's a pyramid shaped steel object in
the center of the room, a RADIANT LIGHT SHINING FROM IT.


               What HAPPENED?!


               Where are we?!


               Of course!  The power is of
               another world.  Another
               dimension.






               That's twenty seconds!!

The kids advance toward the pyramid.


               Release the power WITH the power.


               What does that mean?!

Adam notices their symbols are glowing.


               Our SYMBOLS.

The kids ogle the radiant emblems.  Kimberly takes hold of hers
and it COMES OFF in her hand -- there's a mirror on the other
side.


               Ten seconds and counting!!


               It's some kind of mirror!

Kimberly looks at her reflection and primps her hair.  The
other's remove their symbols.


               Release the power with the
               power.


               I've got it!  We use the mirrors
               to reflect the light back into
               itself!!







All of them turn their mirrors toward the pyramid.  A BEAM OF



We hear a RUMBLING SOUND as the earth starts to SHAKE.  The
Rangers look to each other, horrified.

Then everything falls still and silent... and then a miracle
happens.

We hear a HARMONIOUS, OTHERWORLDLY CHORUS as the pyramid OPENS



The kids shield their eyes from the brilliance, all of them
wearing wonder-struck expressions.



THEM!  Their visors are clear so we can see their faces.




Now the symbols in their hands TRANSFORM INTO...
















They hit their communicators -- they instantly TRANSFORM INTO




Dulcea and Snoggle watch as the COLUMNS OF COLOR streak away
from the planet, leaving behind a RAINBOW with the six colors
of the Power Rangers.


               Spherhlegnu.


               Yes, Snoggle... they now have the
               Great Power of the Ninjetti!



We see the mass of parents as they march intently down a dark
city street.



Ernie's is packed with crazed kids and teenagers who are
ripping the place apart.

Bulk and Skull watch while gorging themselves on pizza.


               There goes the neighborhood.


               A real shame.

Suddenly Fred appears and shouts out.




The place falls silent.


               You've been brainwashed!  This
               Ivan is no Wizard.  He's some
               kind of DEMON!


               Shut up, squirt.


               You can't talk that way about our
               leader.

Enraged, they move in on Fred.


               You gotta believe me -- he's


The crowd gets angrier.  They move closer... Fred gulps with
fear... glancing around for help, he notices a HOSE.  He lunges
for it, cranks on the water, and TURNS IT ON THE CROWD!
SPLASH!  They get SPRAYED DOWN!

Suddenly -- they stop in their tracks, slowly blinking,
confused.  The spell is broken.  We hear: "What's going on ?!"
"What am I doing here?!", etc.


               Listen to me!  Our parents are in
               danger!  If we don't help them
               they're going to be killed!

He hurries off.  A few follow him, then a few more... until
pretty soon everybody joins him.  Bulk and Skull share a look.



               What about the pizza?

Bulk considers the dilemma.


               We could take it with us.

Skull nods, relieved.  They gather up the pizza and move off
after the others.





The Rangers MATERIALIZE in the Command Center with their
helmets off.




Alpha approaches, speaks in an anguished voice.


               Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too
               late.


               What?!


               Zordon...  he's gone.

The Rangers are too stunned to speak.  They approach Zordon's
lifeless form looking absolutely devastated.


               ... This can't be...

They stare at Zordon with gut-wrenching expressions.  They're
utterly defeated.

Eventually, Tommy looks to the others and speaks in a fervent
voice.


               "To those who possess the Great
               Power...   all things are
               possible."

The kids gradually exchange zealous looks.  They form a circle
around Zordon and interlock hands.

They close their eyes, bow their heads...

After a long moment, a SHIMMERING ENERGY BEGINS TO FLOW DOWN


Zordon grows BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER and then there's a DAZZLING,


When the LIGHT FADES WE SEE THE COMMAND CENTER BACK IN ITS


Zordon's youthful face once again looks down from within his
pillar of light, his eyes filled with a fierce pride.





               Welcome back, kids.


               It's good to be back.

Alpha jumps up and down like a child.





               We thought you...


               It's good to see you again, too.

Alpha sees the Ecto-Morphicon machines on the VIEWING GLOBE.


               AI, YI, YI, YI, YI   Ivan s Ecto-
               Morphicon machines are leveling
               the city!


               We've got news for you, Ivan...


               The Power Rangers are BACK IN


They TELEPORT out.



CLOSE ON IVAN as he TURNS INTO CAMERA, a startled look on his face.





He looks down on the street as the COLUMNS OF LIGHT SHOOT DOWN



                              




The Rangers watch as Hornitor and Scorpitron come THUNDERING
down the street toward them.


               What're THOSE?!

We hear Alpha on Tommy's wrist communicator.


               Rangers, call for your new animal
               Zords!


               Let's DO it!

One after another they click their new coins into their
morphers and go into their stances.



















From the sky, the six new ANIMAL ZORDS BURST FORTH LIKE
THUNDERING, MECHANICAL GODS.  The Rangers look up at the
TOWERING ASSAULT VEHICLES in awe.



We see VARIOUS SHOTS of the Rangers DROPPING INTO their
respective cockpits.



Fred, Bulk and Skull watch a sleek monorail pulling in.  Skull
talks with a mouth full of pizza.


               Look, kid, I don't think you
               realize who you're dealing with.


               I don't think he realizes who
               HE'S dealing with.

The train glides to a complete stop and the doors SLIDE OPEN .




The youngsters pile through the doors, quickly filling up the
entire monorail.



The parents round a corner, advance down the street like machines.



ATTACK WITH A RELENTLESS FEROCITY.  There's all kinds of
CRASHING and BASHING and EXPLOSIONS!

There's a BLAM, BLAM, BLAM as Scorpitron REPEATEDLY FIRES his
cannon arm at the Bear Zord, who in turn DEFLECTS THE VOLLEYS.

Hornitor shoots a BLAST from it's stinger, the Crane Zord
dodges the FIERY ERUPTION.


               Nice try,  Pinhead!

Scorpitron repeatedly KICKS at the Frog Zord with it's BLADED
FEET, SENDING UP OSCILLATORY DISCHARGES, at the same time



               Somebody back me up, here!

Hornitor BORES IT'S DRILL ARM INTO THE APE ZORD, SENDING



               These things are FEROCIOUS!

The Bear Zord CHARGES HORNITOR and the two Mastodons go



               The bear kicks butt!

Hornitor SEARS the Wolf Zord with it's needle-nose.  In
retaliation, the Wolf Zord POUNCES, KNOCKING HORNITOR INTO THE
STREET.  Now the Falcon Zord SWOOPS THROUGH THE AIR.


               Heads up!

He FIRES BOOSTER ROCKETS, STRAFING SCORPITRON WITH AN INTENSE


Hornitor gets back up -- the Ape Zord SWINGS DOWN FROM



               Hope you've got a good mechanic.

Scorpitron FIRES A VOLLEY at the Frog Zord -- the Zord BOUNDS



The Falcon Zord swoops in and blasts Scorpitron who BLOWS UP






                              
               These brats are ruining


Mordant and Goldar watch popeyed as IVAN'S BODY STRETCHES OUT


He STRETCHES and STRETCHES until his head BURSTS THROUGH THE


We hear a resounding SNAP AS IVAN'S FEET ARE RELEASED FROM THE


Now there's all sorts of GURGLING and SLURPING sounds as the
monster's face SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO IVAN'S FACE!

He grins, revealing his silver tooth.


               Let's TANGO!


               We need Ninja MEGAZORD POWER,


There's amazing PYROTECHNICS AS FIVE ANIMAL ZORDS MERGE




As Alpha watches the battle on the viewing globe, he does
little jig.


                GO, Rangers!  GO, Rangers!  GO,
                Rangers!  GO!



The Rangers are side by side, each of them handling different
controls.







There's plenty of GRINDING and SCRAPING as the MEGAZORD RISES



               All systems go!


               This guy is messing with the
               wrong teenagers!

The behemoths CHARGE each other and the mother of all battles
begins.



The parents continue to advance through the city like robots.





The battle continues.  Remarkably, these enormous machines pull
off DOUBLE PUNCHES, DROP KICKS, ROUNDHOUSE HOOKS, SPINBACK





BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM -- The Megazord STRAFES Ivan/Scorpitron
with EXPLODING MISSILES.


               Don't make me LAUGH!

Ivan/Scorpitron SINGES the Megazord with a DEVASTATING LASER





The Falcon Zord SWOOPS IN, STRAFING Ivan/Scorpitron with
gunfire.  Ivan/Scorpitron now turns to Angel Grove Tower and
grabs hold of it.



Mordant grabs on to Goldar.


               I'm outta here.


               Wait for me!

Goldar TAKES FLIGHT with Mordant CLINGING DESPERATELY TO ONE OF














Ivan/Scorpitron RIPS THE TOWER OUT AND USES IT AS A SWORD TO





The giant SWINGS THE TOWER, BATTERING THE MEGAZORD MERCILESSLY.




The POWER SWORD DROPS FROM THE HEAVENS, PIERCES THE GROUND.
Megazord grips the handle, raises it to the sky.




The sword is STRUCK BY THUNDERBOLTS and now the behemoths SLASH
and PARRY WITH CATACLYSMIC BURSTS OF SPARKS.

Ivan/Scorpitron takes a swing and the TOWER SMASHES INTO


Ivan/Scorpitron continues backing the Megazord toward an
enormous power station.


               Time to recharge your batteries,
               FLOWER Rangers!

He takes a final, DEVASTATING BLOW, SENDS MEGAZORD HURTLING


There's an APOCALYPTIC FIREWORKS DISPLAY AS TEN MILLION VOLTS




The kids are SHOWERED WITH SPARKS  - ELECTRICAL TENTACLES SPLAY









Rolls clear, SMOKE AND SPARKS SPITTING FROM ITS JOINTS.














He HURTLES THE MEGAZORD INTO A BUILDING with a sign that
"Angel Grove First National Bank".  The ENTIRE SIDE OF THE



               One more blow like that and we're




Speeds around a bend.



Looks on in shock at the huge rupture in the tracks ahead.




He YANKS the emergency cord.  It doesn't work!



The train heads for the jagged edge of the broken track.



Tommy throws his collective forward.


               The monorail is in trouble! I'm
               going in!



has almost reached the rupture.  Suddenly the Falcon Zord


The monorail miraculously SLIDES across the back of the zord
and continues down the tracks.



Fred, Bulk, Skull and the hundreds of kids CHEER WILDLY.
We hear: "Right on!", "All right Power Rangers!", "Awesome!"



climbs up a ten story building like a mechanical King Kong.



The kids watch as Ivan reaches the top of the building, gazes
up at the stormy skies.


               What's he doing?!

There's more SLURPING and BUBBLING AS HIDEOUS, BAT-LIKE WINGS


The wings FAN OUT and Ivan/Colossus DIVES INTO THE AIR AND



               Let's go after him!!




               Ultra Ninja Megazord complete!



The Falcon Zord SWOOPS down and latches on to the back of the
Megazord.  Now the Megazord GLOWS WITH A TRANSCENDENTAL
LUMINESCENCE and GLORIOUS WINGS SPREAD OUT FROM IT'S BACK.



Tommy DROPS INTO a seat beside the other Rangers.


               I'm in!




Billy throws a switch.



The Megazord TAKES TO THE AIR with the grace of an Eagle.



Fred, Bulk, Skull and the entourage of kids come rushing toward
the construction site.  They can see the parents heading toward
the drop off.


               There they are!


               They're heading for the cliff!


               That's gotta be an eighty foot
               drop!


               Whadda we do?!

Fred thinks for a moment, his eyes settling on a large tanker
truck.






Billy fixes on a screen.


               We've got him locked!


               Speed?


               1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!


               Everybody hold on tight.  We're
               gonna send this sucker into











Zedd and Rita are now half-buried in snow, both of them blue in
the face.  As usual, Rita is ranting away.


               You call yourself a hell-hound?!
               A basset hound is more like it.
               If you were a real outlaw you
               would've gotten me out of this
               blizzard HOURS ago!

Zedd shakes his head in misery.


               This is the last time I marry a
               witch.

Zedd and Rita react as they see Ivan/Colossus and Megazord
shooting out into the stars.


               It's Ivan and the Megazord!!



The two behemoths HURTLE THROUGH SPACE while POUNDING, SLASHING
and RIPPING at each other.


               NOTHING can defeat the Powers of
               Darkness!

Now Ivan/Colossus goes to town on Megazord.  WHOMP!  THWACK!
CRUNCH!  He SMASHES the machine mercilessly.



The cockpit fills with smoke, SPARKS erupt from panels,







Ivan/Colossus BASHES the Megazord so hard that the machine does
MULTIPLE CARTWHEELS through the cosmos.

Ivan/Colossus makes a KAMIKAZE-DIVE straight for Megazord




He BASHES the Megazord, SENDS IT SPIRALING.



FLAMES ERUPT in the cockpit  - everything SHAKES and RATTLES


               He's on us!!


               Wait a second...  What time is
               it?


               Two thirty three a.m.


               Ryan's Comet!!


               What about it?

Biily punches information into a keyboard.


               It's passing over earth as we
               speak!
                              
               Trajectory coordinates are



               Billy, that's BRILLIANT!




               We get Ivan into the Comets PATH--


               -- and KABOOOM -- he's space
               dust!



Fred is standing beside the water truck holding a large hose
Bulk and Skull are in the truck cabin trying to start the
engine.  It turns over but it won't catch.


               Come on!  Come on!

The parents are now five feet from the drop off.
Bulk turns the key again and the engine starts up.


               All right!

He LETS IT RIP -- A POWERFUL JET OF WATER ARCS THROUGH THE AIR


They're about a foot away from the drop when they come to a
standstill, all of them sharing confused looks.

There's all sorts of CHEERS as parents and kids are reunited.
Fred runs into his father's arms.




Bulk turns to Skull, holds out his arms.







They embrace -- Skull practically gets crushed by his burly
friend.






Zedd and Rita continue watching the battle from the snow globe.


               I hope those Rangers put that
               lousy lowlife out of his misery!






Ivan/Colossus SLAMS into Megazord again and the pair go


Ivan/Colossus gets the Megazord into a lethal bear hug.


               Have you hugged your Zord today?

















All the Rangers go to work.


thru   OMITTED                                                   thru




Ivan/Colossus continues to SQUEEZE Megazord.  We hear           
SCREECHING METAL and BURSTING VALVES.



Alpha and Zordon watch as Ivan/Colossus bear hugs Megazord.


               Ay, yi, yi!  The Rangers are
               going to be CRUSHED!


               Don't lose hope yet, Alpha!










We see a BRILLIANT COMET BLAZING straight toward us!









Ivan/Colossus continues to SQUEEZE Megazord, oblivious to the
COMET BOMBING TOWARD HIM.  Megazord struggles fiercely to break
free.










               Desperate times call for
               desperate measures.

Aisha opens a metal switch cover.


               What're you doing?!

Inside is a red switch with a sign: "FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY"


               Taking care of business.

She flicks the switch.



Ivan/Colossus is about to CRUSH Megazord into oblivion whEn
Megazord's KNEE SUDDENLY RISES WITH LIGHTNING SPEED AND KICKS


Ivan/Colossus releases Megazord and DOUBLES OVER IN PAIN.







               Bull's eye!









Megazord WINGS OUT OF THE WAY as the COMET BLASTS STRAIGHT TOWARD


In the last second, he see the HURTLING ORB.




Now we witness the EXPLOSION TO END ALL EXPLOSIONS as
Ivan/Colossus is TRANSFORMED INTO A BILLION FLAMING PARTS





The Rangers all throw their hands up in triumph.







Alpha LEAPS for joy.







Rita and Zedd both look immensely pleased.


               That was a CHEAP shot!


               We couldn't have done it better
               ourselves.

KAPOW -- Zedd and Rita APPEAR BACK IN ZEDD'S PALACE IN ORIGINAL
SIZE, both of them still covered in snow.



The Rangers are gathered around Zordon, holding their helmets
in their hands.


               Rangers, by going after the Great
               Power, all of you knowingly put
               your lives at extreme risk... and
               in so doing you not only saved my
               life, you saved all of Angel
               Grove and the world from a reign
               of unthinkable terror.

The Rangers literally beam.  Alpha holds up a camera.


               Everybody say cheese.

The kids share amused looks and all together they LEAP IN THE









Rita and Zedd chase Mordant and Goldar around the palac
BLASTING them with their staffs.


               What'd we do?!


               It's not what you DID, it's what
               you DIDN'T do!


               We tried to rescue you every
               chance we had!




She WHACKS Goldar.


               Ouch!!


               Do you know what it's like to be
               stuck in a BLIZZARD FOR TWO



               ... Cold?


               Are you trying to be funny?!

Zedd BLASTS Mordant, SINGING his hairy behind.


               Hey, watch the hair!!!
