                                                       Shooting script
                                                      March 15th, 2004









     CLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET


     ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of
     control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.

     It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN
     THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.





     THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and
     FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.

     POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in
     a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...

     The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the
     bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand
     holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to
     his body. His left holds a GUN!

     Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE


     A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to
     burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the
     camera...


                ... Police on scene are approaching
                the suspect. They're at the center of
                the Bridge now.

     The Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives.     The
     Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT!



     SUDDENLY...   THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING






                We have shots fired. Shots have been
                fired... Both the suspect and his
                hostage are down... Police are moving
                in... Oh my God.





     A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS,
     HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not
     watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND
     TONIC, is...

     DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His
     charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much
     trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood.
     The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.

     IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE:
     most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)


                After a two month investigation, Det.
                Jason York has been relieved of duty
                for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge
                shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John
                Curtis. Key testimony against York
                came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was
                on scene that night. The Seattle
                Police Department is handing this case
                over to the King County District
                Attorney's office. Criminal charges
                are expected.



     The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN
     MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.


                In a civilized society, the men and
                women entrusted with serving and
                protecting the community are to be held
                accountable just like everyone else.
                Simply put... Just because you are a
                cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to
                you. This is no longer the wild, wild
                west.



     KAREN CROSS stands on the steps, a PHOTO of Conners appears.





                This same review board last week found
                Quentin Conners, Det. York's partner,
                "not responsible" for the same
                shooting. He remains on suspension
                without pay.



     Conners turns off the TV, lays the remote next to a PHOTO of
     Conners and a YOUNG WOMAN  during happy times. He
     stares at the photo, finishes his drink.







     A COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms
     in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While
     the sun shines now, the OVERCAST SKY on the horizon
     FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city...



     An IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC,
     street and pedestrian, go about their business.

     ACROSS THE STREET...   A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop.



     LORENZ, 40's, sits behind the steering wheel. His EYES cold,
     merciless. He's joined by FOUR OTHER MEN, ALL BLACK CLAD -
     HEAVILY ARMED with BODY ARMOR!

     Lorenz stares out at the bank, a last moment of peace.
     Simultaneously, ALL FOUR DOORS OPEN and...



     Lorenz and the Black Clad exit, quickly cross the street,
     heading for the bank! Each carries a LARGE BLACK BAG.



     PATRONS in line, wait impatiently. A SECURITY GUARD in the
     corner yawns. TELLERS count out cash, access accounts on


     GRAINY SECURITY CAMERA IMAGES depict an average, business
     day. THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM.






     Lorenz and the Black Clad arrive at the doors.     They RAISE
     THEIR MASKS and...



     Off the CROOKED EYEBROW of a BANK TELLER...



     The BLACK CLAD STORM THE BANK! Four of the Black Clad move
     into position. Lorenz stands center stage. Gun in hand, he
     aims at the ceiling, PULLS the trigger... BAM! A GUNSHOT



                Drop to the floor! Slowly! No sudden
                moves!
                    
                You! Hands on heads, drop to your
                knees. Now! Do it!

     PATRONS and TELLERS HIT THE GROUND, TERRIFIED!     Lorenz is in
     COMPLETE and UTTER CONTROL.

     BLACK CLAD #4 and #3 keep watch on the tellers behind the
     counters! One on one side, one on the other.

     BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points
     them into the lobby!

     BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd
     level, forces them downstairs.

     From the corner of Lorenz's eye...      The SECURITY GUARD's hand
     creeps toward his gun.


                That... you don't want to do.

     The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS
     the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard
     drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.

     Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to
     Black Clad #2!


                Y'all picked the wrong day not to use
                the ATM.
                    
                You will not be harmed if you do
                exactly what I say, when I say it. You




                           LORENZ 
                 take your chances if you choose not to
                 listen.

      BLACK CLAD #2, keys in hand, flies across the counter,
      carrying a large duffel bag... Heading to the vaults!


                 No one will say I didn't give you a
                 choice.



      Black Clad #2 arrives, drops his bag, unzipping...


                     
                 I'm in.



      Lorenz gets the message, finds THE BANK MANAGER cowering
      behind his desk.


                 You, up.
                     
                 You understood what I just said?


                 Yes.


                 Your security system, you can
                 electronically lock all entrances...


                 Yes.   Right-right away.


                 With that attitude, you and I are going
                 to get along famously. Now go.

      The Bank Manager nods nervously.

      BLACK CLAD #4 holds open his bag. He strides by the
      CUSTOMERS who deposit CELLPHONES, PAGERS, inside.



      The Bank Manager taps on his computer keyboard.


                 It's done.     We're locked down.




      Lorenz nods.



      BLACK CLAD #1 flips the "BANK CLOSED" sign around.



      Jenkins fastens his cufflinks.   In the bed behind him...

      HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon
      with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around
      her.


                 Have you seen my watch?

      Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the
      watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't
      love, this is a relationship of convenience.

      Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one
      last check in the mirror...


                 This was fun. You should get out of
                 bed. You'll be late for work.

      And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to
      close, then collapses back onto the bed.



      PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety
      deposit boxes together! BLACK CLAD #2, takes cover, readies
      the detonation device and...


                     
                 Fire in the hole.

      He FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM!    AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH




      A PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands
      UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected.



      An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment.    He reaches up and





      BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his
      weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS
      profusely from his neck, not dead yet.

      Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.


                 What do you think you're doing?


                 Fucker pushed the alarm.

      Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.


                 It would've made more sense to shoot
                 him before he pushes the fucking alarm.
                 Not after.
                     
                 Jesus.

      Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's
      head and...


                 And... If you're going to do something.
                     
                 Do it right.

      The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead.    Lorenz checks
      his watch... 9:26 a.m.


                     
                 Alarm's tripped. We're on a clock.
                     
                 Get these people out of the way.



      The Four Seasons it ain't.



      There's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel
      clean. Doubt and fear present on her face. She turns off
      the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off
      screen, chimes!



      Teddy, a towel wrapped around her, picks up the pager.   The
      number: 911. She picks up the TELEPHONE, dials.





                     
                 This is Detective Galloway.



      SIRENS BLARE... POLICE CARS brake hard, blocking traffic.
      OFFICERS fly out, shotguns out!

      HELICOPTERS circle. NEWS VANS speed onto the scene as the
      CROWDS builds. Standing in the center of things...

      DETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not
      a popular member of the force. TWO OFFICERS, 30's, follow
      him.


                     
                 I want all points of entry identified
                 and covered. We need SWAT here now.
                 Have emergency crews standing by!


                     
                 Didn't take them long.


                 Set a perimeter.    Move'em back.


                 How far?


                 Portland.



      A phone cord is YANKED from the wall!

      Black Clad #1 and #4 push Customers and Employees inside!
      They door SLAMS SHUT.



      POV OF LORENZ - Callo approaches the Tech Van.

      Lorenz peeks through the curtains.       A phone pressed between
      his shoulder and ear.

      He places a VOICE MODULATOR over the phone's mouthpiece (this
      will leave his voice sounding LIFELESS and DISTORTED to those
      on the receiving end).








     Callo arrives at the POLICE TECH VAN.    So state-of-the-art
     NASA is green with envy.

     BRENDAN DAX, 30's, the techno-wizard, with headphones on,
     hands Callo a phone. Several other OFFICERS listen in.


                We have them on the line.

     Dax presses a series of buttons.


                We're hot.


                    
                This is Detective Callo, Seattle P.D.
                Who am I speaking with?


                No questions. It's time to set the
                rules. I am in complete control of
                this facility. No one gets in or out
                without my say and I will execute every
                last man, woman and child in here if my
                needs are not met. Do not test me.
                Today, I am a man of zero patience.


                I'm listening.


                See if you can't screw this up,
                Detective... I have but one demand.
                One and only demand.





     Conners wears a T-shirt and some sweats, opens his
     refrigerator, grabs a bottle of water. When he closes the
     door... He notices Jenkins and a YOUNG DETECTIVE on his
     deck.

     Conners crosses, opens the door for Jenkins and DETECTIVE
     SHANE DEKKER, late-20s. Dekker's all business when it comes
     to being a cop. Green, but eager to prove himself. After a
     long beat...


                Do you have a warrant?





          I need to speak to you, Quentin.


          There's where your shit out of luck
          because I don't need to speak to you.


          It's important.

Conners and Jenkins trade serious stares. Conners finally
relents. Jenkins and Dekker enter. Dekker notices - THE



          Quentin, this is Detective Shane Dekker.


          Huh? You don't look like much of a
          Detective.


          Funny. I was going to say the same
          about you.


          Charming.


          Shane just transferred in from Tacoma.      His
          father...


          Save your breath. I really don't care.

Before Jenkins can respond, from the bedroom, a TALL, BLOND
WOMAN, 20s, emerges, COMPLETELY NUDE.

The men WATCH as the Woman, PAYING THEM NO ATTENTION,
retrieves a bottle of water from the fridge, then returns to
the bedroom. No words spoken at all. After the moment has
passed...


          Why don't we can the chit-chat.    Get to
          what's on your mind.


          We've got a hostage situation, American
          National Bank. The sonsabitches said
          they wouldn't talk to anyone but you.


          No shit?





          No shit.   I need you to do this.


          Why should I?


          Because people's lives are at stake.
          That takes priority over your ego.


              
          You may want to put a leash on him.
              
          Saying I did want to help... I'm still
          suspended or did that slip your mind?


          The commissioner's office has ordered
          me to reinstate you. As of now, you're
          back on the force.


          Just like that?


          Just like that.
              
          I won't, however, unleash you alone.


          Always a catch.


          Shane, here, is your new partner.
          Consider him a younger version of me,
          looking over your shoulder, watching
          every move you make.

The idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners.


          Don't think I endorse this. If it were
          my call, you'd be with your partner...


          You mean ex-partner.


          ... On the unemployment line with him.


          For a moment there, I thought you
          cared.





                I care about those innocent people down
                there. I hope to God someone hasn't
                made a monumental mistake letting you
                back in.


                I appreciate the words of encouragement
                and the confidence you have in me. I
                look forward to the continuing,
                positive relationship we've shared in
                the past.













     POLICE CORRAL the ever-growing group of SPECTATORS.

     A SWAT TRUCK pulls up, the BACK DOORS FLY OPEN!     SWAT exit in
     a flurry, race into position.

     Amidst the commotion... JENKINS' CAR navigates the scene,
     stops next to... KAREN CROSS immediately recognizes Conners,
     orders her CAMERAMAN to center on him.

     Conners, Dekker and Jenkins climb out of the car, head
     towards the crime scene, when...


                Detective Conners? Detective, can we
                have a few words?

     Conners turns, recognizes Karen.    Relishing the moment...


                I'll give you two...
                    
                Blow me. If you need a follow-up
                comment let me know?
                    
                Cunt made her career off me.






Conners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair
still wet, with her partner, DET. VINCENT DURANO, 40's, a
middle of the road, never out on a limb type cop.

Callo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him.


          Teddy, Vincent...
              
          ... Nice to see you both.


          Conners has been reinstated to full
          active duty. It's his scene.

This info comes as a surprise.   Especially to Callo.


          The last hostage situation this guy
          headed, an innocent civilian died.


          I was not responsible...


          You never are. That girl would be
          alive today if it weren't for your
          cowboy antics. You destroy lives.


          Fuck you. Look who's talking about
          destroying lives.


          Decision's been made, Bernie.


          I was first on scene and I have seniority.
              
          Don't do this, Martin.


          We'll talk about it later.   Take a hike.


              
          Fine. I'll watch this train wreck from
          home.

Callo exits.


              
          I'm going to miss him.





                SWAT, because of the special
                circumstances will defer to Conners.
                He's in charge.


                First time I've heard SWAT defer to
                anyone.


                    
                Second chances don't come around often.
                Don't blow it.

     Jenkins skeptically eyes Conners before stepping away.     He
     motions for Dekker to walk with him.


                Anything questionable happens today,
                you let me know.


                Yes, Captain.

     Out of earshot, Conners watches Dekker and Jenkins.


                Looks like you got yourself a baby-
                sitter.

     Conners glares at Teddy out the corner of his eye, then
     dismisses the comment.





     More SPECTATORS, more MEDIA.

     Conners, Dekker, Teddy and Vincent hover behind the first
     barricade. Conners unwraps gum, sticks it in his mouth.


                We have approximately four to seven,
                heavily armed men holding an
                unspecified number of customers and
                employees hostage.


                You're just a wealth of knowledge,
                aren't you?





                Witnesses heard shots fired and some
                kind of explosion. And their only
                demand has been to speak with you.


                I'm sure it won't be the last. Get me
                a line into the bank. Let's see what
                they really want.







     Lorenz enters, shuts the door and REMOVES HIS MASK.    He lets
     a few rings pass, before ANSWERING.


                    
                Detective Conners?





     Conners and company gather outside of the Police Tech Van.
     Dekker pulls a pad and a pen, prepares to take notes.

     Dax sits, headphones donned, records the entire conversation.


                Who am I speaking with?


                For now...     You can call me Lorenz.

     Dekker writes, "Lorenz."


                Okay, Lorenz, how are we doing in there?
                Can we get you anything? Food, medical
                supplies. We heard an explosion.


                Everyone who matters is fine. Of course,
                I would've preferred not having the
                authorities involved at all. We weren't
                planning to be here this long. But, since
                Seattle's finest needs a presence on the
                scene, I'm glad it's you.





          My fame proceeds me.


          Don't be flattered. I needed someone
          who's been through the experience
          before. Hopefully this time it will go
          better for all involved. I plan on
          living a full, long and rich life. I
          didn't, however, expect them to find
          you so quickly. I thought you were
          suspended.

Dekker writes, "In The Know," on his pad.


          I was, but I'm back.   You're
          information's old.


          You never get what you pay for.
              
          You want to know about the hostages?
          How many and are they okay?

Dekker scribbles, "Pro".


          Yes.


          Approximately forty, they're fine,
          considering. All except one. We had a
          situation.


          Someone's dead?


          Theory... put to practice isn't always
          perfect. Can't expect to keep the
          hostages in check if a bad deed goes
          unpunished or they may... randomly
          decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
          order to it.
              
          Detective? Are you still with me?

Teddy SNAPS her fingers. That gets Conners attention.
There's a new intensity to his demeanor.


          What else will I be looking for?





                Demands... Probably too much to ask
                for you and your colleagues to pack up
                and go home?


                Safe to say.


                Stay by the phone.    I'll contact you
                shortly.


                Lorenz...


                Don't worry, I have no plans until
                sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's
                going to be a long one.


                Wait, we're talking here...


                Patience, Detective. We don't want
                another Pearl Street Bridge, do we?

     Conners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge.
     Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP.


                He's off.



     THE CROWDS GROW. The MEDIA BUILD UP INTENSIFIES.    THROUGH A
     TELEVISION CAMERA... Karen Cross reports:


                This standoff is approaching two hours
                now. We've been told Detectives have
                made contact with the perpetrators
                inside the bank. Whether any specific
                demands have been made, we cannot
                confirm. As soon as we know something,
                we'll pass it on to you. Reporting
                live, Karen Cross, channel two news.


                We're clear.


                Who the hell writes this shit?






      Black Clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag - ropes, pulleys,
      an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear-gun.

      #1 connects the rope to a spear. FIRES the spear into the
      wall above the bank's front windows! He snags a 2nd spear,
      repeats.



      The Detectives huddle.   Impatience level high.


                     
                 Try again.


                 He's not picking up.


                     
                 Try again.

      Dax, humbled, does as ordered.


                     
                 Where's our fearless Captain?


                 Went uptown to brief the Commissioner.


                 So you're here in his place.

      Conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks
      another piece of gum in his mouth. Teddy notices.


                 Nicotine gum.


                     
                 You quit smoking?


                 Caffeine, too, if you must know.
                     
                 What? A man's capable of change.


                 A man, yes. You...     I'm not so sure.





          Don't worry, I still have a vice or two.


          Fifteen rings.    No answer.


          Try again in five.


          What are they doing in there?


          Wasting our time.

Time. The word rings in Conners's head.     He starts to put it
together.


          Precisely. He knows police protocol,
          not to mention the shit in our own
          precinct. He's disguising his voice,
          means he's got a record and has done
          this before. He's heavily armed and
          well-connected. He knows he's
          surrounded. He hasn't asked for a
          damned thing. He drops that hint about
          sunrise, prepping us for a long wait.
          He's buying time. Why?


              
          To figure out his next move.    He wasn't
          expecting us.


          No, he wasn't expecting you. He said,
          he thought you were still suspended.


          Probably thought it would take the
          whole day for you to find me. Giving
          him the time he needs.


          He's stalling.


          He almost has what he came for.

Conners nods, eyes Dekker as if for the first time.





          Or... he's got what he came for and he's
          waiting for his ticket out of here.
              
          We're going in.


          What?


          The bank has three points of entry.
          Teddy and Vincent, take a SWAT Team,
          head to the West side. We'll have the
          SWAT Commander take the East. Dekker,
          you're with me. Where is the SWAT
          Commander?


          I'll find him.

Vincent leaves Conners with Dekker and Teddy.


              
          That's a big call, Quentin.   Thought
          about what you're doing?


          You questioning me, Teddy?


          Unfortunately... yeah.


          I question how you can fuck that
          asshole and still manage to look in the
          mirror.


          I'm not going to get into this now.
          And you're one to talk. I hear...


              
          The hostages are in imminent danger.
          They've confessed to killing someone, an
          automatic murder one charge - that's a
          life sentence, maybe a needle for all of
          them. So why keep witnesses around to
          testify? Longer we wait, the greater the
          risk. We need to go in. Now.





                    
                Okay.

     Even Dekker seems to agree with that theory. Vincent arrives
     with the SWAT COMMANDER, 40's, a former Navy SEAL with a
     "Don't FUCK with me" attitude.


                I got snipers up top and ten soldiers
                on the ground.


                What's the best way in?


                Tear gas, blow the doors...


                Hold on. No explosives. I got forty
                civilians in there, too great a chance.    Any
                other way?


                There's no pussy way in. The doors are
                locked electronically from the inside.
                We ain't getting in without force.


                    
                What if we cut the power? That will
                disable the system and we can open the
                locks manually, come in that way?


                    
                That'll work.


                So we'll take the pussy way, Commander.
                We cut the power and go in at 11:15
                sharp!





     SNIPERS ON ROOFTOPS ready their weapons.    SWAT TEAM moves
     into position, cover all bank entrances.



     Conners and Dekker slip into bulletproof vests.     Teddy,
     Vincent and the SWAT Commander arrive.





                  The bank's equipped with emergency
                  generators, which once the power's
                  down, will kick back on in
                  approximately 3-6 minutes.


                  It will be over before that.
                  Commander, your men in position?


                  Standing by.


                  I will call for the power to be cut.
                  Once down, wait for my signal and
                  enter. No one moves until I give the
                  "go", understood?

       They all nod.    They're ready.


                  You have done this before, right?
                  Wait... I don't want to know.



       VARIOUS SHOTS of HOSTAGES. It's quiet, until... Black Clad
       #1 and #4 burst, grab TWO RANDOM HOSTAGES, drag them out!
       They put up some fight, but quickly concede.

       The hostages sit shaking, crying...    Scared beyond belief.



       Lorenz watches out the window...

       POV OF LORENZ - SWAT, POLICE getting into position.

       Lorenz turns from the window.


                  They're comin'.



       Black Clad #1 and #4 drag the TWO RANDOM HOSTAGES, KICKING
       AND SCREAMING, towards the anchor/pulley!


                  What are you doing?! Let me go!

       #1 &amp; #4 fasten the Hostages to ropes connected to the
       pulleys!






     Behind a barricade, Conners crouches down beside Dekker and
     his SWAT Team.


                    
                Let's go around the horn.



     Teddy, Vincent and a SWAT Team...


                One, check.





     The SWAT Commander and his team...


                Two, check.



     A SNIPER holds his eye to the scope.


                Three, check.




                Four, check.



     Conners glances at his watch...


                Here we go... Cut the power.



     Instantly...   EVERYTHING BLACKS OUT!   LIGHTS, COMPUTERS, etc.

     THE HOSTAGES grab each other TIGHTLY.   PANIC evident.   Lorenz
     and the Black Clad calmly react.



     Conners makes the call...





                 Doors!

      Each Team makes their move, when...




                        
                 Now!



      Black Clad #1 PULLS A CORD, instantly...     ALL THE CURTAINS




      Conners freezes...


                     
                 Hold it. What just happened?



      Black Clad #3 FLIPS A SWITCH. Suddenly, a canister attached
      to the pulleys race up the ropes! The HOSTAGES have their
      feet yanked out from under them, then shoot INTO THE AIR!

      They SMASH THROUGH A GLASS HANDRAIL ON THE SECOND FLOOR,
      then...



      SHOOT to the TOP OF THE WALL-LENGTH WINDOWS! They hang,
      dangle helplessly! On FULL DISPLAY for the outside to see!


                     
                 Holy shit...?!

      DEKKER. CONNERS. SWAT. ONLOOKERS.       Everyone in the
      vicinity react in HORROR!

      THE NEWS CREWS, led by Karen Cross, race to grab the story.



      The SWAT Commander:


                 We're going in!






      Officers try to control the situation, but can't.
      Pedestrians racing around. Conners, in the middle of the
      anarchy...


                 No.    Do not go in.   It's a trap!


                 Stand down, Detective. This is my show
                 now.


                     




      The SWAT Commander makes his own call...


                 On my count... One... two... three...

      The SWAT TEAM bum rushes the bank, just as...

      KABOOM!   A FIREBALL BLASTS through the door, BLOWS off its
      hinges!   The SWAT guys are blown off their feet! Then...






      Everyone outside is BLOWN OFF THEIR FEET! Conners, Dekker



      Simultaneously, An EXPLOSIONS BLASTS OUT THE WEST SIDE DOORS!






      It's a genuine WAR ZONE!    SMOKE, FIRE AND DEBRIS LITTER THE




      Conners peers up as...    The HOSTAGES RUN OUT, SCREAM IN





     Conners and Dekker head for the bank, pass two groups of FOUR



                    
                Round up all the hostages, anyone that
                comes out, grab'em!

     Conners glares at Dekker.


                    
                The rest of you, come with us.

     The OFFICERS rush to protect the HOSTAGES, pull them to
     safety. CAMERA CREWS and REPORTERS pounce on the
     opportunity.

     Conners and Dekker lead the charge inside, guns drawn.



     EMERGENCY LIGHTS BURN! GLASS CRACKLES UNDER FOOT as Conners,
     Dekker and the Officers move through. Caution with each
     step.

     The lobby's clear.   Conners pulls the Officers close.


                    
                We split up.
                    
                You two with him. You two with me.
                    
                Check the back.

     Dekker nods, leads his group away.      Conner proceeds...



     Nothing. Conners spots a DOOR in the back marked, "Bank
     Employees Only."



     Dekker checks it out, but it's empty. The remnants of the
     explosion remain. Suddenly... THE GENERATORS ROAR TO LIFE!


     Dekker jumps, startled by the sudden blast of lights.






      ALL THE LIGHTS COME UP, as...   Conners KICKS IN THE DOOR,
      but... It's empty.



      Dekker leads his group. His heart POUNDING THROUGH HIS
      CHEST. His Gun up and ready. Suddenly...

      A NOISE up ahead... He bares down, takes a DEEP BREATH,
      carefully proceeds until... Teddy and Vincent emerge. Teddy
      EXHALES, lowers her weapon. So does Dekker.



      Conners strides out from behind the counters...


                     
                 See anyone come your way?


                 No.   No one went by me.

      The SWAT COMMANDER approaches holding a couple of the BLACK
      MASKS, some BLACK BODY ARMOR.


                 Detectives... We found these.

      Conners takes one of the masks in his hands.


                 We let them walk right past us.

      Dekker, Teddy, the SWAT Commander, Officers, Vincent and the
      SWAT Team stand in the middle of the lobby, STUNNED.
      Conners, his anger SIMMERS TO A BOIL, until finally...








      An OFFICER unfurls a FRESH ROLL of "POLICE: CAUTION" TAPE
      around the scene. Still mayhem, but gradually coming under
      control.

      Police interview HOSTAGES, so do REPORTERS. PARAMEDICS
      administer oxygen. Two CORONERS load the EAGER TELLER's body
      into their truck.






     Vincent, covered in debris, confers with Conners.


                We got the one Teller dead, the two
                that were strung up are alive, but in
                critical condition. A few SWAT
                incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's
                the worst of it. Now, depending on who
                you talk to... there was anywhere from
                five to nine perps. And nobody got a
                good look at any of'em, wore their
                masks the whole time. Dax is rounding
                up the security tapes now. That should
                give us a firm number.


                I want background checks on every
                hostage. They're all suspects until
                they're not.


                You don't think one of them's still
                here?


                After this, nothing would surprise me.



     Dax pulls cables, power cords, etc., getting set to go inside
     with them. Dekker approaches.


                Excuse me... I need to listen to the
                conversation between Lorenz and Conners
                again?


                It'll have to wait.


                How long?


                Hour.   Maybe more.


                    
                Show me how to play it myself?





                Look, this isn't how it works. I don't
                take orders from you. I don't know you
                and NO ONE touches my stuff. You're
                going to have to wait.

     Dax gets his shit, starts to go. Dekker waits, then proceeds
     into the van. Dax turns, notices.



     Dekker inspects the equipment, when...


                What the hell are you doing?


                Along with whatever they stole and this
                war zone they left behind... A man's
                dead, and the killers are running free.
                I don't have time to wait.
                    
                I'll figure it out. Thanks for your
                help.


                    
                Here. This DAT machine. Play, stop,
                rewind... It's just like using a tape
                player. Headphones are jacked in.
                Tape's already inside.


                Thank you.



     A CAR PULLS UP... Jenkins steps out. Stares out over the
     scene, the mess. He's a volcano ready to erupt.



     A SERIES OF EIGHT BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITORS... as we
     rewind. SEVEN of the eight show recorded images of the bank.
     The eighth shows only STATIC. Dax sits in front of the
     monitors. Conners stands nearby.


                    
                What's with this one?


                That's the camera in the vault.      It
                blew in the first explosion.




     The SEVEN DIFFERENT MONITORS all begin in sync.

     ON SCREEN... TIMECODE burns in the corner. The HOSTAGES are
     dragged across the LOBBY, where the Black Clads hook them up
     to the pulleys. The Black Clads get into position.

     Conners CAREFULLY scrutinizes the images.

     ON SCREEN... THE TIMECODE CLOCK:    Hits "11:15:00 AM" and...



                That's when you cut the power.


                So we can't ID them.


                There's a four minute, fifty-two second
                gap, before the image returns. But...


                They're long gone by then.
                    
                Go to the head of the tapes, from when
                they first went in. Document each move
                they've made for the two hours they
                were inside.


                You got it. Hey... Awful lotta news
                cameras outside. Maybe one got a look
                at them coming out?


                    
                Have Vincent check it out.

     Teddy enters...


                Conners, you better come out here.



     Conners and Teddy walk in to discover...    Captain Jenkins
     confers with FOUR FBI AGENTS in suits.


                    
                Shit. Feds.

     Jenkins turns to Conners, gestures him over.





                Detective Conners, join us, would you?



     Dekker listens through HEADPHONES makes notes as he goes.


                    
                What does that mean?


                Theory... put to practice isn't always
                perfect. Can't expect to keep the
                hostages in check if a bad deed goes
                unpunished or they may... randomly
                decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
                order to it.

     Dekker, hits STOP, then REWIND.     He checks his...



     Several words and phrases fill the page. "Lorenz, sunrise,
     Pro Theory, 40 hostages, Theory, Randomly Revolt, and Chaos."

     DEKKER studies the words intently, figuring something out.
     He presses PLAY on the DAT machine.


                Theory... put to practice isn't always
                perfect. Can't expect to keep the
                hostages in check if a bad deed goes
                unpunished or they may... randomly
                decide to revolt. Chaos... has some
                order to it.

     Dekker presses STOP. Dekker finds a pattern, circles the
     words, "Lorenz, Chaos, Theory."



     Conners, Jenkins and Teddy converse with AGENT VICTOR DOYLE,
     40's, and the BANK MANAGER still a bit rattled.


                Prince Amar Alle Alban is one of the
                wealthiest and least popular Arabs in
                the Middle East. There's been
                countless threats on his life and
                fortune in the past. But for better of
                worse... he is an ally to the United
                States. The Prince keeps a safe
                deposit box in twenty institutions




                    AGENT DOYLE 
          across the country. Along with this
          bank, he also had a box at Eastern
          Federal Savings in Charlotte, North
          Carolina, which was hit last month.
          Same M.O.


          What was in the box?


          We don't keep records. The boxes are
          private. Since 9/11, we screen for
          live tissue, viruses or explosives, but
          if it passes those tests, we don't ask.


          This is all real fascinating shit, but
          what about the money? Bank robbers
          still like cash, don't they?


          The cash drawers don't appear touched.
          Neither does the cash vault.


          So they broke into a bank and didn't
          steal any money?

Odd glances all about.


          We believe the Prince's box was the
          target. We're trying to reach him now.


          Thank you.

Agent Doyle and the Bank Manager leave.


          Helluva come back, Conners. Are you
          familiar with the term franchise-sized
          fuck-up...


          Depends, are we talking about your sex
          life? Because I've heard shortcomings.


          You got played, Quentin.
          Congratulations, you just topped Pearl
          Street Bridge.





                 That's not fair. It was by the book.
                 Everything was according to standard
                 procedure.

      Jenkins ignores Teddy.


                 You came to me. I didn't ask for this.


                 Commissioner's office is scrambling to
                 cover their ass. They need a
                 scapegoat... And I have zero problems
                 serving you up.


                 You wanted this to happen.


                 No. But if it had to happen to
                 somebody.

      Jenkins exits.



      Conners approaches...


                 I think this Lorenz was trying to tell
                 us something.


                 You don't say.


                 The way he spoke... he paused before
                 certain words. Have you ever heard of
                 the Chaos Theory?


                 What?



      A grade "B" rating, tops.   CUSTOMERS dine, choke down coffee.



      Empty plates and crumpled napkins litter the table. Conners
      finishes a cup of coffee, enjoys a slice of pie. Dekker, all
      about work, goes over his notes.





          Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory
          in the 1960's. It's the study of
          phenomena that appear random, but in
          fact have an element of regularity
          which can be described mathematically.


              
          Try that again?


          Pretty much... initial state of events
          may seem unrelated and random, but
          eventually patterns emerge and in the
          end all the pieces fit together.

The Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check.


          Anything else, officers?


          That'll be all.
              
          You're a College boy. Which one?
          Someplace I've heard of or one of those
          inbred state schools no one's heard of?


          U Dub.


          Not exactly Princeton, but not bad.
          How did you end up on the force?


          It's kind of the family business.


          Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's
          Dad and so on and so back?

Dekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info.


          Do we really need all this "get to know
          you" crap? Couple hours ago you didn't
          give a shit.


          You've grown on me. Besides, I am
          entrusting my life to you. I should
          know something about you. I would




                    CONNERS 
          think you'd like to know a little
          something about me.


          I know about you, Detective.      Everyone
          does.


          You don't say that with much
          enthusiasm.


          Not much to be enthusiastic about.

Conners reaches his limit.      Time to put him in place.


          Listen, my reputation often proceeds me.
          You, however, have no reputation; a fact I
          need to deal with. After you've been
          through the shit I have, then you can judge
          me. Now... we can try to work together,
          make the best of a bad situation or we can
          compare Dick sizes all day... Up to you.
          But since this is your first day here...
          today... mine's bigger.


              
          Conners, come in?

Both men hold steely stares on one another.     Until...


                
          Go.


          Got something you'll want to see.

Conners drops a TEN DOLLAR BILL on the table.


          Lastly... I don't like the Pac-10.
          It's overrated. I'm an Ivy League guy.

Conners gets up, heads for the door.

Dekker, humbled, scoops up Conners's ten, puts it in his
wallet and drops a twenty down on the table, slides out of
the booth.






      Conners, Dekker and Teddy approach a NEWS TRUCK. Vincent
      stands with Karen Cross and her CAMERAMAN who sports TWO



                     
                 Detective... Can't keep away from me,
                 can you?

      Conners ignores her, but Dekker doesn't.   He gives her the
      ONCE OVER. She notices, smiles.


                 Watch.

      He points to a monitor in the van, presses PLAY.



      HANDHELD IMAGES of the POST BANK MELEE. HOSTAGES scatter in
      all directions. COPS race into the bank.

      A SHAGGY BROWN HAIRED MAN, 40's, with a MOUSTACHE and an
      ANGRY EXPRESSION, CHARGES TOWARDS THE CAMERA and BARRELS OVER
      IT! KNOCKS the Camera and the Cameraman DOWN!


                     
                 Well, that explains you.


                     
                 Rewind it a little bit.
                     
                 Okay. There. Stop.

      ON SCREEN...   the IMAGE FREEZES on the SHAGGY MAN'S FACE.


                 Damon Richards. Career loser. Busted
                 him two years ago on attempted robbery
                 of the Western Federal Bank. Stupid
                 bastard. Never learns.


                 What's he doing back on the street?


                 He gave up his partners and cut a deal
                 with the D.A.





                Gotta love the system.


                Got an address?


                Only thing on file is in Spokane, but I
                recall he did have a girlfriend in
                town. Gina, I believe.



     The streets are quiet. A ROW OF HARLEY DAVIDSONS park in
     front. Above the bar, a small, lower class apartment
     complex.



     TWO POLICE OFFICERS along with Conners, Dekker, Teddy and
     VINCENT position themselves by the APARTMENT. Vincent knocks
     his fist on the door...


                Gina, it's the police.    Open up.

     There's no response.   But SOUNDS can be heard on the opposite
     side of the door.


                    
                We can hear you.

     Again no response.   It's quiet.    Too quiet.


                    
                Step back. Clear the door.     Now.

     Just as Vincent does...

     BAM! A GUNSHOT BLOWS APART THE DOOR!     Fired from the inside
     of the apartment!

     BAM! BAM! BAM! The BLASTS KEEP COMING!          Everyone's pinned
     down, on the defensive.



     Dekker gathers himself together.

     Conners TURNS INTO THE OPEN DOORWAY, FIRES A FULL CLIP INTO





      Conners reloads.     Everything's quiet.   Conners looks...



      A THIN LAYER OF SMOKE hovers.     But that's all.    Nobody in
      sight.



      Conners steps inside, just as he reaches the living room...

      BAM!   ANOTHER BLAST!    This one FROM THE BEDROOM!

      Conners DROPS TO THE FLOOR, falls back into the kitchen!




      Dekker enters the apartment.




                     
                 Shots fired, officer down!      Need an
                 ambulance and back up.



      Dekker passes the kitchen door, looks in on Conners.


                 You hit?


                     
                 I'm fine.

      OFF SCREEN: A Window BREAKS...      from the bedroom.   Dekker
      heads that way.



      DAMON RICHARDS crawls onto the FIRE ESCAPE!


                     


      But Richards doesn't.     He FIRES another shotgun BLAST!

      Dekker DUCKS BACK into the living room. He aims his gun into
      the bedroom without looking... RAPID FIRES!




      A bullet HITS Richards IN THE SHOULDER!     HE YELPS IN PAIN,
      but manages to...



      Richards scrambles out.



      Dekker looks inside the bedroom, doesn't see Richards.     He
      takes one step inside when...

      GINA, 20's, Latino, wearing only a pair of red panties with
      NO BRA, runs up behind Dekker and JUMPS ON HIS BACK, FISTS


      Dekker pushes her down, aims his gun at her.


                  Stay down!

      Vincent enters, grabs Gina.


                  Control her!

      He does.    Dekker runs to the bedroom window, peeks out
      over...











      Richards... floors below. Clutches his shoulder in pain, yet
      fearlessly charges downward.


                      
                  Suspect fleeing on foot. North on
                  Curson. He's armed and dangerous.      I'm
                  in pursuit.


                      
                  And who are you?

      But he's already gone.




      DEKKER hops onto the fire escape, hoofs down the iron stairs.

      Richards... drops to the pavement.      Heads for the street.

      DEKKER, a flight from the bottom, realizes his disadvantage
      and HURLS himself over the rail! Hits the ground HARD,


      Jumps up, shaking it off.    STAYS IN PURSUIT!



      Dekker races around the corner...    A FORD F-350 SPINS the
      corner. Targeting DEKKER!

      Dekker jerks out his Glock.    FIRES!

      BULLETS RICOCHET OFF THE GRILL, SPARKS FLY! Windshield
      spiderwebs. But this train ain't slowing down.

      The F-350 swerves, clips a Harley.

      Dekker JUMPS before impact, bounces off the hood and rolls
      away.

      The truck hits the street, speeds away.

      Dekker, grimacing through the pain, scrapes himself off the
      pavement. Dekker's eyes dance... spot THE HARLEYS.


                  I'm a police officer in pursuit of a
                  murder suspect. I need your bike, now!


                      
                  It's all yours.

      Dekker picks up the bike, hops on.      Fires up the engine.



      Richards' Truck speeds around a SLOW MOVING VEHICLE and whips
      into an alley.

      The Slow Vehicle skids to a stop! Dekker's hog, cuts inside,
      between the vehicle and the sidewalk, rips into the alley.



      Richards fishtails down the alley. Barely maintaining
      control. GARBAGE DUMPSTERS are littered about creating an
      obstacle course. Dekker pursues.






      Richards barrels out of the alley, through the intersection
      and into another alley. Opposing traffic skids out. ANGRY
      DRIVERS let him have it.

      Dekker skids sideways, steers around the blockage.     Catches
      sight of...

      DOWN THE BLOCK...   A PATROL CAR speeds down Hastings Street.

      Dekker revs the engine, maneuvers around the ANGRY DRIVERS
      and follows Richards into the SECOND ALLEY!



      Conners, behind the wheel, speeds towards the scene.



      Richards races, checks the rearview mirror...      Dekker's Hog
      closing in.

      UP AHEAD...   The alley exits onto RICHARDS STREET.

      Richards approaches the mouth of the alley, just as A STREET
      CLEANER appears, starts to block the exit.

      Richards STAMPS ON THE ACCELERATOR, speeds through the small
      opening, just past the Street Cleaner!

      Dekker's not so lucky. Sees the Street Cleaner too late...
      Lays out the hog and rolls just as... The Hog slides into
      the Street Cleaner!



      Dekker gets up, looks down the street, SEES...

      Richards getting away, speeds down the street, through
      another intersection, when...

      CRASH! Conners, in a patrol car, plows into the rear of the
      truck, spinning it around.

      Dekker races towards the crash site.

      Conners climbs out of the car.

      Richards shakes his head, clearing it. Blood squirts from
      his mouth. He sees, through the windshield, Conners coming
      for him. He scrambles for his handgun, looks up to see
      Conners, but he's not there. Richards turns as...




      Conners appears in the Driver's side window, grabs the back
      of Richards' head and SLAMS it into the steering wheel!
      Again!

      Conners reaches inside, grabs the handgun.   As Dekker
      arrives...


                 I want... my... lawyer.

      His last words before PASSING OUT.



      A HALF A DOZEN CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS go through the
      place.



      Gina, a cop's jacket around her, is led away in handcuffs.
      Dekker smirks.



      A PARAMEDIC, 30's, checks Conners out.    Teddy concludes her
      cellphone conversation.


                     
                 He's unconscious, with a nice knot on
                 his forehead, but stable. Three
                 officers are watching the room.


                 He wakes, they call.
                     
                 Hey Quincy, give it a rest, I'm fine.


                     
                 Quincy was a coroner. You may have a
                 cracked rib. You should go to the
                 hospital.


                 I should do a lot of things.

      The Paramedic gives up, exits.   Teddy leans down beside
      Conners.


                 You sure you're all right?





          I'm fine.

Conners and Teddy share a look, when...   Dekker enters.


          Girl's name is Gina Lopez, twenty-
          eight. Done some time for possession,
          has two kids... Am I interrupting?


          No.


          Excuse me.

Teddy exits.


          Gina claims she doesn't know anything
          about a bank robbery.


          Of course she doesn't.   Vincent!

Vincent trudges out of the kitchen.


          Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation
          one and turn the A/C on full. Leave
          her alone and cold. Let me know when
          her nipples can cut glass.


          Will do.
              
          Detective... I didn't realize when we
          first met who you were. I worked with
          your father. It was only for a brief
          time when I first got outta the
          academy, but it was an honor.


              
          Your father was Harry Dekker?


          I wish it could've been for longer.


          Thanks.

Vincent exits. Conners looks at Dekker in a new light.
Dekker starts away, until...





                   
               That was some fancy riding.    You have a
               bike?


               Used to, but I sold it.
                   
               They're dangerous.

     MARNIE ROLLINS, 20's, a CSI OFFICER, wears gloves, pokes her
     head in the room.


               Detectives. Ready for you.



     TWO LARGE SUITCASES rest OPEN on the bed.   Marnie prepares a
     report.


               Somebody going on a trip?


               Looks like it, don't it?


               Marnie, you're looking well.


               Heard you were back, Conners... and
               keep dreaming.

     Marnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns.


                    
               You, on the other hand... I gotta bike
               myself. Maybe we can go for a ride
               sometime? Or maybe I can just ride
               you.

     Conners looks at both of them.


               Can we get back to work?


               We got passports, sun tan lotion,
               Bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully
               hers and this...




She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside
the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations.


          Must be a fifty large there easy.    His
          cut?


          You'd think, right?


          It's not?


          Don't put words in my mouth, but...
          Two things jump out here. First, each
          bank branch has their own money bands.
          This is not American National's. After
          a little checking, it belongs to
          Pacific Savings of Seattle.


          That sounds familiar.


          It should. Four months ago, a half
          million dollars was stolen in an armed
          robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab
          job. They caught the guys a day later,
          recovering about $400,000. Those guys
          have been in lock up since and their
          trial's still pending. Which leads us
          to point number two. Do you smell
          that?


              
          What is it?


          When evidence is taken in, any physical
          contact might affect the ability to
          lift prints, so, to mark it, we now
          spray a scented solution directly on
          the bill.


          Is that new?


          Wave of the future.   Gotta keep up with
          the times, Conners.





                 So this money's not from our bank.


                 No. This is the money from the Pacific
                 Savings job and our evidence room.
                     
                 Now... For a list of things you can
                 put in my mouth.



     Conners and Dekker confer with Teddy and Vincent.


                 Do you remember who headed up the
                 Pacific Savings case?


                 I think it was Callo.    Why?


                 No reason.     Just thinking out loud.



     Conners and Dekker head back to the police station.   It's
     quiet between these two, until...


                 When you said it was your "family
                 business" I didn't think... I guess I
                 just didn't connect the dots.


                 Don't worry about it.


                 Your father was a hero.


                 Yes he was.


                 At first I thought maybe you were
                 related to the Captain.


                 No.   No relation.


                 The Captain, he just kind of
                 "discovered" you. Through the academy,
                 to excellent evaluation reports, while




                          CONNERS 
                on the beat, to the high test scores on
                the detective's exam.


                Something like that.


                That's how he found me.

     This surprises Dekker.


                Maybe we're not as different as you
                think.



     A small, cold room with a large mirror along the WEST WALL.

     Gina sits at the table, shivering. Her breath visible, so
     are her nipples through a WHITE, SEATTLE P.D. T-SHIRT.
     Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in
     the corner, observing.


                We found the money.


                That money was Dwayne's...


                That money came from our evidence room.


                I told you. I don't know nothing about
                a bank robbery. Whatever Damon was
                into, I didn't know!


                So, where were you going?


                Vacation.


                This isn't possession or solicitation,
                Gina. This is felony-murder one. You
                could get life.


                Me!?   I didn't do nothing!





              
          It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't
          do nothing" is a double negative,
          infers the positive. The grammar in
          this country sucks.


          Then I didn't do ANY-thing!

Conners takes a seat next to Gina.    His EYES BURN through
her.


          This isn't going away. You want to
          walk out of here, you tell me
          something... now.


          I swear I don't know. Now I'm done
          talking. I want a lawyer.

Dekker lowers his head.    Disappointed.


          You sure that's what you want?


          Yeah.


          Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll
          make. The first will be to the public
          defender's office. The second to
          children's services.


          What?

Suddenly Gina's bravado disappears.    Suddenly a scared and
lonely girl.


          It's simple... if you insist on a
          lawyer, I take your kids.


          No.


          Not like you cared about them anyway.
          You were ready to fly the coop with
          "Shit-for-brains."





                No.   You can't do that.


                I can and I will.


                Don't.


                Tell me what I want to know!

     Dekker stares incredulously at Conners.


                    
                I don't know anything.     Please don't
                take my kids. Please.

     Conners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth.
     Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders.


                Get her some coffee...     Something hot.



     Dekker and Conners...


                You believe her?


                I think for the first time in that
                girl's life she's telling the truth.


                You had to know, once she asked for a
                lawyer anything she told us would have
                been inadmissable.


                Who would've known? It would've been
                my word against hers. Who do you think
                the jury would've believed?


                Justice by any means.    Even if you
                cross the line.


                The only line around here is the `blue
                line', you cross that one, then you got




                          CONNERS 
                problems. Ask Callo, he knows what I'm
                talking about.

     Teddy enters, hands Conners a sheet of paper with: "EVIDENCE:
     ITEM #4958378" scribbled on it.


                Those serial numbers Marnie faxed me...
                According to our computers, that money
                should be downstairs.



     Occupies almost the entire basement of the police station.      A
     STEEL CAGE protects the contents.



     Conners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present.
     Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone.

     Dekker RINGS the service bell.

     Finally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the
     desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen
     better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners.


                    
                Buzz us in.


                    
                You gotta sign first.

     Conners and Dekker scribble their signatures down.


                I heard you were back. Kinda liked not
                having you around, Conners.

     Harry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied.   Then
     reluctantly BUZZES them in.


                Have another donut, Frankie.

     Dekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST
     ROWS OF EVIDENCE, scan the shelves, checking the number.


                That fat fuck is the sole guardian of
                the city's biggest source of
                contraband. Drugs. Weapons. Cash.




                          CONNERS 
                All totalled, about $50 million or so
                just sitting here for the taking.

      Finally, finding the right row, they turn in.


                You'd have to have some major
                firepower, not to mention an extra
                large set of balls to try and knock off
                a police station.


                Not if you were a cop.    You could just
                walk right in and...

      AN EMPTY SPACE, marked in tape, "ITEM #4958378."


                ...   Take whatever you want.   Shit.



      Dekker and Conners surround Harry as he digs through his file
      box. After a few moments, grabs a clipboard.


                Here is it. Line seventeen.


                Bernie Callo.


                Like I said... No one takes anything
                out of here, unless they sign for it.


                So what...     He showed you a warrant?
                What?


                He must've.


                You don't remember?


                You know how many times someone signs
                shit in and out? I see the same guys
                all the time. I can't remember one
                instance two weeks ago. But if his
                signature's there, that means he signed
                for it. Take it up with him!






     Jenkins listens as Conners and crew brief the situation.


                The money from Richards's place traced
                back to the Pacific Savings heist a few
                months ago, a case Callo headed up.


                Callo signed the money out of evidence
                two weeks ago.


                How much?





                If it's Callo, it would explain how
                they knew police protocol and how our
                department operates.


                Also explains why he was so pissed this
                morning about being replaced by
                Conners. He wanted to be the point so
                everything went according to plan.


                He doesn't need another reason to be
                pissed at me.


                What about motive?    Do we have one?


                Pressure might've been getting to him.
                He's been getting the cold shoulder
                from cops since he testified about
                Pearl Street Bridge.


                No.   Don't buy that.


                    
                He was also getting divorced.

     This is news to everyone.





                About a month ago, he told me he and
                his wife might be splitting. Asked if
                I knew a lawyer who wouldn't clean him
                out. I didn't think it was this bad.


                    
                Bernie Callo is a first rate cop.     A
                boy scout. This doesn't make any
                sense.


                They never do, Captain.


                Don't act like you're not enjoying
                this, Conners. I know what you think
                of him.


                Doesn't matter what I think.      Facts
                here speak for themselves.


                No they don't. We haven't asked the
                question... Why, if Callo's involved,
                don't they ask for him at the bank?
                    
                They asked for you.

     All eyes find Conners.   Then, Jenkins' PHONE RINGS...


                    
                Jenkins.





     The small home in a RURAL AREA is now COMPLETELY SURROUNDED
     by COP CARS.



     A typical family-themed home. FAMILY PICTURES adorn the
     walls. Everything in its right place. Except for... MRS.
     CALLO, 40's, sits in the kitchen SOBBING. Police encircle
     her.

     In the center of the Living Room... BERNIE CALLO LIES DEAD,
     a bullet wound right between the eyes.




     SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through
     every nook and cranny of the tiny home. Conners, Teddy and
     Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER...


                Wife came home approximately forty-five
                minutes ago. Found him here. None of
                the neighbors heard anything. There's
                no forced entry and no one saw anyone
                fleeing the scene.

     Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX.


                Blueprints from the bank, schematics,
                pictures... Also, about a dozen
                internet articles on the Saudi Prince.
                Found it behind the furnace.

     Conners nods.


                Well, that's it, right?

     Suddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers
     around. After the second ring, the ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS



                You've reached the Callo residence.   No
                one can get to the phone right now.
                Please leave a message.

     Then...   After the TONE...


                    
                Detective Conners... Are you there?

     Conners and everyone turns, listens.





     Lorenz stares ahead, transfixed by something.


                Are you connecting the dots? Are you
                putting it together? Is the pattern
                emerging? They wouldn't punish you,
                but I will.

     Conners GRABS the phone...





                Vengeance will be mine, Detective.


                Then come and get me you piece of shit.

     Lorenz smiles, hangs up.   He resumes staring at the wall in
     front of him.






     Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches...


                What they told Callo was the plan and what
                the plan really was may be two different
                things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan
                Callo would've agreed with.


                You'd think a cop would be smarter.


                As cops we come across every temptation
                in the book. Money, drugs, power.
                We'd all like to think we can resist
                any urge, but... We're not saints.


                So, Callo was involved and now they're
                dragging you into it. Why?


                Man said he wanted vengeance.


                Piss anyone off lately?


                Me?

     Both can't help but smile.      Jenkins walks up.


                I just got off the phone with Agent
                Doyle. After the Charlotte break in,
                the Prince withdrew all his possessions
                from every safe deposit box in this
                country.





                  Let me get this straight, they didn't
                  touch the cash or the safe deposit
                  boxes. So, they... break into a bank,
                  blow it up, and steal nothing?
                      
                  Still make sense to you?


                  Nothing about today makes sense.

       Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the
       Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police
       car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home.

       Dekker's mind works overtime, then...


                  "Return to the earth now if your mind
                  is troubled and your heart is
                  uncertain. For it is by returning to
                  the beginning that we can clearly see
                  the path."

       Conners and Jenkins share a confused look.


                      
                  Don't look at me, he's your find.


                  Say that again, Detective?


                  We go back to where this all started.
                  We go to the bank.



       The sun SINKS below the horizon.



       As night settles, POLICE and EMT workers are still on site.



       Dekker and Conners watch as Dax operates.


                  The tapes confirm five bad guys, but
                  since the vault cam blew in the
                  explosion what they did in there was a
                  mystery.




ON A COMPUTER MONITOR - The EIGHT SECURITY CAMERA ANGLES
appear.

ON THE MULTIPLE SCREENS... Just as in the opening, Lorenz
leads this crew through the bank. Immediately the group
splits up. IN THE VAULT... One of the Black Clads arrives
and radios in.


          I've been through these tapes twenty
          times already and nothing...


          Shutup.

MONITOR #5... IN THE VAULT, Black Clad #2 fires the
explosives! The image goes to STATIC.


          Wait, hold on a second.   Did you see it?


          See what?


          Go back a little.


          What?


          Notice the camera angles, they're all
          fixed. They don't rotate or pan.

Dax rewinds, to before the explosion...


          There. Stop. Play it. Look closely,
          camera five, the vault cam, dominates
          our attention because of the explosion.
          But while that's happening, check out
          Camera two, customer service.

ON SCREEN... Several BANK EMPLOYEES cower to the Black Clad.
Suddenly, another Black Clad DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE



          Where'd he go?

ON SCREEN... As the EXPLOSION GOES OFF, CAMERA #2 PANS AWAY






                He moved it. Changed the angle.    He
                didn't want us to see something.


                What's in that corner they didn't want
                us to see?

     Dax rewinds the tapes again, before the camera was moved and
     FREEZES FRAME ON: a lone COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.



     AT THE COMPUTER TERMINAL... A FORENSICS TECHNICIAN, 30's,
     carefully dusts the computer keyboard for fingerprints.

     Dekker and Conners look on.


                Are you at all concerned that there's
                some whacko out there looking to get
                you?


                If I worried about every threat made
                against me, I'd never leave the house.

     The Technician turns on a BLACK LIGHT and... FINGERPRINTS


     Conners looks to Dekker, impressed.


                    
                Those are priority one. If he's got a
                record, I want an I.D. yesterday.


                I'm on my way.


                Dax, can you hack in there and find out
                what they were doing on this machine?


                Hack into a nationwide bank's central
                computer system? Love to.


                What do we do in the meantime?


                You like Italian?






     The ITALIAN RESTAURANT HOST, 50's, jolly with a thick accent,
     greets Conners and Dekker.


                Detective, where you been? Much too
                long. Sit, sit. I give you best table
                in house. It'll just be the two?


                No, four.    More are coming.


                Wonderful, wonderful. Who's this young
                man?


                For all intents and purposes... he's
                Big Brother.


                    
                He's your brother?


                No.


                No matter, no matter...     I bring you
                bottle of house wine!


                We're still on duty.     No wine.


                    
                No wine?


                A little wine.


                That's better.

     They get to the table, Conners looks at it.


                Last time I was here, you said that
                table in the corner was the "best in
                the house."





               It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best
               table in house. Now relax, I bring you
               food.



     A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy.   PATRONS
     sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry.



     Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN
     OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been
     consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The
     mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day.

     Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent
     have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the
     Detectives, admires in their closeness.


               Shane, what was that thing you said
               back at the house about "returning to
               the beginning path" or something?


               It's a Buddhist story.


               We're all ears.


               One day the Buddha found his heart in
               turmoil. So he retreats to the forest,
               to the earth, to the base of a great
               tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this
               elephant comes up and tells Buddha he
               doesn't like seeing him discouraged.


               He can talk to an elephant?


               He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th
               level of consciousness. He's capable
               of communicating with plants, trees...
               even rocks.


               Rocks?


               You asked.





          Continue.


          The Buddha was troubled so he went back
          to where he came from, the beginning,
          to find the path, the answer. So when
          you hit a dead end, go back to the
          beginning to find your way. Or
          something like that.


          We have a genuine philosopher in our
          midst.


          You're a Buddhist?


          No. Just something I picked up along
          the way.


          But you're religious?


          Not particularly.

Conners stares curiously at his new partner.   Then excuses
himself to go to the men's room.


          You're all pretty tight.


          We've been through a lot together.


          I guess I just thought... I don't
          know. With all the trouble he's been
          in lately, coming back from suspension,
          everyone would treat him differently.


          You can't believe what you read or see
          on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners
          is stronger. He's one of the best.
          Even when things got pretty wild today
          and everyone else panicked, he was in
          control. That doesn't just happen.
          He's just that good.


          Excuse me.




     Teddy heads for the ladies room.


                What was the Buddha looking for?


                The divine in himself.

     Art's confused.    Dekker's cellphone rings.


                How long does it usually take to for
                fingerprints to be ID'd?


                Hours, maybe days.    We could be waiting
                a while.


                    
                Dekker./ Okay.
                    
                They got a match.



     LONG CURTAINS divide the rooms.

     Conners exits the men's room, Teddy appears and before a word
     can be spoken... SHE KISSES HIM HARD, PASSIONATELY ON THE
     LIPS. Conners gives in for just a moment. He breaks the
     embrace.


                What are you doing?


                I realized something today. Being
                around you, all that's happened...       I
                can't... I think I made a mistake.


                It's too late. You've made your
                choice. Live with it.

     This jab hurts Teddy and Conners knows it.     Dekker parts the
     curtains...


                We got a match.

     Teddy separates from Conners.





                You got a name?


                Chris Lei.


                    
                Sonofabitch.



     Conners drives, Dekker reads Chris Lei's file. On top of the
     file is a MUGSHOT PHOTO of, "Lei, CHRIS". He's an early-30's
     Chinese-American with a "weasel factor" off the charts.


                Prick used to work for some big-time
                software company until they caught him
                dipping into the company's slush fund.
                They didn't want the publicity so they
                didn't press charges. Couple years
                later, he was busted for looting the
                pension plans of retired cops. For a
                genius... he's a fucking moron.


                This was your case. You and York. You
                made the bust. Why didn't it stick?


                His lawyer put us on trial. Said we
                were crooked, abusive, that we planted
                evidence... We were in the midst of
                the Pearl Street Bridge fallout. Jury
                bought it. They let him walk and we
                were the scapegoats.


                Was it true?


                The guy was guilty. He was scum. That
                was the truth.
                    
                There's something they don't teach you.
                The system breaks down. You have to
                compensate to get results.


                That gives you the right to break the
                rules?





                 Break, no.     Bend... if it means
                 justice...     Absolutely.


                 Another thing they don't teach you.



      Off the main road, sits a DARK, TWO-STORY HOME on a HILLSIDE.



      The design is MODERN, FLAWLESS and COLD. Every room is
      equipped with VIDEO CAMERAS and MONITORS.

      ON THE MONITOR... The screen is divided into 16 small boxes
      showing the actions simultaneously throughout the house. Our
      concentration settles on BOX #7...



      CHRIS LEI, live and in the flesh, quickly stuffs belongings
      into a suitcase. He's nervous, tense. From the top drawer
      of his dresser, he grabs an armful of underwear, socks, dumps
      them into the suitcase.

      What Chris doesn't see...





      Conners pulls the car to the curb.    He and Dekker hop out.



      From his second floor window, Chris sees Conners and Dekker.


                 Shit.

      Chris turns, FINDS HIMSELF STARING DOWN A BARREL!


                 Fare thee well, Chris.

      Chris swallows, Lorenz pulls the trigger and...



      BAM! THE GUNSHOT ECHOES OUTSIDE. Conners and Dekker draw
      their weapons, quickly descend on the house!






      THE FRONT DOOR KICKS IN! Dekker and Conners cautiously
      enter. They move the way veteran partners would. No
      indications that these two just met today.

      The House is almost PITCH BLACK.

      Conners motions that he's going up, signals for Dekker to
      take the back of the house.



      Dekker proceeds inside.   After a scan, the kitchen's clean.



      Conners emerges from the stairway.



      Dekker steps from the back hallway into the DARKENED living
      room. Eyes straight ahead and sharp. What he doesn't see...





      Conners moves from the hall, into the bedroom where he
      finds... Chris's dead Body. He checks for a pulse when he
      notices...

      ON THE MONITOR... Conners sees A SHADOWY FIGURE BEHIND
      Dekker!



      Dekker, oblivious to Lorenz's presence, continues on.    Heads
      for the front hallway.

      Lorenz raises his gun, narrows his sites on Dekker.

      Simultaneously... CONNERS DIVES, TACKLES DEKKER BEHIND the
      living room wall -- LORENZ OPENS FIRE, UNLOADS A FULL CLIP!




      Conners and Dekker, behind the wall, regroup. Conners
      RETALIATES. FIRES FOUR ROUNDS AT LORENZ, but...










       Lorenz bursts through the back door, down the stairs!



       Conners and Dekker...


                  You okay?


                  Yeah.



       Dekker and Conners emerge from the house...     LORENZ, on the
       other end of the yard, OPENS FIRE!

       The Detectives DIVE FOR COVER!

       Lorenz exits through the fence's door...



       ... and climbs into a BLACK MERCEDES-BENZ, quickly peels
       away!



       Dekker and Conners bounce up, run out the back fence, but...



       As they get there... LORENZ'S MERCEDES, turns out of the
       alley and disappears into the night.

       Dekker stares out, deflated.















       POLICE AND EMERGENCY CREWS surround the house.




      An EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, 30's, attends to Dekker's
      injured shoulder. Dekker grimaces from the pain. Conners
      approaches...


                 First day in the city and you've
                 already been shot.


                 It just grazed him.


                 Why don't I "just graze" you with a
                 bullet and see how you feel.


                 Your Damon Richards is awake.



      To establish.



      HANDCUFFS lock Richards to his bed. Richards is hooked up to
      an IV and a tube's up his nose. A HEART RATE MONITOR chimes
      rhythmically.

      Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS look on as Conners and Dekker enter.


                     
                 Take five, guys.

      The officers exit. Conners LOCKS the door, walks to the bed,
      leans over Richards.


                 Hiya, Damon. How you feeling?


                     
                 May I?

      Conners concedes the floor.     Dekker addresses Richards.


                 You remember me, don't you?
                     
                 Thought so.

      Dekker turns his attention to Richards' IV, the tubes which
      carry medication into his body.




       From a nearby medicine cabinet, Dekker rummages around.


                  I was skiing about three years ago.
                  Aspen. Beautiful country. Ever been?
                  Never mind. I hit a mogul, landed on a
                  sheet of ice and slammed into a tree.
                  Broke myself up pretty bad. Kinda like
                  you did today. I was in a hospital bed
                  for three months. Had it not been
                  for... Here it is.
                      
                  Morphine. Without this stuff, I
                  wouldn't have made it.

       Dekker fills a syringe with the entire bottle.


                  Now this IV drip administers a small
                  dosage every minute. Makes you feel
                  relaxed and calm. No pain. But...

       Dekker sticks the syringe needle tip into the IV bag.


                  If I were to inject this whole thing...
                  That would be all she wrote for Damon.


                  You don't have the balls.

       Dekker PRESSES down on the syringe, just a little, but enough
       to go into the bag. Richards can't believe it.


                  This equipment malfunctions all the
                  time. Overdoses are quite common.
                  Besides, I don't think the DA's going
                  to launch a full-scale investigation
                  over a scum like you.

       Richards attempts to signal for a nurse, but Dekker pulls the
       call button away.


                  You don't have to tell us a damn thing.
                  Plead the fifth... roll the dice.

       Dekker SQUEEZES in some more, until...   Richards gives in,
       signals that he'll talk.



       Conners and Dekker exit, head to their car...





                  You fuckin' hypocrite. You give me
                  shit for my interrogating skills...
                  least I don't threaten them with a
                  lethal overdose.

       Dekker holds the empty vile up, hands it to Conners.


                  There's never been a single case in
                  recorded medical history of someone
                  overdosing on 200 milliliters of
                  saline.

       Conners checks the label, smiles.


                  Bend, not break. That's what you said,
                  right?



       Lorenz, AKA SCOTT CURTIS, enters his car.


                  Lorenz's true identity is Scott Curtis.
                  He's wanted in connection to three
                  other bank robberies, extorsion and
                  kidnapping.



       Jenkins stands before Conners, Dekker, Teddy, Vincent and two
       new Detectives - DET. TOMMY BRANCH, 40's and DET. JEROME
       KNIGHT, 50's.


                  He's also the brother of John Curtis,
                  the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street
                  Bridge.
                      
                  Richards testifies that he was hired by
                  Curtis to pull the bank job with a
                  dirty cop on the inside, Bernie Callo.
                  Curtis hoped that Conners would take
                  the fall for American National turning
                  ugly, disgracing him even further. We
                  also have the names of two more
                  accomplices, Lamar Galt and Xander
                  Harrington. Everyone was set to meet
                  tonight at ten and we have that
                  address.
                      
                  After finding Callo and Lei dead today,




                            JENKINS 
                  it doesn't take a rocket scientist to
                  know Curtis is eliminating his
                  accomplices. Doesn't matter what
                  Curtis told Galt and Harrington, he's
                  going to finish them off tonight.



      Conners drives, Dekker shotgun.      Conners more intense than
      normal.


                  You never think of the repercussions.
                  The suspect's mother, father...
                  Brother. How your decision affects
                  them.
                      
                  He had murder in his eyes.


                  John Curtis.


                  It was pouring. Lights everywhere.       If
                  he had only done what I said.





      Conners, RAIN POUNDING DOWN, aims his gun, MOUTHS THE



                  Drop the weapon.

      JOHN CURTIS, the kidnapper on the bridge, aims his gun,









                  But it was not to be.


                  My father died when I was twelve. He
                  walked into a liquor store in the
                  middle of a stick up. Guy just opened
                  fire. Never even had time to react.
                  They said he was a hero. Know what




                              DEKKER 
                   that means to a twelve year old?
                       
                   Because he died on the job, he's a
                   hero? Never made sense to me.


                   So why become a cop?


                   Finish what he started. Every day he
                   went out, trying to do some good. Help
                   the people who couldn't help
                   themselves, just give'em a chance is
                   what he always said. Didn't always
                   work out right, but he tried. You
                   tried to help save that girl on the
                   bridge. If you weren't there, the girl
                   still would've died. She had a chance
                   because you were there. That's all we
                   can do.



        A two story house sits on a quiet corner in a quaint
        neighborhood. CRICKETS CHIRP, break the silence of the
        night. Two CARS sit in a gravel driveway.



        Through the open windows... Two men, LAMAR GALT, 40's, and
        XANDER HARRINGTON, 30's, sit in silence. Their patience
        thinning.



        IN THE SHADOWS... In various HIDING SPOTS...       Conners and
        Dekker look out at the house.



        DET. BRANCH, looks at his watch, then to DET. KNIGHT.


                       
                   It's twenty-five after. How much
                   longer we wait?




                       
                   We go now all we get is Galt and
                   Harrington. We want Curtis. Now relax
                   and keep the line free.




                            CONNERS 
                      
                  This prick's driving me crazy.

       Conners digs into his pocket, realizes...


                  Shit.


                  What?


                  I'm out of gum.


                      
                  Head's up. Car's coming.



       A BROWN CHEVY drives past the house, but KEEPS GOING.




                  Shit.



       Galt and Harrington react the same to the car driving by.
       Harrington CHECKS HIS WATCH, barks at Galt. Heads for his
       car.



       Teddy and Vincent watch...


                      
                  Conners, we got a problem.




                      
                  We hold. No one move.




                       
                  We can't let him walk.   We have to go
                  now.







                       
                   No. Stand down.






                       
                   We're going to lose'em, Conners.




                       
                   No. No go. We wait.



       Harrington curses at Galt who stands on the front porch.
       Harrington waits while Galt he makes a cellphone call.




                       
                   We bust them now, we got something.
                   But if they get in that car we don't
                   have jack squat.




                   We have three cars here and uniformed
                   backup in all directions, if they ride,
                   we'll get them. I want Curtis. We
                   don't go in that house until I say!



       Galt hangs up.     Harrington unlocks his car door.





       Harrington's the first to hear it.     In the dead silence,
       everyone soon does.

       Just as Teddy's able to silence it... Harrington SPOTS her
       car, doesn't think twice, just starts FIRING!




      His bullets keep Vincent and Teddy pinned down.

      Knight hurries out of the car...

      HARRINGTON sees this, FIRES!

      The bullet STRIKES KNIGHT IN THE NECK!



      Simultaneously...    BRANCH FIRES!    HARRINGTON FIRES!

      THE BULLET RIPS INTO HARRINGTON'S ARM! He's hit, but not
      down. He and Galt duck back inside the house!

      Branch takes a bullet in the leg.      He goes down.




                 Trigger happy, Sons of bitches!



      Conners, Dekker, Vincent, Teddy converge on the house.


                 We take them alive!


                     
                 All units, all units. Shots fired!
                 Requesting backup immediately!

      They all rush inside...



      Conners and Dekker make their way up the stairs...



      Teddy and Vincent head down the hall...



      Conners and Dekker move carefully. Conners points for Dekker
      to go in the other direction. Dekker obeys, slides down the
      other side of the hall.



      Teddy's on her toes.   She smells something, but keeps moving.




       ON THE FLOOR...    A trail of BLOOD leads to the DINING ROOM.

       Teddy signals to Vincent.   "That way."



       Conners enters, checks it out.



       Dekker stands outside the closet. He opens it quickly, but
       it's empty. Except for... On the far wall -- HUNDREDS OF
       PICTURES of Conners. The same shrine we saw Lorenz in front
       of earlier.



       Vincent swings in from one entrance, Teddy the other.   She
       takes a cautious step out, when...




       HARRINGTON, from the corner, takes aim again!

       VINCENT drops to the floor, aims through the dining room
       table legs and FIRES!

       THE BULLET TEARS INTO HARRINGTON'S SHIN!   He SCREAMS IN PAIN,




       Conners HEARS THE SHOTS, runs out of the room.



       So does Dekker.



       Teddy moves in on Harrington.


                 Drop the gun!

       Harrington holds his gun UP AND OUT towards Teddy.   Is he
       aiming or surrendering?


                 Drop it now. Last warning.

       But he doesn't.




       BAM! TEDDY PUTS A HOLE IN HARRINGTON'S CHEST!       He slumps
       down, dead.



       Conners and Dekker meet by the top of the stairs.


                 Teddy!?     What's happening?

       Vincent appears at the bottom of the stairs.


                 We got one down. He's dead.



       Dekker and Conners share a look, disappointed.      But then
       something catches Conners's eye.

       BEHIND DEKKER...     a door OPENS...   LAMAR GALT AIMS HIS







       Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of
       time!

       DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!    Vincent breaks his fall.

       GALT FIRES AT CONNERS, until he's out of bullets.      He ducks
       back behind a door.

       Conners FIRES!   But did he hit anyone?     Conners pursues...



       Dekker grabs his head, in pain, but okay.



       Teddy leans against the wall, spots A VENT...       A FLASH GOES




       Conners creeps inside the partially open doorway. It's
       quiet, until... LAMAR GALT lunges, tackles Conners! His gun
       flies from his hands.






      Teddy's EYES fall to...

      ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE.         It
      runs from the wall into the vent.

      She follows it into THE KITCHEN.


                   Gas.
                       
                   Get out of here!     Get out of here NOW!



      Vincent and Dekker get up.        Dekker looks upstairs...


                   Conners!



      Conners and Galt struggle. Conners PUNCHES Galt, sends him
      back! He then SLAMS Galt against the wall, Galt KNEES
      Conners in the gut.

      Galt goes for the gun, Conners KICKS out his legs from
      underneath him! But before Conners can get the upper hand,
      Galt fights back! The two continue...



      The fuse comes out of the vent... IT'S LIT!       THE OVEN...
      HEAR the gas emission...



      Teddy rushes from the house...


                   Everyone get down!



      The spark.    The Gas.    The EXPLOSION!











       The EXPLOSION KNOCKS Conners and GALT OFF THEIR FEET!
       Conners HITS THE FLOOR HARD! Galt's head slams against the
       toilet.



       Teddy watches as... A COUPLE OF UNIFORMED COPS race to
       Vincent and Dekker, drag them away.



       Conners leans over Galt, a giant GASH across his forehead,
       feels for a pulse. He's dead. Conners looks into the
       hallway, SEES THE FIRE!



       Dekker looks around...


                  Where's Conners?

       Dekker and Teddy look to the house, when...






       DEKKER gets up, watches the FLAMES CONSUME THE HOUSE!

       TEDDY runs towards the house, when...   DEKKER stops her.


                  No!   No, we have to go save him!


                  We can't.


                  We have to.


                  Teddy...


                  No!

       They both stare at the house.    Dekker holds her, she's a
       mess.






      Lorenz AKA SCOTT CURTIS watches through a pair of binoculars.
      No emotion evident.





      FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES surround the
      house. The LIGHTS FLASH AN EERIE RED across the scene.
      FIREMEN try to extinguish the flames.

      Several NEWS TRUCKS have arrived, always after the story.

      A CORONER, 40's, zips shut a body bag. Inside the BADLY
      BURNT BODY of Detective Conners. The BADGE ON HIS BELT still
      visible. They load him into the truck.

      TEDDY, her face drained of life, stares at the truck. A
      Fireman walks behind them, back towards the fire truck.

      JENKINS huddles with a group of Detectives.


                 ...   If it had to be someone...

      Teddy and Dekker overhear this.


                     
                 You sonofabitch.


                 Teddy...


                 You've always been jealous of him.


                 Jealous?


                 It's because he wasn't only a better
                 cop... He was a better man.


                 Detective.     Go home.

      Teddy really wants to explode, but doesn't. She walks away.
      Jenkins digests what she said, then his eyes find Dekker...


                 You have something you want to say?





                 No, Captain. She said it perfectly.



      KAREN CROSS finds Teddy, has her Cameraman FOCUS in on her.


                 Detective Galloway, could you give us a
                 comment?

      Teddy looks STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA, but can't say a thing.
      That's when DEKKER grabs the camera, PUSHES it out of her
      face.


                 We just wanted a statement.


                 Shame on you.


                 This is more than just news for us.
                 American National's CFO sits on the
                 Board of Channel Two. They have a
                 vested interest in what's going on.


                 Find another source.

      Karen and her Cameraman leave Teddy and Dekker alone.


                 Conners was right. We should've never
                 gone in. How many more mistakes can we
                 make in one day? He was eliminating
                 his accomplices. We thought he was
                 going to show up? We didn't even think
                 he could do this... How dumb are we?



      Quiet, mostly dark.     A few fluorescent lights and a desk
      lamp...

      Dekker sits at Conners' desk. A somber moment, reflecting on
      the man, his career. He shuts off the lamp, heads for the
      door.


                 Detective?

      Dekker turns to find...       Dax, cradling a 3,000 PAGE DOCUMENT.





          I know what they were doing inside the
          bank.



Dax flips through the huge document.


          These are today's transaction records
          from the bank. An average day produces
          about 400 pages, give or take. Today,
          there were over 3,000 pages.


          Meaning?


          We've just witnessed the largest heist
          in history. Somewhere in the
          neighborhood of a billion dollars.


          Come again?


          It's a computer virus. "The Computer
          Virus." It randomly withdraws money
          from all the accounts and deposits it
          into the bad guys' account. If you
          check the transactions, no two
          withdrawal amounts are the same and
          none of'em are over $100. Most
          security systems work on the size of
          the money, not number of transactions.
          Wire out one million from a handful of
          accounts and red flags go up. Wire out
          a less than a hundred from ten million
          accounts, no flags.


          Where's the money now?


          I tried following one of the
          transactions. It took me an hour and
          when I finally had it... It went away.


          How is that possible?


          The virus created a host of phantom
          accounts where the money goes




                           DAX 
                 temporarily, then transfers to another
                 account, then to another. It's never
                 in one place long enough to get an
                 accurate fix.


                 It's still moving the money around?


                 Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from
                 any bank doesn't usually go into affect
                 until the next business day. So it's
                 going to keep jumping around until it
                 clears at 9 AM tomorrow.


                     
                 Or 6 AM Pacific time. Sunrise. So why
                 break in? If they're just wiring
                 money? Couldn't they do that from
                 anywhere?


                 That's the regional manager's computer
                 terminal. There's no outside/remote
                 access to it. There you have unlimited
                 entry to the bank's mainframe. No
                 passwords to work around, no "hacking"
                 in. It's all nice and clean.


                 A billion dollars is missing and we're
                 only discovering this now?


                 Ironically, when the power went out, it
                 helped hide the virus and bought it
                 time to work.


                 So they weren't trying to make   it look
                 like they were robbing a bank,   to rip
                 off a Saudi Prince? They were    making
                 it look like they ripped off a   Saudi
                 Prince to rob a bank.
                     
                 The Chaos Theory.





      Dekker shuffles to his car, his cellphone rings.
      Answering...





                 Dekker.


                 Detective Dekker, there's a call for
                 you. Says it's urgent.


                 Put it through.


                 Good evening Detective. I just wanted
                 to compliment you on a fine day. You
                 were an unexpected adversary that was
                 most challenging.


                 It's not over yet.


                 Wishful thinking.


                 No. My wish is to catch you. You're a
                 murderer. A cop killer at that.


                 I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve
                 it. Callo was insignificant and
                 Conners crossed me. In years to come
                 you'll thank me for getting rid of him
                 before he corrupted you.


                 I know about the money. You steal a
                 billion dollars... They will find you.


                 A risk I'm willing to take. It's
                 almost sunrise. Fare thee well.

      Lorenz hangs up. Dekker surprisingly calm, hangs up the
      phone, heads back inside the station.



      Dekker at his desk, piles through mounds of paperwork.   Not
      sure what to look for, he goes through everything.

      His notes from the bank. The file on Galt, Harrington, Chris
      Lei. He even digs through Conners and finally... Callo's
      file.

      Jenkins heads for the exit.





                 You're still here?


                     
                 Callo's insignificant.


                 What?


                 That's what he said, Callo's
                 insignificant. But he wasn't.


                 What are you talking about?


                 Lorenz...    Curtis...   Called me.


                 He called you?


                 He said he didn't kill anyone who
                 didn't deserve it. He said Callo was
                 insignificant. But without Callo he
                 wouldn't have had the knowledge of our
                 department and...
                     
                 ... He wouldn't have had the front
                 money to hire the crew.


                 He was screwing with your head. Go
                 home, Shane. You did good today. Your
                 Dad would be proud. Get some sleep.
                 There will be more bad guys tomorrow.

      Jenkins exits.

      Dekker falls back into his chair. Then... discovers...
      Callo's file... The Property Room Sign-Out Sheet. The
      signatures.



      Harry Hume, the evidence room cop, out of uniform, walks
      inside, sits across from... Dekker, already here, with two
      DIFFERENT FILES available to him.


                 I was in bed already.     This couldn't
                 wait til morning.





              
          How did he come at you, Harry? It's
          the only thing that doesn't make sense.


          What are you talking about?


          All day long we thought Callo was the
          dirty cop. All day long we were wrong.

Dekker slides some papers in front of Harry.


          That's the sign-out sheet from the
          evidence room. Here's one of Callo's
          reports. Here's another one... and
          another --

The SIGNATURES ARE DIFFERENT, but Harry doesn't even examine
them. He knows.


          They're not the same signature, Harry.
          They're not even close.


              
          Maybe he had a cramp in his hand.    I
          don't know.


              
          This is your file... You were
          reprimanded, a month ago after you
          confronted Callo at the courthouse.
          You punched him. That ring a bell?


          And I'd do it again. Cops who testify
          against cops shouldn't be breathing the
          same air I do. There's a line you
          don't cross!


          So you set him up! You forged Callo's
          signature, you gave him the money and
          you helped him with his plan because
          you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl
          Street Bridge! Don't deny it, Harry
          cause I know.















      Images FLASH before our eyes...

      The RAIN POURS DOWN!   An SUV CRASHES into a STALLED-OUT


      JOHN CURTIS  crawls out of the SUV! He sees
      cop's lights approaching. He drags LISA REANN 
      out of the truck. A BRIGHT LIGHT  strikes
      John in the eyes!

      LIGHTS!   EVERYWHERE BRIGHT!   It's all very BLINDING!

      COPS block both sides of the bridge!   TV REPORTERS AT EITHER


      John holds the gun up to Lisa's head as... OVER JOHN'S


      Lisa struggles, tears streaming down her face.





      John DROPS lifeless to the pavement.





      Harry pounds the table...


                 You're helping a cop killer, Harry.
                 You're a year from pension. This is
                 how you want to go out?


                 My conscience is clean.


                 This has been a very long, trying day.
                 And I'm tired. We're chasing a




                           DEKKER 
                 phantom. Just when we have him... he
                 disappears. He's been two steps ahead
                 of Conners and me all day.


                 Of course he has.   Who knows Conners
                 better than him?


                     
                 How the hell does Curtis know Conners
                 better than anyone?

      Harry goes silent.   Realizes he just let the cat out of the
      bag.


                     
                 We're not talking about Curtis, are we,
                 Harry?
                     
                 Who would know Conners better than
                 anyone? Who would you protect? And
                 who in your mind got the raw deal at
                 Pearl Street Bridge?











      NOW RESUME ACTION... Conners and York aim their guns at...
      John holds Lisa tight.


                 Drop the weapon. Let the girl go.

      John PUSHES the barrel of the gun TIGHTER into Lisa's temple.


                 That, you don't want to do.

      York narrows his aim on John Curtis.


                 One step closer and the girl dies.





                 Think about this... you kill her,
                 where are you going to...

      SIMULTANEOUSLY... YORK FIRES just as Lisa STRUGGLES, MOVES!
      The Bullet intended for John Curtis, HITS Lisa, kills her
      instantly.

      Lisa's body crumples to the ground.

      Conners and York look on in horror, knowing York's bullet
      felled an innocent.

      John turns to fire on the detectives...      Conners fires -
      KILLS John Curtis!

      John's body hits pavement.      RAIN POURS DOWN!



      Dekker puts it together...


                 It was York who was the bad cop. He
                 assumed Scott Curtis's identity to
                 throw us off the trail.



      Dax and Teddy are speechless.




                 York plays his old partner, knowing all
                 his moves, frames his enemy for the
                 crime, kills him too and pulls off the
                 biggest robbery in history.


                 Do what you want to me. He called to
                 tell me he was going and he's gone and
                 you ain't never going to find him.


                 Watch me.



      Dax and Dekker gather at Dax's desk.      Dax is on the phone.


                 The number York used to call Harry Hume
                 is a cellphone number. Ran it through




                            DAX 
                  local service providers.    Nextel got a
                  match.


                  Can they get a location on him?


                  That particular phone he's using is
                  equipped with the latest GPS
                  technology. Should be able to trace
                  his location within 100 meters or less.
                      
                  Yeah?
                      
                  They got him.



       Dekker and Dax examine a map.


                  The signal's coming from around 175th
                  street. That's about fifteen miles
                  north of us.
                      
                  From the harbor he can take a boat or a
                  sea-plane out. He's gone.


                      
                  No. If there's a signal. Means he's
                  still here. He's waiting for something
                  or someone.


                  Waiting? Where? Ain't nothing down
                  there that's open at this hour.


                      
                  175th street... There's is one place.



       Dekker runs to his car and as he gets there, Teddy's waiting
       for him.


                  I'm going with you.


                  Detective Galloway...





                     
                 It's not a request.



      A BEAUTIFUL, BRIGHT FULL MOON hangs in the dark sky. Dozens
      of COMMERCIAL LINERS, CARGO SHIPS and SEAPLANES line the
      piers.



      Open twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year. A handful of
      cars occupy the spaces out front. Including the MERCEDES.



      A scattering of PATRONS, some at the counter, some in booths.
      A PRETTY WAITRESS, 20's, rings up a bill.


                 That'll be $8.48, please.

      YORK AKA LORENZ/CURTIS hands the Cashier a twenty.


                 Keep the change.


                 Thanks, mister.

      A BUS BOY, 19, carries some garbage out the back.

      York heads for the exits, opens the door and... STEPS




      York hoofs two steps outside when...

      A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT STRIKES YORK'S FACE!   He shields his
      eyes...

      BEHIND THE LIGHTS... Dekker and Teddy aim their pistols.


                 Jason York... this is the police. Put
                 your hands in the air and slowly get on
                 your knees. Do it. Now!


                 Don't shoot. You win.

      York RAISES HIS HANDS HIGH, takes a small step backwards.





                    Get down on the pavement!


                    I'm cooperating.   You win.

      York takes another tiny back-step.







      York bends down to ONE KNEE, DRAWS A 9 MM... FIRES!










                        
                    Take the back!





      Dekker enters, surveys the restaurant.



      Dekker approaches the kitchen door, pushes it open and...



      Dekker spins out of the way. As gunfire stops, Dekker KICKS
      through the door! Leans in gun first...



      In the center of the room... York neck-holds the Pretty
      Waitress, gun to her head.

      Dekker moves in...


                    Was it Harry? It was Harry, right?
                    That fat fuck!





          Let the girl go. It's over.

York's EYES BLAZE WITH ACTIVITY!    Something brewing.


          Easy for you to say. I'm a plane ride
          away from a King's Ransom.

THROUGH A SIDE DOOR... Teddy slides in, unnoticed.


          Drop the weapon, let the girl go.


          And spend the rest of my days in a
          cage? Let me ponder...
              
          Don't think so. If you're going to
          stop me... I'm gonna make you earn it.


          That you don't want to do.


              
          That's exactly what I said to him. Do
          you see the irony here? Am I the only
          one? Two months ago I was in your
          shoes. Some punk holding a gun to an
          innocent girl. What should you do?
              


A GLINT sparkles in his eyes.   His teeth grind.    His gun GRIP


Teddy moves into position from the side!    Then...

The BUS BOY enters from the same door Teddy came in.     The
door BANGS closed behind him.

York spins, FIRES in that direction!

Teddy's HIT!   The Bus Boy retreats out the side door!



Dekker DUCKS away safely.

York drags the Pretty Waitress to the back!

Dekker runs over, checks on Teddy.





                  Shit.


                  I'm fine.    Go get him.

      Dekker looks her in the eyes, then darts away.



      Dekker exits the back.     Finds the Pretty Waitress.    Shook up.


                  Which way did he go?


                  That way.    Down towards the pier.



      York sprints across the street.        Dekker follows.



      HUNDREDS OF GIANT STEEL CARGO CONTAINERS litter the yard...
      makes the place look and feel like a GIANT MAZE.

      York disappears into the steel maze.

      Dekker enters, slows to a walk. Carefully proceeds forward.
      Gun drawn. Second guessing each turn.


                  You've really screwed yourself...
                  Jenkins is going to expect these kind
                  of results from you everyday.


                  FBI's got a team of 40 computer
                  technicians figuring out Lei's virus.
                  They'll break it.

      Dekker rounds a corner...


                  Your conviction would be admirable, if
                  it wasn't just so sad.

      At the far end of the container, York FIRES!

      Dekker ducks back.

      York takes a look out, doesn't see Dekker.





                 Get it through your head... The
                 calvary ain't coming. No heroes are
                 coming to save the day. The bad guy
                 gets away at the end of this story.

      Dekker peers around the corner... York's gone.


                 But I'll give you credit... You turned
                 out to be quite the little thorn,
                 didn't you?

      Dekker speed-walks, continuing the search.


                 I think Conners would be sorry that you
                 died. But not me.

      Dekker stops, eyes a full 360. The containers all look
      alike. Dekker wonders if he's just going around in circles.
      Until...

      BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS RICOCHET ALL AROUND DEKKER!         He
      dive-rolls for cover as...

      ON TOP OF A CONTAINER... York UNLEASHES, until... CLICK!        Out
      of ammo.

      Dekker, hearing this, pops up, RETURNS FIRE!

      York leaps off the backside of the container!

      Dekker gives chase. As he circles the container... no York.
      Instead, he finds a DOCK.



      A narrow wooden dock. There's a few small boats, A TUG BOAT
      and at the end... A SEAPLANE.

      Dekker approaches the tug. Each step slow and deliberate.
      EYES TRANSFIXED on the seaplane.

      As he nears the Seaplane... A SHADOW RISES from BEHIND HIM.
      From on top of the TUG BOAT!

      Dekker turns just as...

      York throws a fishing net on top of Dekker.    As Dekker
      struggles in the net, HIS GUN DISCHARGES!

      York with a PIKE POLE in hand, leaps down, CLUBBING Dekker
      over the head with the weapon. Dekker goes down!




      Dekker's gun SLIDES off the dock, into the water.

      York charges Dekker with the PIKE POLE, ready to stab,
      when...

      At the last second... DEKKER ROLLS AWAY! THE PIKE POLE
      BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground
      beneath the water.

      Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs.        He
      falls to the planks.

      York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he
      wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM.

      Dekker struggles to breathe.    York SQUEEZES harder.


                 I have come this far...      I will not be
                 denied.

      Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind
      York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two!

      Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.

      York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.       Still choking.

      Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!

      York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE!
      He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...

      ... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!    The Pike punches through his
      chest... POPS out his back!

      York, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker.
      Then go dead.

      Dekker steps close.   Holds a cold, remorseless stare at
      York's body.





      Lights Flash from the AMBULANCES AND POLICE CARS. A
      HELICOPTER HOVERS overhead. Karen Cross interviews Jenkins.



      Teddy, arm in sling, and Dekker sip on some already cold
      coffee.





          We used to spend all day   Sunday just
          reading in bed. I would    read the paper
          and he would read one of   his billion
          books. I didn't deserve    him. I knew
          that. But I still loved    him.

Teddy stares out the window...

POV OF TEDDY - Jenkins speaks to Karen Cross.


          He's the only man I ever loved.
              
          Did we all get shot today?

They can't help but laugh.


          They said in the city I'd be busy.
          Every day like this?


          Pretty much.


          Great.    I wonder what's next?


          For me...    a long vacation.

Teddy excuses herself to the bathroom.      Dekker goes to pay
the check.

AT THE CASHIER...   Dekker reaches for his wallet, opens it.


          How much?


          Do you think I'm going to charge you
          after all that? Go on.


          Thanks.

Dekker notices the tip jar by the register. He removes a TEN
DOLLAR BILL, about to stuff it in the jar...

That's when THE SMELL hits him. A strange, but familiar ODOR
comes from Dekker's wallet or more accurately... The TEN
DOLLAR BILL! But what is it?








      Marnie explains to Dekker and Conners...


                 Do you smell that?


                     
                 What is it?


                 When evidence is taken in, any physical
                 mark might effect the ability to lift
                 prints, so, to mark it, we spray it
                 with a scented solution.

      Off of Conners' LOOK.





      Dekker realizes it's the same smell, but how did this ten get
      in his wallet?





      Conners and Dekker get to know one another...      The Waitress
      lays down the check.


                 Anything else, officers?



      Conners drops a TEN DOLLAR BILL on the table.



      Dekker SCOOPS UP Conners's TEN, PUTS IT IN HIS WALLET and
      drops a twenty down on the table.





      Dekker, a million thoughts spiral at once, runs from the
      diner!

      Teddy exits the ladies room, but Dekker is gone.






       PAPERS and BOOKS litter the floor.

       Dekker trashes the place, looking for a clue of any kind. He
       rifles through the bookshelves, cabinets. All to no avail.

       That's when he finds... a medium-sized paperback, dog-eared
       and worn. The title of the book... "CHAOS" by James Gleick.

       Dekker flips through the book. Pages are marked, high-
       lighted. Key words we find include, "EDWARD LORENZ, CHAOS






       Dekker holds the "Chaos" book in his hand, paces...


                      
                  You tried them all?/ Nothing for
                  Conners or Lorenz?/ I don't know.        No,
                  maybe he's not on a flight.

       Dekker then notices - the book.     The author's name.


                  Try again.     But try Gleick.   James
                  Gleick.





       Early morning TRAVELLERS converge.



       Dekker scans the line up of people.      Nothing.



       A MAN, 40's, in DISGUISE , SPIES Dekker.          He picks
       up a CELLPHONE, DIALS... DEKKER'S CELLPHONE RINGS.           He
       quickly picks it up.


                  There's a passage in the Surangama
                  Sutra which, roughly translated means:
                  "Things are not what they appear to be:
                  nor are they otherwise."





                 Conners?

      Dekker again scans the line -- he's not there.         He scans all
      the faces AGAIN, but still nothing.


                 Think about that a minute... Doesn't
                 that blow your mind?
                     
                 What gave me away?


                 Ten bucks.


                 At the diner. That's right...       Well,
                 to err is human.

      Dekker SPOTS A MAN ON A CELLPHONE, he runs up to him, SPINS
      HIM AROUND, BUT... It's not Conners.


                 Was it Harry that gave him up?


                 Harry and the phone call. He called
                 me, said Callo was insignificant.
                 Threw up a red flag.


                 That wasn't him. That was my mistake.
                 I called you.







      Conners on his phone, with attached Voice Modulater.


                 I didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve
                 it.



      Dekker at his car... On the phone, listens.       But on this
      ends it sounds like...





                  Callo was insignificant...






                  York always thought "the plan" was
                  flawless. He was cocky. I told him
                  you have to leave room for error. You
                  can't always predict how it's all going
                  to play out. A random camera catches
                  an image of Richards, the scent on the
                  money... you. You were the biggest
                  wrench of the day. The Chaos Theory...
                  When you got that... I was impressed.


                  All day long, we were trying to find
                  out who the inside source was... it
                  was you.


                  The more information you gather, from
                  as many sources as possible, no matter
                  how unpleasant the methods are, the
                  better. And while I'd like to take
                  sole credit it was a team effort.


                      
                  Teddy's pretty devastated about your
                  death.


                  She'll get over it.





      Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of
      time!

      DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!      Vincent breaks his fall.

      Conners FIRES TOWARDS THE DOOR!      After...

      Conners takes out a small remote detonator.     Pushes the FIRST











      ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE. It
      runs from the wall into the vent. Teddy follows it into THE



                 Gas.   Get out of here!    Get out of here


      The fuse comes out of the vent... IT'S LIT! THE OVEN...
      HEAR the gas emission... The spark. The Gas.





      Conners leans over Galt, a giant GASH across his head, feels
      for a pulse. He's dead. Conners looks into the hallway,


      Conners gets up, and reaches INTO THE BATHTUB, drags out... a
      CORPSE, HOOKS HIS BADGE ONTO THE CORPSE'S BELT and lays him
      on the floor.

      Conners QUICKLY opens a LAUNDRY SHOOT, SHIMMIES INSIDE AND




      Conners lands safely on a mattress he left on the floor.
      Once settled, he pushes the SECOND BUTTON ON THE DETONATOR
      and...







      Conners opens a trunk, inside is a FIREMAN'S RAIN COAT,






      In the aftermath of the fire...      SEVERAL FIREMAN, POLICE,
      REPORTERS, etc. are on scene.




      Dekker and Teddy don't see... A FIREMAN PASSES BEHIND THEM,
      turns his head slightly, REVEAL THROUGH THE VISOR IT'S






      Dekker continues his search for Conners all to no avail. He
      TURNS HIS BACK, just as... A MAN WALKS RIGHT PAST DEKKER



                 So the corpse in the morgue with your
                 name on its toe...?


                 Scott Curtis won't be bothering anyone
                 again.


                 You're a serial killer.


                 Who got killed? Curtis? Harrington,
                 Galt, Lei. They're all hoods. The
                 world's safer with them gone. The kid
                 at the bank... that was unfortunate.
                 But... you live with your decisions.
                 You choose to take this road... there
                 is no half way. It's all or nothing.
                 That's why others fail. They don't
                 make the commitment. I won't make that
                 same mistake.


                 You said they were all hoods...     what
                 about, Callo?


                 Callo deserved his fate.      It's his fault.


                 This is Callo's fault?


                 If it weren't for him, York and I
                 would've never done this. One random
                 act, causes another, causes another,
                 and in the end... the pattern emerges.
                 That's the Chaos Theory.
                     
                 It's after six. The money's cleared.
                 I'm a wealthy man. Lei, for all his




                   CONNERS 
         evil, was one smart sonofabitch. The
         Feds will be tracing false leads for
         weeks.


         Lei... you tanked his trial on purpose.


         They should've suspended me after I
         testified. What did they expect?


         And because the "bitch that made her
         career off you" worked for Channel Two,
         that's why American National was the
         target.


         Everybody who screwed us, got screwed.
         Everything in its right place.


         Why not kill me? You had plenty of
         opportunities.


         This wasn't about killing, Shane. This
         was about standing up for what matters.
         Besides... you kinda grew on me.


         You're not going to get away.


         I already have. I'm not even here now.
         This is a very valuable lesson for you
         to learn, and it's good to have learned
         it early.


         What's that?


         You don't always win.


         All your years of service for not.
         You're a hypocrite.


         I'm an opportunist. I would've gladly
         died in the line of duty, but they took
         that away. If they had been as
         faithful to me, as I to them none of




                           CONNERS 
                 this would've happened. The system
                 broke down. Good luck, Detective. It
                 would've been an interesting
                 partnership, but I have to go now.

      As Dekker continues his search, his cellphone CUTS OFF!


                 Conners?   Conners?

      Dekker doesn't notice... THE MAN walks past security and out
      of the Western Airlines terminal.



      CONNERS walks through the small area, proceeds out to...



      Conners walks down the aisle, finds his seat.


                 Good morning, Sir. I'll let the
                 Captain know we're ready.

      She hands him a glass of champagne.


                 Will there be anything else?


                 No thank you. I'm fine.



      The private plane TAKES OFF!
