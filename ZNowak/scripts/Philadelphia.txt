MAIN TITLES PLAY OVER THIS SEQUENCE which culminates in a






TITLE: "Philadelphia City Hall."


pour into City Hall, into...





Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying
an accordion file under his arm like a football.

Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP.

Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time




making a racket...

Jamey rushes toward a door marked "JUDGE TATE."

RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers:


                    This construction site is
                    causing mortal and irreparable
                    harm to an unsuspecting public!


                    My client has one of the finest
                    and most respected safety records
                    in the business, Your Honor!

Jamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO

.


                    One at a time. Mr. Miller?


                    Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp.
                    began construction, the
                    surrounding residential
                    neighborhood has been enshrouded
                    in a cloud of foul-smelling,
                    germ-carrying, pestilent dust.
                    My client is being forced to
                    breathe known carcinogens daily!
                    Other residents are coming forth
                    on a daily basis to add their
                    voices of outrage!


                    Your Honor, I submit there were
                    no complaints until Counselor
                    began knocking on doors,
                    drumming up business. And the
                    dust, which Counselor refers to,
                    has appeared on only three
                    occasions. Each time it has
                    been examined and the results...

Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs
a document into Andrew's hand.


                    Limestone. Messy, but innocuous.

Andrew submits the report to the Judge.


                    Innocuous?


                    Defined by Webster's as harmless.


                    I know what it means. Your
                    Honor, imagine how the children
                    in this neighborhood have been
                    made to feel. The pounding of
                    construction ringing in their
                    ears as this skyscraper, a
                    tribute to mankind's greed,
                    grows daily, casting an ominous
                    shadow over their lives, filling
                    them with dread even as they are
                    surrounded in a black, toxic
                    fog, blocking out the sun while
                    poisoning their lungs! And
                    Counselor calls it harmless?!

His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to
Jamey: "Not bad." But he whips around, serious again:


                    Your Honor, Counselor is
                    attempting to portray my client
                    as a hideous manifestation of
                    evil and corruption. But
                    nothing could be further from
                    the truth. Rockwell has
                    generously contributed ten
                    thousand dollars to this
                    neighborhood's schools, clinics
                    and youth centers! Granting a
                    restraining order on the
                    construction site will throw
                    hundreds of Philadelphians out
                    of work, and will lend
                    validation to this contemptible
                    and groundless nuisance suit,
                    which speaks directly to the
                    kind of greed and treachery that
                    today is threatening the very
                    fabric of our society.

Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.


                    Let's not go off the deep end,
                    gentlemen. I thought we were
                    talking about some dust.




joined by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside  ...

As soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro-
cassette recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite
corner of the elevator, .


     ... plaintiff seeks to re-     ... whereas decedent had
     strain defendants from con-    pre-existing asthmatic

                                    sequent death...

Andrew and Joe stop at the same time, look at each other...

And turn toward the corner, seeking privacy.


     ... plaintiff's permission or  ... complainant seeks
     authorization...               relief...

There's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe pull out their
portable telephones at the same time.

They look at each other: which phone is ringing?


                    You.

Andrew resumes his telephone conversation.


                    Right.
                         
                    Miller.

The ELEVATOR OPENS: Andrew breezes past the MAN ON
CRUTCHES, saying to Joe:


                    Client of yours?


                    Funny.

Andrew hurries down the corridor. Joe waits a moment... then
pursues the MAN ON CRUTCHES.


                    Excuse me..? Sir? Yo!



ANDREW EKERGES FROM CITY HALL, ONTO DILWORTH PLAZA BUSTLING with


... DARTS into the street, hailing a cab.




Andrew hopping out, stuffing papers into his briefcase


RUSHING to the door marked "Dr. Roberta Gillman, Internal
Medicine."

Coming out is a YOUNG ASIAN MAN with a cotton ball taped to
the inside of his elbow.




 in a cheerful room... some, like a UPS
DELIVERY MAN, are attached to IV's, some sit with arms
extended, waiting to be hooked to an IV by TYRONE, a BLACK


CAMERA FINDS ANDREW sitting quietly, with an IV drip running
into his arm. Andrew is wearing a Walkman, the source of
the CLASSICAL MUSIC, and he's reading a legal brief. Most
of the people in the room look SICKER than Andrew.

DIALOGUE CAN BE HEARD under the CLASSICAL MUSIC (although
MUSIC dominates the SOUNDTRACK).


                         (slapping a thin
                         PATIENT'S wrist)
                    Gonna have to start looking for
                    veins in your feet, sweetheart.

DR. ROBERTA GILLMAN, passes through, speaking to Andrew:


                    Andy. Can you stop at my office
                    on your way out?


                    Sure.

Andrew is distracted by A HISPANIC MAN across the room,
rolling up his sleeve for an IV -- his bare arms, hands,
face and neck are marked with PURPLE BLOTCHES.

Andrew closes his eyes, concentrating for a moment on the
CLASSICAL MUSIC... then goes back to work.









skyscraper in downtown Philly, at the end of the work day


Andrew pushes through glass doors into the plush "Wheeler
Building," pressing through the tide of WORKERS headed home.




CLERK  to the elevators, at the sedate,
expensively appointed offices of Wyant Wheeler Hellerman
Tetlow and Brown  ...


                    ... up to Tax, on fourteen, and
                    get right back, I need you.

Andrew BLASTS out of the elevator, flashing Anthea a four-
star smile. They stride down the corridor together.


                    Just the dazzling paralegal I
                    wanted to see.


                         
                    I know what that means, and the
                    answer is no. I have a class
                    tonight. Exploit someone else.
                    And since you've asked ...

They pass a silver-haired partner, KENNETH KILLCOYNE.


                    Solid work on the Rockwell
                    situation, Andy. Top-notch.


                    Thanks, Kenneth.
                         
                    Your exam!


                    Thank you. 98. I gotta go...


                    Ninety-eight?! Ninety-eight!

Andrew reaches the secretaries' station. A cheerful
secretary, SHELBY, shoves documents at him.


                    Conference call's up. They just
                    started the roll call. Here's
                    the settlement agreement, the
                    red-lined copy's on your desk.
                    Need me in there?


                    No. Great. Thanks, Shelby.
                         
                    It's 6:30, go home.

Andrew passes a colleague on her way out, RACHEL SMILOW:


                    Rach.


                    I'm late, I have to pick up Amy
                    from her afterschool but I want
                    to talk to you about that Hansen
                    thing.


                    Catch me later, I'll be here.
                    And tell Amy, I love her
                    painting, it's on my wall.

Andrew SAILS toward his office.





... DROPPING the documents on his desk, SCANNING them.

... ADMIRING a child's painting taped to the wall.

... PUNCHING into the speaker phone on his desk.

The , REVEALING A TELECONFERENCE OPERATOR:


                    ... Karen Hargreave, representing
                    Lloyd Management Corporation?

The : Andrew, the OPERATOR, and
HARGREAVE 


                    Present.

As the OPERATOR continues the roll call, the SCREEN
CONTINUES TO SPLIT and HARGREAVE is replaced by a SERIES OF
LAWYERS in offices around the country, 
saying "Present" while in  section of the screen...

... Andrew dials a number on another telephone line,


                    Andrew Beckett, representing
                    Saunders International?

Andrew punches into the conference call


                    Present.

The  is now joined by SARAH BECKETT, a
suburban, 60ish American MOM, in her backyard garden,
answering a portable phone.


                    Hello?


                    Hi, Mom. It's me.

The LAWYERS are into the conference, in  portions of
the screen, (their VOICES HEARD underneath Andrew's
conversation with his mother).


                    Andy! This is a nice surprise.
                    How are you, hon?


                    I'm fine.


                    What's Dr. Gillman say?


                    Hold on, Mom.
                         (punching into the
                         conference call)
                    There's no way my client will go
                    along with that.


                    Who's this?


                    Andrew Beckett. Hi, Karen. I'm
                    sorry I interrupted...

He punches out of the conference, back to his Mom (glancing
over his shoulder to make sure the door is ).


                    Gillman says I'm fine. My blood
                    work is excellent. T-cells are up.
                    Just a sec ...
                         
                    Yes, I think that would alleviate
                    most of our concerns.
                         
                    My platelets look good too.


                    Are you on one of those conference
                    calls? I hate when you put me on
                    hold.





TITLE: ""





Andrew's fingers FLY across the keys of a notebook computer.

Needing a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from
the computer... opens a reference book... grabs a carton of
Chinese food... (NOTE: The library may be equipped with a
computer terminal which Andrew uses for reference, rather
than a book.)

Andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks, finding a
relevant citation:


                    Ah hah! Yes!
                         
                    Rentworth v. Pennsylvania...

                    wrongful interference with
                    prospective economic
                    relations...

A SHADOW falls across Andrew. He IGNORES IT.

ANGLE: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON says:


                    Look at this fucking guy. He's
                    an animal.

Andrew's hands DO NOT LEAVE the keyboard.


                    Walter.

The SECOND MAN steps forward, a silhouette becoming visible
This is BOB SEIDMAN. He and Kenton wear tuxedos.


                    Are we interrupting, Andy?


                    In a word, Bob...


                    Charles is right behind me.

ANOTHER SILHOUETTED FIGURE APPEARS. This image has a
horror-film feeling to it.

Andrew WHIPS AROUND to face them.


                    I was just about to take a
                    break. Good evening, Charles.

CHARLES WHEELER, also in tuxedo, remains in shadow.


                    Andy? Could you step into my
                    office for a sec?
                         
                    I feel like firing someone
                    tonight.

Andrew throws an arm over Seidman's shoulder.


                    We're gonna miss you around
                    here, Bob...




MAN, waiting for clearance from a SECURITY GUARD, on
Andrew's dim and quiet floor, WATCHES AS...

Seidman, Kenton and Andrew follow Charles Wheeler up a wide,
carpeted staircase. Wheeler finishes a story and everyone







                    Andy's expressed a keen interest
                    in the Kronos Inc. situation,
                    Charles. Is that correct, Andy?

The lawyers have gathered in Wheeler's spacious office, with
its floor-to-ceiling view of the Philadelphia skyline.


                    The fate of the participants
                    interests me, yes sir.

Wheeler, Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of
preparing cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass
clip, rolling them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the
cigars in and out of their rounded mouths.

Andrew, holding a cigar but NOT preparing to light it, watches
with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye.

Wheeler leans back in his chair, swirling a brandy snifter.
He exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure.


                    It's good to be King, hey
                    Charles?


                    Kings are out of fashion. I'd
                    rather be thought of as a
                    benevolent tyrant.
                         
                    It's an anti-trust action.


                    It is, and it isn't, Charles.
                    Macrosystem's new software
                    copies all the best-known
                    elements of Kronos' spreadsheet
                    program. If they're allowed to
                    sell it, Kronos will get undersold
                    right out of business. For me, the
                    legal principle, involved is
                    copyright infringement.


                    Bearing in mind that Bill
                    Wright, the chairman of
                    MacroSystems, is a close, personal
                    friend of mine... which side of
                    this mess would  desire to be
                    on, Andy? And don't allow my very
                    tight, personal relationship with
                    Bill to influence your answer in
                    any way.

Andrew knows this is a test. And he loves it.


                    Sorry, Charles, but...

Andrew is distracted -- BY A LIGHT FALLING ACROSS HIS FACE.


                    I'd like to see Kronos win.

Walter Kenton has shifted a lamp, so that its LIGHT FALLS
ACROSS ANDREW'S FACE, REVEALING: a faint purple blotch
about the size of a quarter, much like the blotches we saw
on the HISPANIC PATIENT in Andrew's doctor's office.


                    Why, Beckett?


                    Because they deserve to, Walter.

Andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed
back, revealing the blotch.

He stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to
cover the blotch.


                    If MacroSystems wins, an energetic,
                    young company will be destroyed,
                    five thousand Americans will be
                    out of work. Moreover, the laws of
                    copyright and anti-trust were
                    enacted to prevent exactly the
                    kind of bullshit Macrosystems is
                    trying to pull.


                    Andy, do you know who reps Kronos
                    Inc.?


                    Bailey, Brackman.


                    Get with the program, Andy. As
                    of this evening, about 8:05 this
                    evening, right after the soup
                    course... Kronos Incorporated is
                    represented by Wyant Wheeler
                    Hellerman Tetlow and Brown. Or,
                    more specifically, senior
                    associate Andrew Beckett.

A moment before it sinks in, then: Andrew clenches his fist
in a victory salute.


                    Yes!


                    You'll have to get right on it,
                    Andy, we're up against the
                    statute of limitations.

An ASSOCIATE LAWYER in shirtsleeves taps on the office door.


                    Tokyo on four, Bob.


                    Great. Excuse me, fellas.
                         (picking up a phone,

Andrew offers his hand to Walter Kenton.


                    Thanks, Walter.


                    What's that on your forehead,
                    pal?


                    Whacked with a racquetball.
                         
                    I appreciate your faith in my
                    abilities.


                    Faith, Andy, is the belief in
                    something for which we have no
                    evidence. It doesn't apply to
                    this situation.
                         
                    Go home. I mean, get back to
                    work.

Andrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment.


                         
                    Thanks, Charles.

                    No sweat, buddy.

Smiling, Andrew exits the office.






away from Wheeler's office , then...

... DOING a JOYFUL END ZONE DANCE, running in place the way
football players do when then score a touch down, saying
"Yes! Yes! Yes!" to himself, soundlessly.

The SOUND OF CLANGING METAL interrupts Andrew: HELENA, a
maintenance worker is emptying a trash can. She's seen his
little dance and starts to laugh.

Smiling, Andrew puts the unlit cigar into his mouth, WINKS
at Helena and says:


                         (in a funny, kind of
                         medieval way)
                    It's good to be King.





TITLE: ""




Andrew's loft -- INT./DAY) 

It's a mirror image. The BLOTCHES vary from the size of a
dime, to the size of a half-dollar. He looks awful.

A YOUNG, BLACK WOMAN'S FINGER applies makeup to Andrew's
face, trying to cover the blotches. This is his friend



                    You want to apply the foundation
                    as evenly as you can, Andy. You
                    don't want to look like you've
                    thrown it on with a spoon.


                    Uh huh.

CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING Andrew sitting at a table in his
loft, a towel around his neck, protecting his shirt from makeup.
Chandra applies the makeup gently, supervised by another friend
named ALAN. (Andrew's loft has been turned into a lawyer's
command post: stacks of books, documents, etc.). A third friend,
BRUNO, sits in the corner, flipping through channels on the TV.


                    Okay. You try.

Andrew tries applying makeup to his face.


                    Chandra? Don't you think this
                    color's a little... orange for me?


                    Tahitian Bronze works best on
                    lesions.


                    Think of it as the "I just back
                    from Aruba" look.

IN THE BACKGROUND: Andrew's fax machine receives a fax in
Andrew's "work area": desk, personal computer, etc.).


                    I got it.

Bruno removes the fax from the machine, walking it over to
Andrew, handing Andrew the fax, while munching an apple.


                         (giving the fax
                         a quick scan)
                    Thanks, Bruno.
                         
                    I've been out of the office four
                    days. I don't want them to
                    think I've been to the beach.
                         
                    Okay. Check this out.

Andrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell
frames, meant to help conceal the blotches.


                    Hides everything, right? What
                    do you think?


                    You know who you look like,
                    Andy? That actor, in that
                    movie. Not the one where he was
                    autistic, the one where he
                    dressed up like a lady on a soap
                    opera...


                    Dustin Hoffman.


                         
                    Tootsie!


                    Right.


                    You want to try Light Egyptian?

Suddenly, Andrew winces, gripping his gut.


                    What?


                         
                    Excuse me a sec...

Andrew starts out of the room -- suddenly HAVING TO RUN.


                    Just like my cousin Fredo.

CAMERA HOLDS ON Chandra, Alan and Bruno. SOUND OF BATHROOM DOOR
slamming shut.

Bruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom
door.


                    You okay, Andy?





Andrew rests his head against the wall, sweat covering his
face. A storm of fire has passed through him, and he's hoping
it's over for now.


                    I think I need to go to the
                    hospital.

Hospital . He hustles up the ramp toward the
Emergency Entrance...




Emergency Room , FINDING 

ANDREW sitting on a gurney, holding a cotton ball against
his arm, where blood has been drawn, wearing a blanket over
his shoulders, fighting chills.

Chandra and Bruno are waiting with Andrew. They exchange
quick hugs with Miguel and Andrew, ad libbing greetings and
goodbyes.


                    Thanks, you guys.


                    Yeah. Thanks, guys.

Miguel puts his arms around Andrew.


                    Gillman's out of her office today.
                    I  her to take a day off, and
                    she did, can you believe it? Did
                    you get someone to cover your
                    class?

Miguel touches Andrew's face, checking for fever.


                    Don't worry about it. They took
                    blood? A specimen?

Andrew holds an empty specimen cup.


                    Aren't you giving an exam?


                    I said, don't worry about it.

Miguel places a gentle kiss on Andrew's sweaty forehead.


                    You got a fever, baby.

Suddenly, the facade cracks and TEARS STING Andrew's eyes.


                    I almost didn't make it to
                    the bathroom, Miguel. I almost
                    lost control right in front
                    of everybody.


                         
                    So what? It's nothing to be
                    ashamed of. You have nothing to
                    be ashamed of, okay?

Andrew pulls himself together, brushing aside tears, in
control of his emotions once more.


                    Wait, here's my guy... Hey!

Andrew catches the attention of a harried INTERN, whose
surgeon's greens are covered with blood.


                    Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...


                    About my blood work?


                    We're waiting...

Miguel opens a small notebook, making notes.


                    ... meanwhile, I'd like to
                    prepare you for a colonoscopy,
                    so we can take a look inside.


                    Sounds delightful.


                    Why do you need to do this?


                    Who are you?


                    Who are you? Doctor... ?


                    This is my partner. We keep
                    records of hospital visits.
                    Nothing personal.


                    Dr. Klenstein.
                         
                    It's not a pleasant procedure,
                    but if the KS is causing the
                    diarrhea, we ought to know right
                    away.


                    It could be parasites, an
                    infection...


                    A reaction to AZT...


                    That's possible, but.


                    He's not going through some
                    painful procedure until we've
                    cancelled out everything else.


                    I'm trying to help your
                    "partner." You're not a member
                    of his immediate family, I could
                    have you removed from the ER.


                         
                    He's upset, he's sorry.


                    Don't apologize for me.


                    He's not sorry, okay, fine.
                         
                    Why don't we see what we find
                    out from the blood work? I'll
                    work on getting a specimen, I'm
                    sure hospital food could help in
                    that direction. Maybe, by then,
                    we'll hear from my doctor, and
                    we'll go from there. Okay?
                    Everybody happy?


                    Allright. I'll get on the lab
                    about the blood work.


                         
                    I'm sorry.

The INTERN walks away. Andrew's BEEPER BEEPS.


                    That's the third time. I better
                    call the office.
                         
                    Would you relax, please?


                    I am relaxed.

Andrew HOBBLES toward a pay phone, outside a VISITOR LOUNGE,
where weary relatives are watching TV.

Andrew drops a quarter into the phone.


                    "If you or someone you know..."

ANDREW'S POV ON TELEVISION: Joe Miller on the screen, with the
words "Negligence... Malpractice... Auto accidents"... and in
the background, PHOTOS of MAIMED, BURNED, INJURED CLIENTS.


                    "... has been injured through
                    the fault of others, you may be
                    entitled to legal remedy...

Andrew LAUGHS. Then, his call is answered:


                    Shelby? It's me. Jamey's been
                    beeping me, I... Okay, okay,
                    calm down. Put Jamey on.




, GRABS THE PHONE when Andrew's intercom BUZZES...


                         
                    Andy?! This is a disaster! We
                    can't find your revisions on
                    the Kronos complaint!


                    Slow down, Jamey, for Christ's
                    sake!


                    I went down to Word Processing
                    to pick up the corrected copy,
                    but  said you haven't
                    delivered the corrections.
                    I told them you've been working on
                    it at home, and...

Andrew forgets his physical pain, this is more important.


                    I brought it in last night, around
                    midnight. It's in my computer.


                    What did you file it under?

Jamey puts his hands on Andrew's computer keyboard.


                    K-R-O-one.

Jamey types the file name.


                    Jamey, I don't have to mention,
                    do I, that we're up against a
                    statute of limitations on this
                    complaint which runs out in...
                         
                    Seventy-five minutes.

Jamey stares dumbfounded at the computer monitor.


                    It's not here, Andy.

Andrew closes his eyes. He can't believe this.


                    You go down to Word Processing
                    and tell those motherfuckers
                    they better come up with that
                    complaint,  Or they are
                    ! You tell them that
                    comes from me!

Andrew SLAMS the phone into its cradle.

He pauses, takes a deep breath, and says to himself:


                    Every problem has a solution.
                    Every problem... has... a...
                    solution.

Calmer, Andrew returns to the gurney, putting on his shirt.


                    Every problem has a solution...

Miguel approaches with tea purchased at the canteen.


                    Why are you getting dressed?


                    You're not going to like this.
                    Please try to smile...

Andrew puts his arms around Miguel.


                    Thanks for leaving school, and
                    coming here, and...
                         (pulling back, putting
                         on his jacket)
                    I will be back. An hour, tops.


                    You're going to the office?!


                    You're not smiling.

Andrew rushes toward the exit doors.


                    You're leaving the hospital?
                    You're going into the office
                    looking like that? Are you
                    insane?


                    One hour!


                    Drew!


                    I promise!








Building, heading for the entrance  ...

But he changes his mind, darting to the corner of the block.

Andrew stops to buy a baseball cap from a VENDOR.

He trots down an alley, past bags of garbage, entering the
building through a garage door.




an emergency stairwell  ...

Andrew passes CAMERA, out of breath. He's wearing the ball cap
PULLED TO HIS EYEBROWS to hide blotches on his forehead.



ANDREW OPENS THE FIRE DOOR ON HIS FLOOR AT WYANT WHEELER, removing
the ball cap, baring the purple blotches. 

He walks quickly down the hall. Passing a COLLEAGUE, Andrew
pretends to scratch his face, attempting to hide the blotches
as nonchalantly as possible.

He dashes past an office, ignoring Anthea.


                    Didn't expect to see you... ?

He ducks into his office.




through papers  ...

Startled when he sees Shelby, Andrew spins toward the wall.


                    I'm looking through the files but...


                    Call the messenger service, have
                    someone standing by...
                         
                     phone.


                    Sure.

Andrew keeps his face averted, until she's out of the room. He
goes to his computer, the monitor already glowing.


                    Think. You brought the discs in, you
                    transferred...

Rachel comes into his office.


                    I thought I was supposed to be
                    covering for you.
                         
                    God, Andy, you look awful.


                    Fucking Word Processing lost my
                    Kronos complaint. Which must be
                    filed by fucking five o'clock!
                    If it's late, there's no case...
                         
                    Every problem has a solution.


                    What can I do?


                    Get down to Word Processing.
                    Help Jamey look.

She rushes out.

Andrew begins shoving floppy discs into the slots on his
computer, bringing up each disc's directory.


                    No.

He throws the disc to the floor. Shoves in another.

Shoves in another, bending it in half.


                    No, goddammit!

He pulls open a file drawer, dumping legal briefs onto the
floor, frantically spreading them around with his foot.

Andrew THROWS a document across the room, takes a breath.

He picks up the telephone.


                    Bob? Something's come up. With
                    Kronos. I don't want to
                    upset Charles, but...
                         
                    Oh, shit, Bob, the complaint's
                    due in forty minutes and I can't
                    find it.
                         
                    No, you don't have to come...
                         
                    Great. Fucking great.

Andrew rubs his eyes, this is a nightmare.

He switches off the overhead light. He slants the window
blinds, filling the room with shadow

Bob Seidman comes into the office, typically cheerful.


                    C'mon, Andy, you didn't lose
                    anything...

Seidman is struck by the mess in the office, and Andrew's
disheveled appearance.


                    Jesus.


                    I don't know what to do, Bob.


                    You'll never find it in the dark.

Seidman FLIPS ON the overhead light. Andrew flinches.

Seidman approaches. Andrew gives up trying to hide the
purple blotches, facing his mentor straight on.


                    What in God's name... ?


                    Bob...


                    What's wrong with your face?


                    What's wrong with my face? You
                    want to know what's wrong with
                    my face? I've got a skin
                    condition. Next question, Bob?
                    No more questions? Fine. Now
                    can you help me find the complaint?


                    Allright. Calm down.


                    Sorry...

Seidman sits in front of Andy's computer.


                    What was the file name?


                    K-R-O-one.


                    Maybe you mistyped the name when
                    you were saving it. We'll try
                    combinations of those letters...

Seidman goes to work. Andrew leans over his shoulder.


                    You're right, I probably just
                    misfiled...


                    Andy?

Walter Kenton is standing at Andrew's door. His demeanor is
casual. So casual it seems a little forced.


                    Some sort of problem?

Andrew has kept his face averted. But now he TURNS DIRECTLY
TOWARD CAMERA, showing his face to Kenton.


                    Yeah, Walter. Yeah. Some sort of
                    major problem.








                    There she is, okay. You can relax
                    now, Lisa.

LISA MILLER has just given birth to a baby girl. She
collapses on her pillow, gasping for breath, moaning in
pain, quietly crying a little.

At Lisa's side, Joe fumbles with a camera while darting
amazed looks back and forth between Lisa and the baby.

He's frantic.

                    Give me the camera, Joe.

Lisa pops the film into the camera, hands it back.

With wildly trembling hands, Joe begins SNAPPING PHOTOS.

                    I misplaced an important

                    I was diagnosed with AIDS eight
                    months ago. During a bout of
                    pneumonia. I recovered quickly
                    and was back at work in ten
                    days. Since I was doing so well
                    on the AZT, we decided against
                    telling anyone about it.


                    We?


                    My lover and I.

                    Miguel Alvarez. We've lived
                    together for nine years.


                    Continue.


                    I dove back into work,
                    everything was fine. Until the
                    lesions started...

covers the blotches. (NOTE: PICTURE and ANDREW'S VOICE OVER

                    First on my leg. Then my
                    forearm, my back. Then... my
                    face. For a short period, I
                    avoided the office during the
                    day, waiting for the chemo
                    therapy to clear up the
                    lesions...




                    But I never let anything slide.
                    I made all my calls from home.
                    I worked sixteen hour days on a
                    complaint for a 350 million
                    dollar copyright infringement
                    suit.




                    But the day the complaint was
                    due, it disappeared. Erased
                    from my computer. I thought I
                    was losing it, mentally...

                    AIDS dementia when it gets into
                    your brain. But miraculously, a
                    copy of the complaint was
                    located at the last minute, and
                    we got it to court on time...





                    The next morning, I was called
                    to the office for a meeting with
                    the managing partners. Walking
                    down that corridor was strange.
                    Felt like everyone was staring.

                    Of course.

Bob Seidman CANNOT look directly at Andrew.


                    Andy. Before we begin, I'd just
                    like to say: everyone in this
                    room is your friend.


                    You're in trouble.

(NOTE: Joe IS SEEN IN HIS OFFICE, or LEANING AGAINST A
WINDOW IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM whenever he speaks.)


                    I know that, Charles.


                    More than your friend. Family.


                    Big trouble.


                    Charles, I must apologize again,
                    for the Kronos mishap.
                         
                    It was a scary few minutes
                    around here. Wow. But thank
                    God, the complaint was found.
                    And no damage was done.


                    This time. What about next time?


                    There won't be a next time, I
                    guarantee it.


                    Andy. It seems that something
                    has come over you, lately: A
                    kind of... stupor, a fogginess,
                    a lack of focus... Earth to
                    Andy. Anybody home?


                    Helloooo...


                    That's right, Andy. The last
                    four, five months you've seemed
                    really out of it...


                    At least... different, somehow.


                         
                    Perhaps... you're right. I've
                    certainly been busy. With the
                    Kronos complaint, a preliminary
                    injunction hearing and the
                    Saunders trial all falling at the
                    same time...


                    Some people think you have an
                    attitude problem, Beckett.


                    Really? Who thinks that, sir?


                    I do.

Wheeler seems very grave.


                    I had no idea there was a concern
                    in that area. Hey:
                         
                    I'll get to work on it right away.

NO ONE else smiles.


                    We've been talking it over, Andy.
                    Your future that is... We feel that,
                    because we respect you so much, we
                    have to be honest with you.


                    Honesty is always best.


                    Do you really think so, Andy?


                    Yes, Bob, I do.
                         
                    Excuse me? Am I being fired?


                    Let's put it this way, Andy:
                    your place in the future of this
                    firm is no longer secure.


                    In a word, yes.


                    We don't think it's fair to keep
                    you here, where your future is
                    limited. But we wish you luck,
                    Andy, all the luck in the world.

Wheeler rises, wearing a friendly smile.


                    And I hate to rush you out of
                    here, but...


                    But he's got lots of other
                    people's lives to ruin...


                    ... we've got a committee meeting.


                    Excuse me, Charles. With all
                    due respect... this is...
                    preposterous! It doesn't make
                    any sense, it sounds as if we're
                    talking about someone else.
                    Pardon the lack of humility, but
                    I've had the distinct impression
                    I was kind of... one of the
                    rising stars around here. And I
                    feel that wasn't just my
                    imagination. And I also think I
                    deserve to know what's really
                    going on here, Charles.


                    Oh, you're right, Beckett, you
                    don't have an attitude problem.


                    Take it easy, Walter.


                    If you'd lost confidence in me,
                    why did you give me the Kronos suit?


                    I hoped the challenge would
                    improve your performance. You
                    could say it was a carrot.


                    A carrot?!


                    I buy that.


                    As in, the vegetable?


                         
                    Andy, you nearly blew the case,
                    for God's sake! That alone is
                    inexcusable. It would have been
                    catastrophic for us. Put
                    yourself in our shoes, Andy.
                    There's no coming back from an
                    error like that, regardless of
                    who you are!
                         
                    I'm sorry, Andy.

Andrew FREEZES -- the full nature of this situation hitting
home. He looks each of the PARTNERS in the eye...


                    Uh huh... Okay... I see...

... at last LOOKING DIRECTLY AT Wheeler's secretary Lydia,
whose pen is poised above her notebook, waiting for someone
to say something.

Wheeler breaks the silence.


                    Good luck, Andy.

Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Seidman and Lydia file out.

Andrew doesn't move.

A SECURITY GUARD enters the room.


                    Who are you?


                    I'm here to escort you to your
                    office so you can organize your
                    belongings.






                    Okay. Explain to me like I'm a
                    two year old, because there's an
                    element to this I can't get
                    through my thick head: Didn't
                    you have an obligation to inform
                    your employer you had this
                    dreaded, deadly, infectious
                    disease?

Andrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short, to
disguise the effects of chemo.


                    The law says people with
                    disabilities cannot be
                    terminated, so long as they can
                    perform the duties required by
                    their position...


                    Okay, okay... They discover you
                    have this horrible, disgusting,
                    terminal illness, and they
                    panic, for any number of
                    perfectly valid reasons.
                    They're frightened for
                    themselves, their families...
                    Maybe it's the homo angle.
                    Maybe they don't want to rub
                    elbows with someone who's just
                    popped out of the closet with a
                    terminal case of acne. And how
                    do they explain your status to
                    the client for Chrissake?


                    Joe, from the day I arrived to
                    the day they fired me, I
                    performed consistently,
                    thoroughly and with absolute
                    excellence. And if they hadn't
                    fired me, that's what I'd be
                    doing today.



                    Okay... They want you out. It's
                    against the law to fire you for
                    having AIDS, so they make you
                    look like a fuck up. Which
                    leads us to the mysterious, lost
                    file.


                    They sabotaged me.


                    I knew you were going to say
                    that. I don't buy it, and I
                    don't see a case.


                    Look. I know I have a case. If
                    you don't want to take it for
                    personal reasons...


                    Correct. I don't.

Andrew rises, thoroughly business-like.


                    Thanks for your time.


                    Beckett? I'm sorry about...
                    what's happened to you. It's a
                    fucking kick in the head.


                         
                    Don't send flowers, Joe. I'm
                    not dead yet.

Andrew exits.







                         (still uncomfortable,
                         as Andrew's leaving)
                    Have a nice day.

Andrew nods, passing one of Joe's colleagues, a hustler
named FILKO, who STARES SHAMELESSLY.

Joe approaches Iris's desk.


                    Find out if Armbruster can see
                    me this afternoon.


                         
                    What the hell's wrong with him?




. CLOSE ON ANDREW, standing there as an endless flow of
people passes by. He watches them go, thinking...







                    You had contact with someone who
                    has AIDS, and you're worried.






                    I'm not worried. What are you doing?

Joe sits in his shirtsleeves on the examining table.


                    Checking your blood pressure,
                    relax.

The DOCTOR wraps the blood pressure unit around Joe's arm.


                    I didn't have contact. What do you
                    consider "contact?" We were sitting
                    in the same room, three, four
                    feet... What if you shake hands?
                    Wait. I know the answer. Only sex,
                    or sharing needles. 
                    We didn't shake hands, anyway.

Dr. Armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump,


                    The HIV virus can only be transmitted
                    through the exchange of bodily
                    fluids, namely blood and semen.


                    Right.

Joe begins rolling down his sleeve.


                    Leave that.


                    Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they
                    keep finding out new things about
                    this disease? So you tell me, today,
                    there's no danger, and I go home,
                    and I hold my baby, and six months
                    from now I hear on the news: "whoops!
                    We were wrong.' You  carry it on
                    your clothes, your skin, and now I've
                    got to worry about my kid. What
                    are you doing?

Dr. Armbruster has been preparing a syringe.


                    We're going to draw blood.


                    Why are we going to do that?


                    Joe. I don't care a whit about your
                    private life.


                    You want to give me an AIDS ?!

Joe HOPS off the table.


                    The guy sat in my office! You can't
                    get AIDS that way, right?


                    Right.


                    It doesn't travel through the
                    air, by breathing, or touching,
                    right?


                    Not by touching, or shaking hands,
                    or hugging, using the same toilet...
                    Even kissing someone with AIDS is
                    safe. But it there's something in
                    your past you're worried about...


                    Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an
                    AIDS test. Are you crazy? But
                    thanks for the information. Really.

Joe throws on his jacket, opens the door... then TURNS BACK:


                    In my past?


                    IV drug use.

Joe shakes his head.


                    A homosexual encounter.


                    Get real.


                    Unprotected sex with a prostitute.


                         
                    Uh.... No. Not really.


                    Or unprotected sex with someone you
                    didn't know very well, any time
                    during the last twelve years.



Joe returns to the examining table, and rolls up his sleeve.






                    You have a problem with gays,
                    Joe.






                    Not especially.

Lisa eats standing up, at the stove, while Joe walks the
BABY in their modern kitchen.


                    How many gays do you know?


                    How many do you know?


                    Lots.


                    Who?


                    Karen Berman. Aunt Teresa. My
                    cousin Tommy who lives in
                    Rochester. Eddie Meyers from the
                    office. Joe Cantwell, he's one of
                    the partners. His lover, Greg.
                    Stanley, the guy who's putting in
                    our kitchen cabinets.

For a moment, Joe is struck dumb. Then he says:


                    Your Aunt Teresa is gay? That
                    beautiful, sensuous woman is a...
                    ?


                    Duh...


                    Since when?


                    Probably since she was born.


                    Allright. I admit it: I'm
                    prejudiced. I don't want to work
                    with a homosexual. You got me.


                    Okay, Joe...


                    I mean, two guys, doing the
                    horizontal thing? I don't get
                    it. Don't they get confused?
                    "Is that mine? I thought it was
                    yours." Hey, call me old
                    fashioned, call me
                    conservative... I think maybe
                    you have to be a man to get just
                    how nauseating the whole basic
                    idea really is.


                    Fine, Joe.


                    And the way they work out,
                    pumping up, so they can be macho
                    and faggot at the same time... I
                    can't  that shit. Now I'm
                    being totally honest with you.


                    That's perfectly clear.




                    Would you take a client if you
                    were constantly thinking: "I
                    hope this guy doesn't touch me.
                    I don't even want him to 
                    on me?"

books and legal pads, hard at work. He's eating a pastrami
sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN
saunters by  ...

A CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE:

Andrew taking a seat across the room (the blotches have been
reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold). Andrew
removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a
package of tissues, blowing his nose.


                         
                    Shit...

Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or
eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him.



Andrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes
something. Sneezes.

A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew.


                    This is the supplement. You're
                    right, there is a section on...
                         
                    ... HIV related discrimination.


                    Thank you.

Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains.


                    We have a private research room
                    available.


                    I'm fine, thanks.

Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching.


                    Wouldn't you be more comfortable in
                    a research room?


                         
                    No. But would it make you more
                    comfortable?


                    Whatever, sir.

The LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating
she's done all she can do.

As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks
up his books and moves away.

Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye
on Andrew, who concentrates on his work.

Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just  to be
sauntering by. Suddenly he "notices" Andrew.


                    Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'?


                    Fine.

Andrew goes back to his work.


                    Who'd you get?


                    What?


                    Find a lawyer?


                    I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?


                    Huh? Oh. Great. She's great.


                    What's her name?


                    Rayisha.


                    Rayisha. Very nice.

Andrew focuses on his work. Joe steps away.

Joe comes back.


                    How did they find out?


                         
                    One of the partners spotted a
                    lesion on my forehead.

Nearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she
hears the word "lesion."


                    Uh huh...

Andrew concentrates on his work once more.


                    How do you get from one lawyer
                    spotting a lesion, which could
                    have been a bruise, to the
                    partners deducing you had AIDS
                    and basing a decision to
                    terminate you on that
                    conclusion?

The CHINESE PROFESSOR moves away.


                    Good point.

Andrew removes a legal pad with "KENTON" written in big
letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath.


                    The partner who spotted the
                    lesion, Walter Kenton, used to
                    work for Benton, Myers, in D.C.
                    There's a paralegal there, Maria
                    Torres. She's had lesions on
                    and off for three years. She
                    says it was common knowledge
                    around the office that her
                    lesions were caused by AIDS.


                    They didn't fire her?


                    No. They didn't fire her.

Andrew goes back to his work. Joe stands there.


                    So Kenton connected the... lesion,
                     whatever suspicions he had about
                    your personal life... to this
                    woman, Maria... and blew the
                    whistle on you. Suddenly you're
                    losing files, and it's time to
                    let you go. But, up to this
                    point, you've been their Golden
                    Boy, their rising star... Their
                    behavior is... inconsistent.


                    Thank you.

Andrew goes back to work.


                    There is no relevant precedent.


                         
                    Arline decision. Supreme Court.


                    Arline?

Andrew SHOVES the legal book toward Joe.

CLOSE ON ANDREW'S HANDS  on the book's white
pages.

The book is still  Andrew. If Joe wants to read it,
he'll have to turn it around.

Joe looks at Andrew's hands. A MOMENT.

Joe turns the book around, begins to read:


                    "The Federal Vocational
                    Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits
                    discrimination..."





                    "... against otherwise qualified
                    handicapped persons who are able
                    to perform the duties required by
                    their employment..."





                    "Although the ruling did not
                    address the specific issue of
                    HIV and AIDS discrimination..."

 Andrew and Joe face each
other at their table, but NO ONE ELSE remains at that table,
or at the table next to it...


                    "Subsequent decisions have held
                    that AIDS is protected as a
                    handicap under law, not only
                    because of the physical
                    limitations it imposes..."

DISSOLVE TO A SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER (DAY IS TURNING INTO
NIGHT): Joe pacing, Andrew reading. Their section of the
library is COMPLETELY EMPTY but for Andrew and Joe.


                    "But because the prejudice
                    surrounding AIDS exacts a social
                    death which precedes the actual,
                    physical one..."

 Andrew and Joe sit on the
same side of the table, reading the same book.


                    "This is the essence of
                    discrimination: formulating
                    opinions about others not based
                    on their individual merits but,
                    rather, on their membership in a
                    group with assumed characteristics...

The library is QUIET. Andrew SNEEZES.

Joe scoots his chair away from Andrew by eight inches.






MUSCULAR, SWEATY MALE BODIES  INTO EACH OTHER, sounds of
GRUNTS, skin SLAPPING against skin  ...

... Hand SLAPPING a butt under satin shorts

... Sweaty armpits... the ROAR OF A CROWD...

... BASKETBALL PLAYERS embracing, twirling each other around, high
fiving...

WIDE ANGLE REVEALS: A basketball game in progress, Sixers
versus the Celtics in Philly's Spectrum Arena.

 ROBERT PARISH going for a lay-up...


                    Watch this guy! Nail him! Ouch!

Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Kenneth Killcoyne, Bob Seidman
and SEVERAL LAWYERS and SPOUSES watch the game from a plush,
private box, complete with TV, bar, snack table. The lawyers wear
Ralph Lauren polos, chinos and ball caps. The place reeks of
cigar smoke. Walter Kenton has a twentyfive year old WIFE.

Charles Wheeler's nine year old GRANDSON sits nearby.
Wheeler turns the GRANDSON'S ballcap around, smiling
lovingly at the boy.

JUST BEYOND WHEELER: The door to the box is opened by a SECURITY
GUARD and a well-dressed, charismatic MAN looks in.


                         
                    Julius!


                    Dr. J.!


                    Gentlemen... Ladies...

JULIUS ERVING enters, greeted by the LAWYERS.


                    How's it goin', Doctor?/This is
                    an honor!/etc ...

The door is opened again, by the SECURITY GUARD, REVEALING
Joe Miller  and a MARSHALL.


                    Excuse me. Charles Wheeler?

Wheeler turns. Joe SLAPS a document into Wheeler's hand.


                    Summons. For you.

NOW the box is QUIET.


                    Say. What's up, Chuck?




Stadium  where Wheeler walks beside Bob Seidman,
with Walter Kenton and Kenneth Killcoyne just behind. SOUNDS
OF THE GAME STILL IN PROGRESS can be heard, but FAR AWAY.
Occasionally the lawyers are passed by FOOD SERVICE or LAUNDRY



                    ... interview every employee,
                    support staff, associates, partners.
                    Did  of them know Andy was sick?
                     did they know? Did he tell them?
                    Did they notice something was wrong
                    with his appearance? None of this
                    information got to the managing
                    partners. We know that. Make sure
                    everyone else does too... And
                    Beckett: I want to know everything
                    about his personal life. Did he
                    frequent those pathetic bars on
                    Camac Street?


                    Jesus.


                         
                    What about other homosexual
                    facilities, whatever they are?


                    Charles...


                    What deviant groups or
                    organizations did he secretly
                    belong to?
                         
                    What is it, Bob?!


                    Let's settle with Andy and put
                    this whole tragic mess behind
                    us.

They arrive at a quiet, semi-private cul de sac.


                    Andrew brought AIDS into our
                    offices, into our men's room.
                    He brought AIDS to our annual
                    goddamn family picnic.


                    We ought to be suing him.


                    For Christ's sake, where's your
                    compassion?


                    Compassion? Andy sucks cocks,
                    Bob. He takes it up the ass.
                    He's a pervert.

Only Seidman shows any kind of REACTION.


                    That's kind of... extreme, Walt.
                    Andy's private life is none of
                    our business.


                    Bob. You're trying my patience.
                    Andrew Beckett is making his
                    private life our business. We
                    gave him Kronos. Did he say,
                    "I'm sick. I might not be able
                    to see this through?"


                    He was doing a great job.


                    Bob. I must ask you to shut the
                    fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say
                    "I might not be able to serve our
                    clients to the ?"
                    He said nothing. And now, Andrew
                    Beckett proposes to haul me into a
                    court of law, to sling accusations
                    at me, in full view of the entire,
                    Philadelphia, judicial
                    establishment. My God.


                    Beckett doesn't want to go to court,
                    he's hoping for a quick tasty
                    settlement.


                    A jury might decide that Andy has a
                    case.


                    Wait a minute. The man was fired for
                    incompetence, not because he has
                    AIDS. You didn't know he was sick,
                    did you, Bob?


                    Holy Shit. Did you, Bob?


                         
                    No. Not really.

Wheeler walks away, followed by Kenton and Killcoyne.

Bob Seidman stands alone in this dark place.

                     ON A WORK DAY AS WE CUT TO:





JOB'S COLLEAGUE, FILKO, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA (in
Joe's offices, INT./DAY):


                    Charles Fucking Wyant Wheeler?!

Joe sweeps by, just arriving for work.


                    Morning, Filko.

Filko keeps pace with Joe down the corridor. ANOTHER
COLLEAGUE calls out from an office as Joe passes:


                    Hey, it's the local chapter of
                    the ACLU!


                    You're a Republican, Joe! You
                    belong to the NRA!


                    How many toilet stalls are there
                    in the women's restroom on this
                    floor, Filko?


                    How many... what?!

Filko follows Joe into Joe's office.


                    Two. How many toilet stalls are
                    there in the  room? Two,
                     four urinals. How many
                    wheelchair accessible toilets in
                     of those restrooms?
                    Zero. In this entire building?
                    Zero. Get the picture, Filko?
                    ! You find
                    yourself a female, paraplegic,
                    legal assistant who is qualified
                    to work here, except she can't
                    take a leak... and you've got
                    yourself a sex discrimination
                    suit  a handicapped
                    discrimination suit. Not
                    handicapped. What do you call
                    someone who can't use a normal
                    restroom? "Gastro-intestinally
                    challenged!"

Behind Joe, out a large window: PAINTERS on a scaffold.

Iris comes into the office and says:


                    Wyant Wheeler's asking for a
                    postponement on the prelim, Joe.

Joe is dialing the phone.


                    Low-life, sleazy scumbags. Of
                    course they want a postponement,
                    I've got a client with a terminal
                    disease. They're going to drag
                    their heels every step of the way,
                    the rotten bastards.

                    Is that spelled right?



EXTERIOR, JOE'S OFFICE BUILDING, WHERE PAINTERS ARE ADDING A new
question to the line of windows :




                    Hey, Beckett. This is Miller.




Andrew and Miguel's loft  


                    I just wanted to tell you...

CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH the loft, finding Andrew in the rooftop
solarium, sitting crosslegged in front of a candle.


                    ... we're trying to set a date for
                    the prelim. Hang in there.

Andrew's eyes are closed. Next to him rests a tape player. A
WOMAN'S VOICE IS HEARD, accompanied by NEW AGE MUSIC:


                    I can heal myself.


                    I can heal myself.


                    I can heal myself.


                    I can heal myself.




each other in bed  ...


                    I was coming out of the gym
                    today, and I ran into Jimmy. Do
                    you know what he asked me?
                    "What's it like knowing your
                    boyfriend's going to die?"


                    Jerk... What did you say?


                    I said, "Everyone's going to
                    die, Jimmy. But Drew's not
                    going to die of AIDS. There's a
                    cure around the corner, and he
                    plans to be around to take
                    advantage of it."

Miguel strokes Andrew's hair.


                    You got that right, Mikey...
                         
                    You still believe that, don't
                    you?


                    Yes. I think it will be a
                    simple solution. They'll put it
                    in a syringe, inject it into
                    your bloodstream. It'll
                    neutralize the virus. It'll
                    revitalize the immune system,
                    and people with AIDS will become
                    healthy again.

corridor TWO FIGURES WALK TOWARD CAMERA  ...

The figures APPROACHING CAMERA are Andrew and Joe, stepping
into and out of sunlight falling through tall windows.

TITLE: ""



A PHALANX OF LAWYERS -- at least ten -- APPROACHING CAMERA, a
bulwark of white shirts and dark ties.



Andrew's hair is short, but growing back, the blotches have
receded,his weight is up. He's in a stage of recovery.



Charles Wheeler  and Walter Kenton (he's
pissed) lead the battalion.

Behind them, walk young lawyers BELINDA CONINE and JEROME
GREEN. Belinda is white, Jerome is black.





A JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, with couches, soft chairs scattered in a
loose circle, like a casual living room.

Joe and Andrew whisper to each other. The Wyant Wheeler team
takes up several chairs. Belinda Conine and Jerome Green sit
next to Wheeler and Kenton. Some of their ASSISTANTS stand.

Wheeler is looking across the room at...

Andrew, who catches Wheeler's stare.


                    You're looking better, Andy.
                    How do you feel?

SILENCE. Everyone watches Andrew for his reaction.


                    Fine, thanks, Charles.

JUDGE LUCAS GARNETT enters his chambers (not wearing a
Judge's robe). He shakes hands with Wheeler and Kenton.


                    Charles, Walter...


                    Congratulations on the new
                    grandson.


                    Thank you. We're very happy.

The Judge brushes by Joe and Andrew without a word. The room
becomes SILENT as the Judge takes a seat.


                    Attorney for the plaintiff?


                    Joseph Miller, Your Honor.
                    Macready and Shilts Legal Services.


                    I've seen your television commercials.
                    "If you or anyone you know has
                    been injured through the fault of
                    others... It should say, "through
                    the  of others."


                    I'll take that under consideration,
                    Your Honor.


                    On behalf of the defendants?


                    Belinda Conine. Of Petersen,
                    Lehigh, Monroe and Smith.


                    And Jerome Green.

And a WASPISH lawyer wearing round glasses:


                    Dexter Smith.

A white-haired lawyer next to Belinda:


                    Ralph Petersen.


                         
                    You're outnumbered four to one.
                         
                    Whom do I address?
                    I can't talk to four lawyers at
                    once.


                    I'm chief litigator, Your Honor.


                    Fine. I've asked the litigants to be
                    present for this conference, in the
                    hope we can settle this matter
                    today, among ourselves... There is
                    nothing I hate more, than to see
                    lawyers suing each other. If you
                    look at the opinion polls, when Mr.
                    John Q. Citizen is asked to rank
                    professions according to the
                    respect he holds for them... Where
                    are the lawyers? Somewhere below
                    personal fitness trainers and only
                    slightly above child pornographers.
                    If we keep suing each other, if we
                    fail to settle the smallest
                    difference among ourselves with
                    mutual respect, if we continue to
                    scrap like bucks in heat, we'll
                    fall lower on that list. And when
                    people lose respect for lawyers,
                    they lose respect for the law. And
                    when this society loses all respect
                    for the law, we'll be murdered in
                    our beds, my friends, our cherished
                    institutions will be burned to the
                    ground and our children and our
                    grandchildren will live like
                    savages.


                    If it please Your Honor, we  to
                    settle this matter.


                    By God you  settle it! If you
                    force this case to trial, young man,
                    you'll regret it for the rest of
                    your natural-born days...
                    Now, Joseph. What would you
                    require to settle this matter
                    today?


                    Reinstatement at full salary.
                    Back pay covering the period of
                    unemployment and...


                    Hold it, Joe.
                         
                    He wants to come back to work,
                    Chuck.


                    That's impossible, Your Honor.


                    That's impossible, Joe.


                    If it please Your Honor, we're
                    prepared to offer a cash
                    settlement of twenty-five
                    thousand dollars.


                    Your generosity overwhelms me,
                    Belinda, considering my client
                    was earning over a hundred thou
                    when he was terminated almost six
                    months ago.


                    Give me a break, Joe. Let's cut
                    through these false attitudes.
                    Give them a figure. How much do
                    you want?


                    I  to go back to work, Your
                    Honor.


                    You're here at my indulgence,
                    young man. I'm waiting for a
                    figure, Joe.

Andrew and Joe confer with each other.


                    Based on what my client would
                    have earned over the next three
                    years, including benefits and
                    projected raises, and the
                    extraordinary cost of medical
                    care for someone with Acquired
                    Immune Deficiency Syndrome...
                    We would settle today for the
                    very fair amount of one million
                    five hundred thousand dollars.


                    Very good, Joe. Now, Belinda,
                    I've got a figure over here, of
                    one million, five. I...

Andrew WHISPERS to Joe, who interrupts the Judge:


                    One more thing, Your Honor...


                         
                    Any settlement agreement 
                    include, and this is critical,
                    a letter of exoneration, making
                    clear my termination had nothing
                    to do with the quality of my work.

Charles Wheeler WHISPERS to Belinda Conine.


                    Your Honor, Mr. Beckett's
                    incompetence nearly sabotaged a
                    350 million dollar suit.


                     was the one who was sabotaged.


                    We have complaints about Mr.
                    Beckett's lack of preparation,
                    his disorganization, his
                    arrogant, defensive attitude...
                    The list goes on.


                    We have letters.


                    Why haven't you produced these
                    letters?


                    Take it easy.
                         
                    What's the big deal, Chuck? The
                    boy wants a letter, to show to
                    his mother, for her to keep after
                    he's gone. Why are you being hard-
                    assed about this?


                    I wish I could exonerate you, Andy.
                    But I'd have to lie to do it.


                         
                    You can save it for the jury,
                    Charles. I want to hear you say,
                    under oath, in front of a judge and
                    a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.
                         
                    Gentlemen.
                         
                    Counselor.


                    Don't do this, Andy.


                    Whoa, whoa...
                         
                    What do you expect them to say,
                    you're Alan Dershowitz?


                    A trial takes , Beckett. Do
                    you know what I'm saying?


                    I think I catch your subtle drift,
                    Walter.

Andrew saunters out.


                    You'll be sorry, Beckett.


                    Andy, you don't want this.

Joe scans the room, all eyes are on him. His frown turns into
a grin. He faces the Judge.


                    With all due respect, Your Honor,
                    my client chooses to pursue his
                    constitutionally guaranteed
                    right to a trial.

Joe exits.




Colonial house in Downington, Pennsylvania  ...

Andrew walks toward the house, TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA.


                    This is the house where I grew up.
                    In Downington, Pennsylvania.
                         
                    See this... ?

The CAMERA POINTS to SEVERAL PAIRS OF CHILD'S HAND PRINTS in the
sidewalk, then, BACK TO ANDREW IN CLOSE UP, SMILING.


                    Those are my cute little hand
                    prints. And my brother's and my
                    sister's.



                    And today is... ?


                    Today is my parents' fortieth
                    wedding anniversary.

Andrew goes inside, speaking to the CAMERA:


                    This is the front door. I caught a
                    finger in this door, once...
                         
                    This one. Broke it.
                         
                    This is the hallway, my mother
                    calls it a foyer...



CHILDREN are running through the house, while WOMEN sporting
corsages confer in the kitchen. A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL jumps into
Andrew's arms.


                    Uncle Andrew!


                         
                    This is my niece, Alexis. Say
                    hello, Alexis.


                    Mommy's pregnant again.


                         
                    You heard it here first, folks.
                    News as it happens.

Andrew's older and very down to earth sister JILL, puts her
arms around Andrew, squeezing tight.


                    Hello, darlin'.


                    This is my sister, Jill, the most
                    fertile woman on the planet. She's
                    married to Reverend Jim.


                    You feel thin.
                         
                    Hello, Miguel.

As Jill leaves Andrew's arms, the CAMERA IS TRADED OFF TO
ANDREW, who SHOOTS JILL GIVING MIGUEL A HUG.


                    Hey, Jill. Nice to see you,
                    sweetheart.


                         
                    Handsome devil.
                         
                    Is he eating?


                    We don't discuss his weight.
                         
                    Do we?




                    And what will we find in... da duh
                    da duh da duh... the KITCHEN!

A GROUP OF LADIES  when CAMERA ENTERS KITCHEN.


                    There he is! Hi, Andrew! Don't
                    point that thing at me! etc...

Andrew's mother Sarah wears an unpretentious flowery dress.


                    Hi, Mom. How do you feel on your
                    fortieth anniversary?


                    Ancient. How do you think I feel?
                    Put that thing down and give me a
                    hug.
                         
                    Andrew, stop! ... He still
                    doesn't listen.


                    Where's Dad?


                    He's out in his shed showing your
                    uncle his new riding mower.

One of Andrew's YOUNG NEPHEWS SHOVES HIS FACE into the

Andrew and his immediate family are gathered in the den, sitting
quietly, facing each other. Andrew's father, BUD, with an
American flag pin in his lapel, sits next to Sarah. Jill holds
the hand of her husband, REVEREND JIM. Two of Andrew's brothers,
MATT and RANDY,  are there.

Andrew sits next to Miguel.


                    Things might be said, at the
                    trial, that... are not going to
                    be easy for you to hear. Things
                    about me, about my private life.
                    And I want to make sure it's
                    okay with everybody.


                    I appreciate you asking, Andy,
                    but really, it's your call.


                    What do you think, Jill?


                    To be honest, I'm worried about
                    Mommy and Daddy. They've had to
                    go through so much already...
                    And, we all know...
                         
                    There's going to be even worse
                    things to deal with, eventually.
                    I wonder if it's fair to put
                    them through this.

Andrew's father STARES at his folded hands.


                    Mom?


                    All I know is, you got through
                    your diagnosis fine, like a
                    trooper. But when they fired
                    you... you were so devastated,
                    Andy... I don't expect any of
                    my kids to sit in the back of
                    the bus. Fight for your rights.


                    Thanks, Mom... Dad?

There's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks.


                    Supposedly, the Lord doesn't
                    give you more trouble than you
                    can handle. But I'm having a
                    hard time believing that these days.

Andrew's construction worker brother, RANDY, wipes tears
from his eyes. Clearly their father is in alot of pain.


                    Andy, the way you've faced this
                    whole thing, you and Miguel, with
                    so much courage... your mother and
                    I have been so very impressed...

Andrew gazes at his father with incredible love. Miguel puts
an arm around Andrew.


                    I can't imagine there is anything,
                    that anyone could say, that would
                    make us feel less proud of you.


                         
                    Thanks, Dad. I love you guys. How
                    about you, Randy?


                    Hey. You're my kid brother, Andy.
                    That's the bottom line. I mean,
                    what are those bastards going to say?
                    You're gay? Shit, I knew that
                    when you were five years old.

Everyone LAUGHS. Andrew and Randy high five.


                    Wait a minute...
                         
                    You're ?

More laughter. But Jill speaks seriously:


                    What about you, Andy? You're not a
                    militant type. You've always
                    been so private.




                    I guess... I don't have time for
                    that any more.


                    Jim? Will you lead us in a
                    prayer?

Everyone bows heads, holding hands in a circle.


                    Dear Lord. Sometimes it is
                    difficult to remember to be
                    grateful...




                    To remember, in our times of
                    sorrow and confusion, that we
                    have You to turn to, and each
                    other. Bless and keep Andrew
                    and Miguel, dear Lord, deepen
                    and strengthen their love as
                    they face the struggles that lay
                    ahead. Bless and watch over all
                    of us, fill us with Your love,
                    Your light, and Your peace,
                    which passeth all understanding.
                    In Jesus' name, we pray...


                    Amen.

                    You are presented with a simple

                    You will hear two explanations for
                    why he was fired. Ours. And
                    theirs...

Joe crosses the courtroom, coming to stand in front of...

ANDREW, whose appearance has changed: thinner, paler than we've
ever seen him, some blisters on his lips. But the most disturbing
thing about his appearance is the way he moves, slowly, like a
much older man. He's taking notes (which he will do
relentlessly throughout the trial.) And he has a cane at his
side, which he'll use throughout the trial.


                    It's up to you, to sift through
                    layer and layer of truth, and
                    determine for yourselves the
                    version that sounds the  true.

JUDGE GARNETT presides from his bench.

Among the spectators, Miguel sits next to Sarah, and
Andrew's sister Jill. AIDS ACTIVISTS in the background.


                    There are certain points in our
                    version, that I must prove to
                    you... Point number one: Andrew
                    Beckett was... is a brilliant
                    lawyer. A great lawyer. Point
                    number two. Andrew Beckett,
                    afflicted with a debilitating
                    disease, made the legal,
                    understandable, personal choice
                    to keep the fact of his illness
                    to himself... Point number three:
                    His employers discovered his
                    illness. And ladies and gentlemen,
                    the illness I'm referring to, is


Joe pauses, letting that sink in.


                    Point number four. They panicked.
                    And, in their panic, they did what
                    most of us would like to do with
                    AIDS... Get it, and the people
                    who have it, as far away from us
                    as possible.

Joe walks away from Andrew.


                    The behavior of Andrew Beckett's
                    employers may seem reasonable to
                    you. It does to me. After all, AIDS
                    is a deadly, incurable, disease...




                    But however you come to judge the
                    behavior of Charles Wheeler and
                    his partners in moral, ethical,
                    human terms... When they fired
                    Andrew Beckett because he had
                    AIDS, .

With a swift, direct glance at the Judge, Joe speaks with
considerable power and emotion:


                    And, when lawyers break the law,
                    when this society loses respect
                    for the law, when that day comes,
                    our cherished institutions will be
                    burned to the ground, and our
                    children and grandchildren will
                    live like savages.






                    Fact. Andrew Beckett performed
                    at a consistently mediocre
                    level. Fact. He made a grievous
                    error on a multi-million dollar
                    lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is
                    the victim of lies and deceit.
                    Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his
                    employers, going to great efforts
                    to conceal his disease from them.
                    Fact. He was successful in his
                    duplicity. The partners at Wyant
                    Wheeler did  know Andrew
                    Beckett had AIDS when they fired
                    him...

Belinda pauses in front of the plaintiff's table


                    Fact. AIDS is a tragedy...

Andrew looks directly at Belinda.


                    Fact. Andrew Beckett is dying.

Joe watches Andrew for his reaction.


                    Fact. Andrew Beckett is angry.
                    Because his "lifestyle," his
                    reckless behavior, has cut short
                    his life... And in his anger, his
                    rage, he's lashing out. And he
                    wants someone to .




large insurance company, MR. LAIRD  ...


                    Andrew Beckett represented your
                    company in a lawsuit in 1990, is
                    that correct?


                    Wyant Wheeler represented us.

Andrew glances toward the jury box: the MARINE JUROR writes in a
tiny notebook.


                    But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of
                    litigation for the suit.


                    That's correct.


                    Were you pleased with his work?


                    We were satisfied.

Joe and Andrew exchange a LOOK -- Laird's response surprises and
disappoints them.


                    Were you satisfied, or were you
                    pleased?

Laird glances toward Charles Wheeler before answering.


                    We were satisfied.

Joe refers to legal documents.


                    Mr. Laird, when I approached you
                    about being a witness at this
                    trial, and you agreed, you gave
                    sworn testimony in a deposition.
                    Is that correct?


                    That's correct.


                    According to the deposition, you
                    said you were "thrilled, impressed,
                    overwhelmed" by the quality of
                    Andrew Beckett's work. Do you
                    remember saying that?


                    I may have said something like
                    that. But that's not how I feel at
                    this moment.

Joe takes on a street-tough tone:


                    Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to
                    me like I'm a four year old: Did
                    Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit
                    for you or not?


                    We won.


                    Did that thrill, impress and
                    overwhelm you?


                    It satisfied me.

Joe STARES at the guy.


                    It's a long way between being
                    overwhelmed and being satisfied.
                    A cheeseburger may be satisfying
                    whereas caviar and champagne and
                    roast duck and baked Alaska for
                    dessert might be considered
                    overwhelming. Do you agree?


                    I might.


                    Five months ago you characterized
                    Andrew Beckett as caviar and now
                    you're calling him a cheeseburger.
                    Your standards have shifted a
                    great deal, and I'd like to know
                    why you've changed your mind.


                    Since that time I've devoted more
                    thought to the subject, and that's
                    how I feel now.






                    Partner Robert Seidman was the
                    supervising attorney for your
                    lawsuit?


                    That's right.


                    Does the supervising attorney guide
                    the litigating attorney during
                    the trial?


                    Often, he does.


                    As far as you know, in the handling
                    of your lawsuit, Andrew Beckett was
                    simply following orders.


                    That's a fair assessment of the
                    situation.

Andrew glances over his shoulder: at Robert Seidman, who
meets his gaze.

                    compensation for being fired.

                    "This case is sending a cold chill
                    through the legal community. One of
                    Wyant Wheeler's key clients, the
                    Grace Foster Foundation, which
                    supports several AIDS charities,
                    has taken its business to another

As the TV DRONES ON, CHARLIE THE COP, OTHERS GLARE at Joe.


                         
                    Hey, Joe.
                         
                    You're not starting to get a
                    little... light on your feet
                    here on us, are you?

Joe does not laugh.


                    Yeah, Filko. I am.
                         
                    I'm on the prowl, Filko. I need
                    a man. Not just any man. I need
                    a hunk. A hunk like you. How
                    about it, Filko? Want to play
                    sailor? This time, I'll be first
                    mate and you can be Columbus.


                    Chill out, Joe.


                         
                    Those people make me
                    sick, Filko! But a law's been
                    broken, okay? The . Remember
                    the law?

CHARLIE THE COP has relaxed a bit.


                    At least we agree on one thing,
                    Joe... They make me sick too.

HOLD ON JOE, but WE HEAR THE TV REPORTER in the BACKGROUND:


                    "... now the public knows that
                    your son has AIDS and he's gay.
                    How does that make you feel?"

All eyes turn to the TV: SARAH BECKETT IN CLOSE UP.


                    "This is a world full of war,
                    famine, poverty, homelessness...
                    and people make a fuss because
                    two men or two women want to
                    live together, or make love.
                    Seems kind of silly, doesn't
                    it?"

The bar ERUPTS with a CHORUS OF BOOS AND CATCALLS.






                    And Walter Kenton knew the
                    lesions on your face and arms
                    were caused by AIDS?

The witness: MARIA TORRES, Hispanic, 35, healthy-looking.


                    Definitely. People were going
                    around, whispering things. I
                    figured I didn't have anything
                    to lose, so I told all the
                    partners.


                    How did Walter Kenton treat you,
                    after you told him you had AIDS?

CLOSE ON KENTON, looking confident.


                    Every time he came into contact
                    with me, he'd get this look on
                    his face. I called it, the
                    "Oh God" expression. As in "Oh
                    God, here comes that woman with


Andrew LAUGHS.


                    Ms. Torres? Have your employers
                    fired you for having AIDS?


                    No. When I need time off, for
                    medical reasons, we work it out.


                    Thank you. No more questions.

Jerome Green rises.


                    Miss Torres. How did you contract
                    the AIDS virus?


                    During a transfusion. I lost
                    a lot of blood giving birth to my
                    second child.


                    In other words, in  case
                    you happen to be an innocent
                    victim of the AIDS tragedy.


                    Look. I'm no different from
                    everyone else who has this
                    disease: I'm not guilty, I'm
                    not innocent. I'm just trying
                    to survive.






                    Beyond noticing the marks on
                    his face, were there other
                    things about his appearance
                    that made you suspect he had


THE WITNESS: Paralegal Anthea Burton.


                    He was losing weight. He looked
                    kind of tired sometimes. But he
                    was working so hard... Still, I
                    felt something was wrong.
                         
                    And I can't believe 
                    saying they didn't notice
                    anything.


                    Objection.


                    Just answer the question.


                    Sorry.


                    Ms. Burton. You're black.


                    Is that a question?


                    No. Have you ever felt
                    discriminated against, at Wyant
                    Wheeler?


                    Yes.

Wheeler shakes his head, disgusted. Kenton fumes, outraged.
Seidman looks surprised.


                    In what way?


                    Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's
                    secretary, Lydia, told me Mr.
                    Wheeler had a problem with my
                    earrings.


                    Your earrings?

Anthea is wearing large, dangling African-style earrings.


                    Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt
                    they were too... "ethnic" is the
                    word she used. She said he
                    would like it if I wore
                    something smaller, less garish,
                    and... more "American."


                    What did you say?


                    I said my earrings  American.
                    They're African-American.


                    Thank you. No more questions.

Belinda Conine approaches Anthea.


                    Miss Burton? Do you still work at
                    Wyant Wheeler?


                    Yes.


                    Were you recently promoted?


                    Yes. I'm now in charge of the
                    paralegal department.


                    Thank you.








cold medicines, carrying a box of Pampers  ...

A YOUNG MAN in grass-stained sweats, carrying a football under
one arm, buying a tube of toothpaste, speaks to Joe:


                    How's the trial going? It's
                    a great case.

Joe looks up surprised. The YOUNG MAN smiles.


                    I saw you on television. I'm a
                    law student. At Penn.

Joe is flattered by the YOUNG MAN'S interest.


                    Good school. What year?


                    Second.


                    Great.


                    Would you like to have a drink
                    with me? I just finished a
                    game, I could use a beer.
                         
                    I don't pick up people in drug
                    stores every day.


                    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you
                    think... ? You think ...
                         
                    ... gay?


                    Aren't you?


                    What's the matter with you? Do
                    I look gay to you?


                    Do I look gay to you? Relax.


                    Relax? I ought to kick your
                    faggoty little ass for you!


                    Take it as a compliment. Geesh.

But Joe is really upset. People are watching.


                    Don't you know this is exactly
                    the kind of bullshit that makes
                    people hate you guys?


                    Fuck you! You want to kick my
                    ass? You want to try?
                         
                    Asshole.


                    You're the asshole, buddy.


                         
                    Get a life.

Joe stands there, holding the Pampers, people STARING.




around her desk, really upset (One year-old Rayisha sits on
the desk playing with wooden salad spoons.)  ...


                    But what was it?! What was this
                    guy thinking... ?!


                    Don't know, Joe.


                    Is there some kind of expression
                    I've picked up from Beckett?!
                    Some kind of fairy attitude I've
                    unconsciously adopted?! Am I
                    walking different?! Some kind
                    of vocal thing?! Have I picked
                    up some kind of homo ?!


                    Have you changed your aftershave?


                    Very funny. I had a box of
                    Pampers under my arm for
                    Chrissake!




almost completely obscured by shadow  ...

They speak softly, careful not to wake the baby.


                    Joe?


                         
                    Yeah... ?


                    Two men making love... ? Now
                    tell me again...  is that
                    disgusting?


                         
                    Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking
                    his dick in another guy's mouth?
                    It's disgusting.

They lie in silence for a moment. Then:


                    Okay, so... help me with this
                    one, Joe... Is it disgusting for
                    someone to put his dick into
                    someone's mouth? Or, is it
                    disgusting for someone to take
                    a dick into  mouth?


                         
                    Great, Lisa. Thank you.






                    "But, ultimately, the complaint
                    was found, wasn't it?






                    Yes. We found a copy. It been
                    incorrectly filed...

ANGLE ON THE JURY: Several JURORS write in notebooks like the
Marine's; he's been handing them out...

Joe seems ill at ease today, a little off his game. When he
glances at Andrew, it's with irritation.


                    Has a file ever disappeared like
                    that before? Vanished into thin
                    air, all of a sudden, only to
                    reappear in the nick of time?

Jamey answers nervously:


                    I've never known that to happen
                    before. No.


                         
                    Did you have something to do
                    with this file being lost
                    accidentally-on-purpose?


                    Objection!


                    I'll rephrase.
                         
                    Did you have anything to do with
                    this file being... misplaced?


                    Absolutely not.

Joe stands, staring at Jamey. Too long. Jamey squirms.


                    Are you a homosexual?


                    What?!

Joe pressing forward, toward Jamey.


                    C'mon, Mr. Collins. Are you
                    homosexual? You know, gay?

The COURTROOM ERUPTS: ACTIVISTS booing Joe, Wheeler's crowd
expressing OUTRAGE, JURORS looking confused.

Andrew takes in the commotion, as the JUDGE BANGS HIS GAVEL.


                    Hold it, hold it!

Andrew trains his attention on Joe.


                    Objection! Where has this come
                    from?! Suddenly Counsel is
                    attacking his own witness. Mr.
                    Collins' sexual orientation has
                    absolutely no relevance to this
                    case.

                    Mr. Miller. Could you kindly share
                    with me exactly what's going on
                    in your brain, because I don't
                    have a clue at the moment.

Joe faces Andrew, also curious to know what Joe's up to.


                    Your Honor, everyone in this
                    courtroom is thinking about sexual
                    preference, sexual orientation,
                    whatever you want to call it.
                    They're looking at me, and
                    wondering about it...
                         
                    They're looking at Mr. Beckett, and
                    wondering about it. They're looking
                    at Mr. Wheeler and wondering about
                    it. They might even be looking at
                    you and wondering about it. So,
                    let's get it out in the open. Let's
                    talk about what this case is really
                    about: the general public's
                    hatred... our loathing, our  of
                    homosexuals.

DEAD SILENCE while the Judge thinks it over.




                         
                    Very good.













CLOSE ON JAMEY COLLINS, sweating bullets on the stand.


                    In this courtroom, Mr. Miller,
                    justice is blind. To matters of
                    race, creed, color, religion.
                    And sexual orientation.


                    With all due respect, Your Honor...
                    We don't live in this courtroom,
                    do we?


                    No. We don't... However, as
                    regards this witness, I'm going to
                    sustain the defense's objection.





The MARINE JUROR, the RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR, and AN
UPTIGHT BUSINESSMAN JUROR stand at the urinals, with an empty
urinal between each of them. The MARINE JUROR whistles while
he pees  The
BUSINESSMAN sighs, "Ahhhhhh."

The RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR jingles change.

The ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR enters, stepping up to the urinal
between the BUSINESSMAN and the MARINE. He unzips, and it seems
to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary
organ. This does  escape the MARINE'S notice.


                         
                    I have some gay friends. What's
                    the biggie?

The MARINE says nothing.


                    Everybody has a couple of gay
                    friends. Don't you?


                    No, sir. I do not.

The MARINE moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see
his private parts.


                    You might have them, and just
                    not know they're gay.

The MARINE shakes, zips, flushes, turns away. He pauses to look
directly at the ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR.


                    I know.






                    And how many weeks at a time
                    would you be out to sea, without
                    stopping at port?


                    Anywhere from two weeks, to
                    several months.


                    Any women on board?

Kenton glances at the MARINE JUROR.


                    Not when I was in the Navy.


                    So during those long voyages,
                    months at a time, out to sea, no
                    women in sight, a hundred,
                    hardworking, robust, young men,
                    in the prime of their life, at
                    the peak of their natural
                    appetites, desires, their god-
                    given, hormonal ...
                    Anything going on?


                    Going on... like...? 


                    Like... two sailors playing hide
                    the salami.

Andrew covers his face with his hands.


                    Objection!


                    Mr. Miller!


                         
                    We had one guy like that.


                    You haven't ruled on my
                    objection, Your Honor.

Kenton seems eager to tell his story. Joe stands with
crossed arms, waiting.


                    Let's continue.


                         
                    You had one guy "like that?"


                    Yeah. But we took care of him.


                    How did you do that?


                    We stuck his head in the
                    latrine, after ten of us had
                    used it.

LAUGHTER and SOME APPLAUSE from some SPECTATORS, and some
JURORS. ACTIVISTS BOO and HISS.

The JUDGE POUNDS HIS GAVEL.


                    You taught him a lesson.


                    Yes, we did.


                    Like firing Andrew Beckett
                    taught  a lesson?


                    Objection!


                    I'll withdraw.
                         
                    You were aware, when you worked
                    with Maria Torres, that she had
                    AIDS, correct?


                     didn't try to conceal it.


                    So you are aware of the
                    difference between a lesion and
                    a bruise, is that correct?


                    I  the difference. That
                    doesn't mean I'm always able to
                    recognize the difference.


                    But didn't you avoid contact
                    with Ms. Torres, after you found
                    out she had AIDS? She says you
                    acted repulsed by her and you
                    avoided her, is that correct?


                    I felt, and still feel, nothing
                    but the deepest sympathy and
                    compassion for people like
                    Maria, who have contracted this
                    terrible disease through no
                    fault of their own.




into an IV drip unit  ...



Miguel glances at a chart on the wall, in which a day is
broken into hours, with medical instructions for each hour


                         
                    Drew! Are you ready? If we
                    start at eight, we'll be done by
                    twelve.

Miguel taps the IV bag, getting the drip started.

A cat jumps onto the counter. Miguel holds it.




pad, holding out his left arm . A catheter is
imbedded into Andrew's arm, and Miguel is trying to get the
IV drip started through the catheter. The MUSIC is lower...


                    It's not going through.


                         
                    We'll have to flush it again.

Andrew reaches for a law book.


                    Hold still. Shit.
                         
                    The goddamn vein's clotted. We
                    have to go the goddamn hospital,
                    so they can change the goddamn
                    catheter.


                    I have too much work to do.
                    Skip the treatment.


                    We're not skipping this
                    treatment.


                    I said, skip it, Michael. It's
                    my treatment.


                    Fuck you.


                    Fuck you. This shit's probably
                    not doing me any good anyway.


                    That shit's saving your life,
                    you asshole!

Miguel shoves away from the table.


                    What's wrong with you?


                    Close the law book.


                    I'm not going to close the--




Andrew slams it SHUT.



                         
                    Jesus!


                    The least you can do is look at
                    me, while I'm sticking this shit
                    into your arm. Forget the
                    fucking case, one hour a day,
                    and give me a little of your
                    time.


                         
                    You don't think there's much
                    time left, do you?


                    That's not what I said.


                    You're scared. You think we're
                    near the end.


                    No.


                    Maybe I should start making plans, is
                    that what you think? Start
                    planning my memorial service?
                    "Begin to prepare for the
                    inevitable."


                         
                    Maybe you should think about it.


                    What's that mean?!


                         
                    Maybe you should think about it.




                    I'm not going to die.


                    That's right. We're on the
                    Positive Plan. You
                    don't have a Fatal Disease, you
                    have Manageable Illness.


                    You want me to give up? Let this
                    thing turn us into ?


                    Then, what  we, Drew?! The
                    ? "Ladies and gentlemen,
                    the first prize of AIDS goes to
                    Andrew Beckett and his lover
                    Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not
                    your lover. I'm your Care Partner.



                    I'm not ready to die.


                    Do you think I'm ready for it?!
                    I hate this shit. I'm not a
                    fucking martyr! I hate every
                    goddamn part of it!

Miguel slides down the wall, sitting in a heap.

Andrew goes to him. They hug. Miguel holds him tight.


                    Please don't leave me. I love
                    you so much. Don't die, don't
                    leave me, please...

Miguel rocks in Andrew's arms. Andrew kisses the top of his
head, holding tight.


                    I am so scared. I am so fucking,
                    incredibly, fucking scared...

A MOMENT. Andrew stroking Miguel's hair, as he calms down.


                    You know, there's only one thing to
                    do.
                         
                    We have to have a party.



JOE AND LISA STAND OUTSIDE ANDREW'S APARTMENT -- .
DANCE MUSIC is playing inside  ...

Lisa is dressed as a giant sandwich. Joe's costume looks quickly
thrown together: he's wearing a suit, but has pages from a legal
document stapled all over the suit.


                    Did I ever tell you, I hate
                    costume parties?


                    My lettuce is wilting.

The DOOR IS OPENED -- by the LEAD SINGER OF WHITE SNAKE: big
hair, leather, guitar.





                    We're friends of Beckett's.


                    It's me, you dork.


                    I'm Lisa Miller.


                    Glad to finally meet you. Come on in.



JOE AND LISA FOLLOW ANDREW INTO THE APARTMENT (HE LIMPS, relying
on his cane, but he's got A LOT OF ENERGY). The room is filled
with two Madonnas, an M.C. Hammer, three nuns, a can of soup



                         
                    I have to introduce you to the
                    can of soup. You can enter the
                    costume contest together as a
                    lunch special.

Miguel approaches, dressed as a MEMBER OF MEGA-DEATH or ANTHRAX.
He strikes a pose, contorts his face and hits an air guitar riff.
Andrew crosses guitars with Miguel. Then:


                    This is Lisa Miller. Miguel Alvarez.

Miguel's sister MARIA is passing by with a GROUP OF FRIENDS.
Everyone ad libs greetings.


                    My sister, Maria.
                         
                    Pastrami on rye?


                    Corned beef.


                    Want to dance?


                    Sure!

Miguel leads Lisa away. Joe is reluctant to give her up.


                    Beckett. You seem... better.
                    Energized, more alive...


                    I had a blood transfusion today.
                    I feel great.

Andrew studies Joe, trying to figure out the costume.


                    I'm a law suit.


                    Not bad.


                    Get it?


                    Let's find you a drink.

Andrew leads Joe through the crowd, greeting Rachel, skin
painted blue ,
Anthea, TYRONE from Dr. Gillman's office , and
TYRONE'S LOVER  ... Some of Dr. Gillman's PATIENTS
are here too, including the YOUNG ASIAN MAN who is now in a
wheelchair. And, one or two of ANDREW'S SIBLINGS may be
present as well. And Alan, Bruno and Chandra, and some arty
friends and neighbors.


                    What do you want?


                    Beer.
                         
                    We need to go over your Q and A.


                    Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn
                    party, is that allright with you?


                    Sure. It's fine.


                    No, we have to do it. But
                    later, allright?


                    Thank you.

A MAN dressed as LA TOYA JACKSON  squeezes
past Joe, reaching for a beer.


                    'Scuse me, darling.

Andrew is SMILING at Joe.


                    You think I'm uncomfortable...


                    Correct.


                    You're right.

Joe spills beer down his shirt.


                    Thank you.

battle of the guitars. At one point, Andrew has to sit
down, but he doesn't stop "playing," while Miguel jumps all
around him.

                    Nice costume.

Lisa climbs into the cab which she is sharing with the NUN
and MARIE ANTOINETTE and LA TOYA.

Joe opens his briefcase, removing a legal pad with notes.


                    Congratulations, Miller.

Andrew clears away party debris from the table, making space
for his legal work. He is attached to an IV line, which is
connected to a drip bag on a rolling stand, that can move
with him. He is no longer in costume.


                    You survived your first gay
                    party intact.


                    Let me tell you something, okay?
                    When you're brought up, like the
                    rest of us, in a place like where
                    I was brought up, there's not a
                    whole lot of discussion about...
                    homosexuals.
                    As a kid, you're taught right away
                    that queers are weird, queers are
                    funny, they're a danger to kids,
                    they're afraid to fight, and they
                    all want to cop your joint. And
                    that pretty much sums up the
                    general thinking out there, if you
                    want to know the truth.


                    Thank you for sharing that with me,
                    Joe.


                    Let's review these notes for your
                    testimony. We have a big day on
                    Monday.

Joe begins ticking off a list of courtroom reminders:


                    When you refer to Wheeler, call him
                    Charles, to show how you'd been
                    admitted to the inner circle, you
                    were considered one of them.


                         
                    Uh huh...


                    Beckett?


                    Charles. Okay. Miller?


                    What?


                    Do you... pray?

Joe hesitates. They're having a personal conversation?


                    Yeah. Sure.

Joe goes back to the notes:


                    Then we establish how Wheeler's
                    boys recruited you after law
                    school...


                    What have you prayed for?


                    For a healthy baby. For Lisa to
                    make it through the delivery.
                    For the Phillies to get into the
                    playoffs.


                         
                    There's a possibility I won't be
                    around for the end of this
                    trial.


                    I've considered that.


                    What happens?


                    We proceed, representing your
                    estate.


                    I've made provisions in my will
                    for some charities. Miguel will
                    need a lawyer. I know it's not
                    your area...


                    I know a good probate lawyer.


                    Thanks.
                         
                    Do you like opera?

Andrew moves to the stereo, pulling the IV line with him.


                    Opera?


                    Want to hear my favorite aria?


                    Opera?


startling Joe with its VOLUME.


                         
                    Andrea Chenier, by Giordano.
                    This is Madeleine. She's
                    telling how, during the French
                    revolution, a mob set
                    fire to her house. Her mother
                    died, saving her.

                    "I look...
                    The place that cradled me was
                    burning!"

                    Do you hear the heartache in her
                    voice? Then, here come the
                    strings. Everything changes.
                    The music fills with hope.
                    Madeleine says...

Andrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the IV
at his side. He seems truly free and relaxed.


                    "It was during that sorrow that
                    love came to me!

                    A voice filled with harmony
                    That said...
                    Live still, I am Life!"

                    "I am the god that descends
                    From the heavens to the earth
                    To make of the earth
                    A heaven!"

ANGLE ON JOE: Shifting, uncomfortable.


                    "I am Oblivion!
                    I am Glory!
                    I am Love, Love, Love!"

The MUSIC ENDS.

Joe sits there, fidgeting. He reaches for his briefcase
organizing his notes.


                    I think I'll... I told Lisa.

Andrew collects himself, as Joe rises from his chair.


                    Right.

Andrew follows Joe to the door.


                         
                    I'll look over the Q and A.


                    You're ready, don't worry.

An awkward moment, both men standing with their hands at
their sides -- will one of them initiate a handshake?

Joe gives a little "salute," then leaves.







                    Jesus.

Suddenly, Joe HEARS: OPERA MUSIC PLAYING AGAIN.

He pauses, listening.




passionate MUSIC  ...

The IV stand catches against the sofa, tugging the line.

Andrew pulls the line out of his arm. He moves, freer now.






Joe lifts his hand to KNOCK.

He changes his mind.


                    Fucking guy...

Joe moves down the corridor, rings for the elevator.




MUSIC pull him along  ...





The doors closing.









Joe crosses the yard to his dark house.





Joe looks down on the baby, adjusting the blanket.





Joe doffs his jacket, sinking quietly onto the edge of the
bed, careful not to disturb Lisa.

With his BACK TO CAMERA, Joe puts his head into his hands...

And begins to weep.








HIGH, WIDE ANGLE ON THE COURTROOM, IN   ...

Andrew moves very slowly with his cane across the courtroom,
toward the witness stand.

--JUDGE GARNETT crosses his arms, waiting.

--JOE glances at some notes.

--MIGUEL and SARAH BECKETT look on anxiously.

--WHEELER and the others observe in silence.




TITLE: ""

The BAILIFF places the Bible in front of Andrew (a purple
blotch is showing in front of Andrew's ear.)


                    Place your left hand on the
                    Bible and raise your right hand.

                    Wyant Wheeler had aggressively
                    recruited me. They were the
                    most prestigious firm in
                    Philadelphia, full of
                    opportunity. And I was
                    impressed by the partners.


                    Including Charles Wheeler?

(Andrew frequently wipes sweat from his forehead with a
handkerchief. His voice is hoarse, raspy.)


                    Particularly, Charles.




                    What impressed you about him?


                    He was... the kind of person I
                    thought I wanted to be.


                    What kind of person is that?


                    Possessed of an encyclopedic
                    knowledge of the law. A razor
                    sharp litigator, a genuine
                    leader, gifted at bringing out
                    the very best in others. An
                    awesome ability to illuminate
                    the most complex of legal
                    concepts to colleagues,
                    courtrooms, the person on the
                    street.
                         
                    The kind of person
                    who plays three sets of tennis but
                    doesn't sweat. But underneath the
                    elegant surface, was an
                    adventurous spirit.

Belinda Conine MAKES A NOTE ABOUT THAT.


                    Obviously, at this time, you
                    weren't sick.


                    It's possible I was infected with
                    the HIV virus at that time, but I
                    wasn't diagnosed until several years
                    later.


                    You didn't look then, the way you
                    look now?


COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 


                    No. I was thirty pounds heavier.
                    I was athletic.


                    A regular all-American guy?


                    I suppose you could say that.


                    Except... you were gay?


                    I still am.




                    In the years you worked at Wyant
                    Wheeler, did you ever tell
                    Charles Wheeler you were gay?


                    No. I didn't.


                    Can you explain  you didn't?


                    You don't bring your personal
                    life into a law firm. You're
                    not supposed to  a personal
                    life, really. Anyway, I did
                    plan to tell Charles,
                    eventually. But then, this
                    thing happened at the tennis
                    club...

                    What?


                    A bitch who knows everything.

LAUGHTER. Andrew keeps his eyes closed, leaning against the
wall of the sauna, next to Wheeler, relaxing.


                    How does a faggot fake an orgasm?

Andrew opens one eye.


                    He spits on your back.


                    Charles, that's revolting!

All the men LAUGH, and Wheeler LAUGHS THE HARDEST.


                    How did that make you feel?

IMAGE: BACK TO THE COURTROOM. ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND (And

                    Relieved. That I'd never told
                    him I was gay. Very relieved.

ANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER: shakes his head, a denial.


                    Are you a good lawyer?


                    I'm an excellent lawyer.


                    What makes you an excellent
                    lawyer?


                    I love the law. I know the law.
                    I excel at practicing it. It's
                    the only thing I've ever wanted to do.


                    What do you love about it?


                    Well... many things. But I
                    think the thing I love the most,
                    is that every once in a while,
                    not that often, but
                    occasionally... you get to be
                    part of justice being done.
                    It's really quite a thrill when
                    that happens.






                    You said earlier you aspired to
                    be the kind of person who had
                    "an adventurous spirit." Is
                    that correct?


                    Something like that.


                    Do you take risks?


                    In my work? Yes. Calculated
                    risks. You have to.


                    In general. Do you take risks
                    in other areas of your life?


                    Not unnecessary ones.


                    Have you ever been to the Apollo
                    Cinema on Sansom Street?

Robert laughs, closing the door of the booth.

Joe sits with a stone-sober expression: this isn't easy.


                    When? Approximately what year did
                    this event take place?


                    I guess it was 1984, 85.


                    Were you aware in 1984 or 1985
                    that there was a fatal disease
                    out there, called AIDS, and that
                    you could contract it through
                    sexual activity?


                    It's impossible to know exactly
                    when or how I was infected with HIV.

                    sex in porno theaters in 1984
                    and 1985?


                    That happened once. People
                    weren't talking about AIDS then,
                    the way we are now. Or safe

                    didn't know how you could get it,
                    or that it could kill you.

CLOSE SHOT ON ANDREW -- losing strength.


                         
                    Do you need a break?


                    No.


                    While you were employed at Wyant
                    Wheeler, you did everything you
                    could to make sure no one knew
                    you were an active homosexual,
                    correct?


                    That is  correct. I never lied
                    about it.


                    Did you keep a picture of your
                    lover on your desk?


                    No.


                    Do other lawyers at the firm keep
                    pictures of their spouses or
                    fiances on their desks?

PHOTO ON THE WALL OF BOB'S WIFE AND CHILDREN .


                    Some do. I didn't.


                    As a homosexual, one is often forced
                    to conceal one's sexuality, is
                    that right?


                    In some situations.


                    Isn't it true you have spent your
                    life pretending to be something
                    you're not, so much so that the
                    art of concealment and dishonesty
                    has become second nature to you?!


                    Objection!


                    I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett?
                    Were you living with Miguel
                    Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you
                    had your anonymous sexual encounter
                    in the porn theater?

ANGLE ON MIGUEL, sitting next to Sarah.


                    Yes.


                    You could have infected him, isn't
                    that right?


                    Miguel has not been infected. As
                    I said, we weren't aware of AIDS,
                    then, or how it is spread.


                    Really?


                    Yes.

Andrew wipes sweat from his forehead.


                    You've testified the lesions on
                    your face were visible to the
                    people you worked with, correct?


                    That's right.


                    And it's your contention, that
                    when the partners were made
                    aware of the lesions, they
                    jumped to the conclusion you had
                    AIDS and fired you.


                    Absolutely.


                    Do you have any lesions on your
                    face at this time?


                    One. Here, in front of my ear.

An ASSISTANT hands Conine a shaving mirror. She holds it
before Andrew.


                    Remembering you are under oath,
                    answering truthfully, can you
                    see the lesion on your face, in
                    this mirror, three feet away?
                    Answering truthfully.

Andrew looks in the mirror: the lesion is NOT very visible.


                    By the time I was fired, there
                    were four lesions on my face,
                    much bigger...


                    Answer the question, please.


                    No. I can't really see it.


                    Thank you.

Andrew rubs his eyes.


                         
                    This would be a good time to
                    break for the day...


                         
                    Your Honor? May I have ten
                    minutes in re-direct?


                         
                    Beckett?

Andrew finds the Judge looking at him.


                    Can you go on for ten minutes?


                    Yes sir.

Joe JUMPS UP from the plaintiff's table.


                    I only need five!
                         (to Belinda, reaching
                         for the mirror)
                    May I?

Joe approaches Andrew, with the mirror.


                    Do you have any lesions on 
                    part of your body, at this time,
                    that resemble the lesions that
                    were on your face at the time
                    you were fired?


                    Yes. On my torso.


                    If it please the court, I'd like
                    to ask Mr. Beckett to
                    remove his shirt, so that the
                    jury can have an  idea
                    of what we're talking about.


                    We object, Your Honor. It would
                    unfairly influence the jury.


                    Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was
                    forced by his illness to use a
                    wheelchair, would the defense
                    ask him to park it outside?
                    We're talking about AIDS, we're
                    talking about lesions. Let's
                     what we're talking about.




                         
                    I'll allow it. Would you mind
                    removing your shirt, Mr.
                    Beckett?




                    Allright.

The COURTROOM TURNS SILENT.

Andrew removes his suit jacket. He's weak, so the smallest
gesture requires effort.



Andrew undoes his tie.



Andrew unbuttons his collar buttons, working his way down.



Andrew stands, pulling his shirttails out of his trousers.



Andrew removes his shirt -- THERE ARE PURPLE BLOTCHES


The SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR GASPS.

Sarah Beckett is silently crying.

The LESBIAN JUROR closes her eyes.


                    Can you see the lesions on your
                    chest in this mirror?


                    Yes.


                    Thank you.






Charles Wheeler strides down the corridor, flanked by
Kenton, Killcoyne and Belinda, discussing strategy.

Bob Seidman steps to Wheeler's side, keeping pace.


                    I've discovered something
                    interesting, Charles.


                         
                    ... keep them from that area,
                    on grounds of relevancy.
                         
                    What, Bob?


                    No matter how hard I try, I
                    can't lose a file in my
                    computer.

NOW he's got EVERYONE'S attention.


                    The system automatically makes a
                    backup.

Belinda holds up both hands, interrupting with:


                    I don't think I should hear this.

She walks away, giving a glance over her shoulder as:


                    You can erase the backup...
                         
                    But  would you?


                         
                    What's the point, Bob?


                         
                    Very interesting, Bob. Let's make a
                    note of that. Andy didn't lose the
                    complaint in his computer. He
                    never put it in. He lied about
                    that, too.


                         
                    Charles...


                    If you feel differently, Bob, you
                    should say so, when you're called
                    to the stand. After all, this
                    isn't a conspiracy.

Wheeler and the gang moves on, leaving Seidman alone in the
high-ceilinged corridor.

Belinda hesitates, before re-grouping with Wheeler and the
rest, casting a curious glance toward Bob Seidman.






                    Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett
                    to your firm?

Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate.

Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity.


                    If you're the owner of a major
                    league ball club, you recruit the
                    hot rookie. And Andy was tremendously
                    promising as a young attorney.
                    That's why we went after him,
                    that's why we hired him, and
                    that's why we stuck with him,
                    year after year... waiting for
                    the promise to be fulfilled. But
                    it never was.


                    You kept giving him another chance?


                    Of course we did. When you've
                    groomed someone they way we groomed
                    Andy, nurturing him, lavishing all
                    kinds of special treatment on him...
                    you've made quite an investment.
                    We were waiting for his promise to
                    kick in, and deliver. But,
                    ultimately, we could no longer
                    ignore the gap between the promise
                    and the reality... This is one of
                    the saddest times in my life. To
                    sit in this court, testifying to
                    Andy's ultimate failure to make
                    the grade. To discover that he is
                    one of those people who wants to
                    benefit by the system, but doesn't
                    want to play by the system's
                    rules. To think you  someone,
                    only to find out... you don't know
                    them at all. It's heartbreaking.


                    Thank you. That's all for now,
                    Your Honor.


                    Mr. Miller?

Joe rises. Adjusts his jacket. Wheeler waits.


                         
                    Explain to me, if you can, Mr.
                    Wheeler, explain this to me like
                    I'm a ten year-old. This trial is
                    not about a disease, is that what
                    you're saying?  about your
                    understandable, if unfounded, fear
                    of catching AIDS through casual
                    contact with someone who has it?
                    You're saying, this trial is about
                    Andrew Beckett's character. Am I
                    getting this right?


                    Yes, character. To the extent that it
                    affects a person's ability to do
                    a great job.

Andrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat, breathing
difficult. He takes in the rest of the court, while
Wheeler's words THROB THROUGH THE AIR...


                    Andy worked when he wanted to work,
                    telling us what he thought we
                    needed to know about his
                    lifestyle...

ANDREW'S POV -- ON RACHEL, sitting among the spectators. Rachel
begins speaking, her WORDS OVERLAPPING Wheeler's (we should get
the feeling she's giving her testimony).


                    I didn't mind covering for Andy,
                    but I did wonder... when was he
                    planning to deal with his problem?

Andrew blinks... what's going on?

Looking back to the court: Joe presses in on Wheeler.

Everything seems normal.


                    Sometimes it seems like society
                    is  by these kinds of people.


                    What kind of people?


                    People who want to bend the rules...

ANDREW'S POV -- KENNETH KILLCOYNE at the defense table:


                    If you want to be a leader in this
                    society, you have to make
                    certain sacrifices.

Wheeler keeps speaking:


                    ... to suit their personal desires,
                    and the rest of us have to live
                    with it.




                    You have to make a decision: is
                    this guy partner material?


                    Who makes the rules, Mr. Wheeler?
                    




                    Yes, I did see the lesions. I
                    suspected he was sick...

CLOSE ON ANDREW: closing his eyes.




                    The everyday, common person with
                    decent values...


                    It seems like he wasn't willing to
                    face the  of his situation...

Andrew slowly rises, the VOICES GETTING LOUDER:


                    I didn't tell the others, I
                    was afraid to...


                    ... But now, we're standing up for
                    ourselves...


                    ... But we shouldn't have fired
                    him...


                    ... It's time to get this society
                    back on track!

Andrew OPENS HIS EYES... WE SWITCH TO HIS POV:

The Judge, the Jury -- everyone silent, looking concerned.

ANDREW'S POV of the courtroom floor.

Andrew falls into his own POV SHOT. In slow motion.

He lies on the floor, looking up.

ANDREW'S POV -- Joe steps over him.


                    Could you call an ambulance,
                    please?




working frenetically, trying to intubate Andrew, who IS
HAVING SERIOUS TROUBLE BREATHING, his body HEAVING. The
tube they're trying to put in place seems to be making
matters worse.

Miguel stands to the side, furious:


                    It's making it worse. Take it
                    out. Take it out!

Dr. Gillman RUSHES into the room, in street clothes,
obviously having answered an emergency call. She tries
assessing the situation, just as the tube is removed and
Andrew GASPS for breath. A NURSE places an oxygen mask over
Andrew's face and he drinks in the air. His eyes are wide
open with fear, sweat covering his face.

                    If he was "mediocre," why did
                    they gave him this major

                    they fired him?

                    Makes sense.


                    I'd still love to know what
                    happened to that missing file.


                    Wouldn't we all?


                    Ask the computer.


                    They say he wasn't competent. But,
                    you heard him on the stand.


                    He sounded pretty smart to me.


                    Why would they fire him? Why
                    not a medical leave, or...


                    They freaked out over the AIDS.


                    They hate homosexuals.


                    It's not against the law to
                    disapprove of homosexuals.


                    It  against the law to fire someone
                    for having AIDS. That's why we're
                    here.


                    You're the foreman. You haven't said
                    anything. What do you think?

ANGLE ON -- THE MARINE, sitting at the head of the table.




                    They're saying he wasn't a good
                    lawyer. He was mediocre. And the
                    fact that they gave him the most
                    important lawsuit they'd ever had,
                    for one of their most important
                    clients... they say that doesn't
                    prove anything, because that was
                    just a test. What did they call
                    it? A carrot. To see if he'd rise
                    to the occasion... Okay... Say
                    I've got to send a pilot into
                    enemy territory, and he's gonna
                    be flying a plane that cost 350
                    million dollars...
                    Who am I going to put into that
                    plane? A rookie who can't cut the
                    grade, because I want to see if
                    he'll rise to the challenge? Or am
                    I going to give that assignment to
                    my best pilot, my most experienced,
                    my sharpest, my top gun... The very
                    best I've got?




                    Could somebody please explain that
                    to me... like I'm a six year old?




                    Members of the jury, have you
                    reached a verdict?





Joe is utterly cool. Sitting beside .

Among the spectators, Andrew's siblings, Jill, Matt, Randy, and
his parents, Bud and Sarah... Rachel, Anthea and Miguel's
sister Maria.

The Marine rises to his feet.


                    We have, Your Honor...

Charles Wheeler looks the Marine in the eye.


                    We find for the plaintiff,
                    Andrew Beckett.

Joe smiles, just barely, remaining calm.

Charles Wheeler whispers to Belinda Conine.


                    Have you awarded any damages?


                    Yes, we have, Your Honor.
                         
                    For back pay and loss of benefits
                    ... one hundred fortythree
                    thousand dollars.

Joe shakes his head, disappointed, writing down the amount.

Wheeler and his crew SMILE -- THIS IS  VICTORY.


                    For damages related to mental
                    anguish and humiliation... we give
                    no award.

Joe is  disappointed.


                    And punitive damages we award...
                    Four million, eight hundred and
                    eighty two thousand dollars.

Joe throws his pen over his shoulder.



Andrew's supporters, Joe's colleagues from his office rush
forward, pounding him on the back. Andrew's family members
hug each other...







a hospital , carrying two shopping bags from the
Famous 4th Street deli...

Joe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room.

Dr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low
voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them,
entering Andrew's room, he hears:


                    ... if he comes out of the
                    hospital this time, you mustn't
                    expect him to be like he was
                    before...

Joe steps into...



A hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed:
"Victory."

OPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a
hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face.

JILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand,
smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free
hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an
amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various
parts of his body.)

Andrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV.
JIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while
Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering
the judgment. Matt's audience is loving it.

As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags
from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others.

People KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and
happiness evident in the room.

ON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling
eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile.

ON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look.

Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he
wants Joe to sit there.

Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed.

With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His
voice is raspy, weak:


                    What do you call a thousand lawyers
                    chained together at the bottom of the
                    ocean?


                    What?


                    A good start.

Joe smiles.


                    Excellent work, Joe. I thank
                    you.


                    It was good working with you, Andrew.
                    You're welcome.
                         
                    Hey. Shouldn't you put
                    that thing back on?

Andrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are
weak. Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears.


                    I better get home. Lisa and I
                    are having some friends over.


                         
                    Sure thing.

Joe stands.


                    I'll see you, Beckett.

Andrew nods, weakly. But he's still smiling and his eyes
are dancing.


                         
                    Thanks for coming by.


                    You bet. We'll see you later.

Joe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there.


                         
                    He's looking good. I wouldn't
                    be surprised if he gets out of
                    here soon.


                    We just want to get him home.
                    Thanks for stopping by, Joe.

Miguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him. Joe slaps
Miguel's back.


                    Night.

Joe leaves.

Miguel begins circulating among the "guests," saying:


                    He's tired. He ought to sleep.




saying to a GROUP OF DOCTORS and NURSES:


                    What do you call a thousand
                    lawyers chained together at
                    the bottom of the ocean?

The elevator doors close.





Matt gives Andrew's hand a squeeze, before leaving.


                    Night, Andy. See you tomorrow,
                    buddy.

Rev. Jim pats Andrew's shoulder.


                    God bless you, Andy.

Bud Beckett kisses Andrew on the cheek.


                    Goodnight, son.
                    Get some rest, okay?

Sarah Beckett is strong, kissing Andrew on the forehead.


                    Goodnight angel, my sweet boy...

Randy Beckett loses control of his emotions as he bends to hug
his brother. He begins to sob.


                    Andy.

Andrew puts his weak arms, with the IV lines connected,
around his brother Randy, to comfort him.


                         
                    I'm okay, bro. I'll see you tomorrow.

Jill hugs Andrew, giving Miguel a kiss as she leaves the room.
Maria waves goodnight from the doorway, closing the door.

Miguel sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off his shoes.

Miguel stretches onto the bed next to Andrew, picks up the
remote control, and TURNS ON THE TV.

Andrew pulls aside the oxygen mask, to say:


                    I'm ready...


                    Ready for what, baby?


                    Whatever.


                    I hope you're ready for "Studs,"
                    because that's what's on.

Andrew replaces the oxygen mask.

They lie next to each other, watching television.





From inside the house: the phone rings.





Lisa is sitting up in bed, having answered the phone.

Joe is just waking up.


                         
                    It's Miguel.

Joe sits bolt upright.


                    Miguel?





A TAXI ARRIVES and an elegant, well-dressed older COUPLE
step out.




on the other side: very dignified, handsome people who have
just arrived from Spain. They enter the apartment, where...

A wake is in progress. Lots of food. People sharing stories
about Andrew. Some people laughing. one or two softly crying
as they hug each other.

Someone has set up a "memento" table, with pictures of Andrew
at various stages of his life, and things that meant something
to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his
favorite cat, etc.

THEME MUSIC PLAYS, but we hear BITS OF DIALOGUE under the
music ("You're Miguel's parents?" "Do you remember when
Andy..." "I went to college with Andy..." etc.)

Bud Beckett sits alone, very quiet.

Miguel leads his parents over to Bud. Bud looks up, rises,
extending his hand to MIGUEL'S DAD. Miguel's father shakes his
head in sadness, reaches for Bud and pulls him into his arms for
an embrace.




CAMERA ZEROS IN ON THE TV SET, across the room, where BLACK AND
WHITE IMAGES ARE FLICKERING, ignored by everyone...

AS CAMERA GETS CLOSER TO THE TV, it becomes apparent that the
images are BLACK AND WHITE HOME MOVIES, converted to video...

THE HOME MOVIES FEATURE a bright-eyed LITTLE BOY...

Andrew...

Riding a bike with training wheels...

Swinging wildly at a wiffle ball...


FADES... People are still talking, still laughing, still
crying, but we CAN'T HEAR THEM ANY LONGER. Instead...

We hear only the SOUNDTRACK from the HOME MOVIES...

Andrew SHOUTING GLEEFULLY as he chases a new puppy...

Andrew SQUEALING as he jumps into a tiny swimming pool...

Andrew on a swing, going higher and higher...

And laughing.







May we never find space so vast, 
planets so cold, heart 
and mind so empty 
that we cannot fill them 
with love and warmth...
