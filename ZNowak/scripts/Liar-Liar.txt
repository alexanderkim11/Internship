          Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS.
          BERRY. The word "Work" is on the blackboard.


                    "Work." Today we're going to
                    share what our parents do for
                    work.
          QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside
          their desks, addressing the class:


                    My dad is a truck driver.


                    My mommy is a doctor.


                    My dad is a librarian and my
                    mom is a vegetarian.


                          
                    My father is a struck-sher-al-
                    engine-ear.


                    My mother is an actress. She
                    works at Denny's.


                    My daddy works at a place
                    where they make stuff, and my
                    mommy is a mommy.

                    My father is a postal worker.
          The QUICK CUTS end with MAX:


                    My mom's a teacher.
          As Max starts to sit:


                    And your dad?




                    My dad? He's . . . a liar.




                             

                        A liar? I don't think you
                        mean "a liar."


                        Well... he wears a suit and
                        goes to court and talks to the
                        judge and--




                        Oh! I see-- you mean he's a
                        lawyer.

              Max shrugs.





              FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His
              manner is utterly genuine and convincing.


                        A dark street. . . a stormy
                        night... two desperate men
                        struggle... one man is taken
                        to the hospital, the other to
                        ja il. The prosecutor wants
                        you to believe this is an
                        open-and-shut case of a poor
                        man, brutally victimized.
              He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's.


                        Well, for once I agree with
                        t he prosecutor. This is an
                        open-and shut case -- but the
                        true victim is my client.
              Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit.


                        Put yourself in his shoes for
                        a moment--walking home from
                        church, alone, in a
                        frightening part of the
                        suburbs.
              As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM






                    You're nervous, timid, looking
                    over your shoulder -- when
                    suddenly, you encounter him--
                          (pointing at the
                           old man)
                    pouncing from the shadows.
                    You quiver in fear. The
                    streetlight flashes on
                    something shiny in his hand--
                    a knife?

          Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a
          weapon. The jurors RECOIL.


                    And in that terrifying instant
                    you do what any respectable
                    citizen would -- you defend
                    y ou rse lf. Only after you
                    shatter his arm and collarbone
                    do you realize it's all a
                    mistake... the man was merely
                    walking away from an ATM
                    machine, the apparent flash of
                    metal caused by his bank card.
          He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.




                    As you stand over his
                    crumpled, though potentially
                    still-dangerous form, your
                    he art goes out to him. You
                    want to help. First, you
                    gather up the many bills he
                    dropped, to stop them from
                    bl owi ng away. Second, in an
                    effort to get the name and
                    number of someone to notify,
                    you take his wallet. Finally,
                    you leap into the man's Lexus
                    to head for assistance, when
                    suddenly a police car speeds
                    up. You breathe a sigh of
                    relief: "Someone to look -after
                    the injured man! Oh joy!"
                    But do the police applaud your
                    initiative? Do they hail your
                    heroism? No-- they arrest you
                    and throw you in the slammer!
          He walks along the jury box:




                  · And why? Why does the State
                   turn its massive power against

                   wants you to think - - i t ' s
                   always the big guy's fault.
                   Is that what we've come to as
                   a society -- persecuting
                   people because they're large?
          Fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.

                   absolutely no bearing on this
                   case.
          In the front row we see two sad-faced YOUNG CHILDREN.

          Fletcher returns to his seat. Jurors, dab their eyes.



          Fletcher bounds down the stairs, passing a fellow LAWYER,


                    How's it going, Fletcher?


                          
                    Another gratifying day serving
                    Justice.
          Fletcher's huge client catches up to him.


                    Hey great job, Mr. Reid. I
                    wish there was some way I
                    could show my appreciation.


                    Stay out of my neighborhood
                    after dark.
          A PUBLICIST carrying, a clipboard approaches Fletcher.


                    Mr. Reid, do you have a ·
                    moment-?


                    No, I'm late picking up my

                    How's my hair?
          And he's off to woo a GANG OF REPORTERS.







          A sad Max and his mother, AUDREY, wait silently on the

                        like Jerry's taking that job
                        offer in Boston.

          Fletcher starts off with Max, when Philip calls after him.


                    You know, Ethel and I had a
                    blast at our last little get-

                    enough of charades. We'll
                    have to do it again sometime.
          Fletcher heads into an open elevator... only to find the
          door's closing impededby Philip's foot.


                    When?


                    Soon.
          The door again begins to close... when Philip stops it.


                   How 'bout tonight?




                    Not that soon. I'm taking Max

                    We love wrestling.     We could--


                    I don't think so. See, Max is
                    really shy around strangers.
          Max looks up at Fletcher.    He isn't.

          The receptionist, JANE, greets them. Jane has an ODD,

                    present the strongest case
                    possible.

                   ethically. But, Miranda -- I
                   won't lie.
          Miranda looks out her window, calculating.

                   someone who'will.







          Fletcher strides through the hallway with Max, calling out
          GREETINGS to his colleagues.

                   occasion, some small symbol to
                   mark this day, like....
          Fletcher produces --


                    . . . A present! .


          Max eyes it with wonder.


                   What is it?


                         
                   It's... it's.
                         
                   a surprise.
          Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the
          box open, revealing, a BASEBALL, GLOVE, DODGER'S CAP, and




                   Baseball stuff!

                       Will you play catch with me?






                       Absorootentootenlutely.
          Max beams.


                       Tonight. After your party,
                       you have my word on it.
          Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work.



          Jerry and Audrey are driving. Audrey's holding a couple of
          airline tickets.


                            
                       Jerry, these are for tomorrow.


                       The company wants me to get
                       started right away.


                   I can't just pick up and move
                   to Boston with two days
                   notice.


                   Ju st come check it out. You
                   a nd Max, see the town. Let's
                 . pick out a place together.
                   Then, if you want to turn me
                   down and scar me for life,
                   fine.


                   It's just not that simple...
                   What about my job? I've been
                   at UCLA three years.


                   It's New England. They're
                   lousy with colleges. You
                   can't swing a bat back there
                   without hitting a college.


                    You'd get a job there in a
                    second.


                    There are other factors
                    involved.


                    T here they are now.       ·.
          They pull up in front of Fletcher's building where Fletcher
          and Max are waiting. Fletcher's still reviewing a file.
          As Audrey gets out of Jerry's car, Max runs over.


                    Did you have fun? How were
                    the wrestling matches?


                    Big fun. Manly fun. Am I
                    right, Maxie?




                    It was fun..




                         
                    So how were the wrestling
                    matches ? Did you have fun?


                    Max , my man! My happy
                    birthday man!
          Max and Jerry exchange "fives" and'a hug.   Jerry gives Max
          a light punch on the arm.


                    One-two-three-four-five... and
                    one for good luck.


                    Did you see that? He struck
                    the child!


                    Look what dad got me!
                         


                   Whoa! Great! I have my glove
                   in the car. We'll stop in the
                   park on the way home and play
                   c atch. Then tonight we'll oil


                    it, wrap a rubber band around
                    it. . . It'll be great.
                          
                    Great birthday present, dad!
          Fletcher hates him.    Jerry and Max go to Jerry's car.


                         
                    When is it his birthday?


                    Some thing's come up. We need
                    to talk.


                    Mom, let's go. I want to
                    play.


                          
                    We'll talk tonight.




                    Tonight?


                    Max's birthday?


                    Oh , yeah, right. Seven. I
                    knew that. I did. I blocked
                    it out weeks ago. The

                    birthday.


                    It's the eighteenth.


                    The seventeenth of May is the
                    day I .remind myself that the
                    eighteenth is Max's birthday.

                    This is good. This is really
                    smart.

                   Only i t ' s . . . Like not true.
                   Every word of it is a lie.
          Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances.


                   I mean... isn't that a
                   problem?


                   Mrs. Cole, the only problem
                   here is that after you've
                   provided years of faithful
                   service and loving support, of
                   raising his children -- They
                   are his?


                   H m ? Oh yeah. One for sure.


                   After all that, your husband
                   wants to deny you a fair share
                   of the marital assets based on
                   one single act of

                   Hm?




                   Seven single acts of
                   indiscretion.

                   only one of which he has any
                   evidence of, and all of which
                   he himself is responsible, for.


                   He is?




          Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all
          night last night studying your
          c ase. Not just your case...
          b ut you. And, by now, I feel
          I know you. You are the
          victim here. The wife of a
          cold, distant businessman.
          Starved for affection, driven
          into the arms of another man--

          insisting on is what is
          r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe
          an idgy-smidgy bit more. I
          think you're bending over
          backwards.


          Well, I did agree to give him
          j oint custody of the kids...

          Yeah. . .


          There's such a thing as being
          t oo nice. That's why you need
          aggr essive representation. To
          show the court that there is
          more than one side to this
          st ory. All I'm asking is the
          opportunity to see that
          justice is done on your
          behalf.
                
          Will you give me that
          opportunity?

                    kicked around.

                    Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so

                    can trust.

          farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves.
          Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door.
          She moves in on him.


                    You're good. You're really
                    good.

                   is worth a truckload of money
                   to this firm, not to mention
                   the press it's going to

                    does Fletcher take for Max,

                    you didn't remind him.

                      What happened?

          phone, before Miranda THROWS HIM BACK ONTO THE COUCH.



          WE PAN DOWN from banners reading HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAX!. . . to
          a room full of guests... to a desultory five-year-old.
          Audrey finishes lighting the candles on the homemade cake.


                    All right, birthday boy, make
                    a wish.
          Max doesn't respond.


                    C'mon, honey. It can be
                    anything-- whatever you want
                    most in the world.
          When he .doesn't respond, she leans down to him..


                    Max, your dad is sorry. He
                    had to work.


                    He said he was coming. He
                    promised.


                    Yes, well, he... promises
                    he'll see you tomorrow.
          Max doesn't believe it.     &lt;
          He turns his full attention to the candles on the cake.   In
          VOICE OVER we hear what she does not.


                    I wish, for just one day, Dad
                    couldn't tell a lie.
          He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A
          strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up,
          up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15.


          A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are--







          PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is
          adorned with Fletcher's shoes...
          To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang...
          To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing...
          To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to
          Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks--


                    S o . . . was it good for you?
          Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing
          way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH.


                    I've had better.
          Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing
          compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face.





          The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully
          kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF
          CLOTHES follow.
          The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants.
          A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her
          broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . .





          An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With
          regret and wonder he remembers:


                    "I've had better?"





          Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in
          the mirror, mouth foaming.


                    "I've had better?!"



          Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator.




                         
                    "I've had better?"
          I t arrives. He steps in.



          The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a
          beautiful young WOMAN.


                    New in the building?


                    I just moved in Monday.


                    Ah. Well, you must allow me
                    to give you the grand tour.






                    O h? Do you do that for all
                    the new tenants?


                    No. Just the ones I want to
                    bang like a drum.
          Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and...



          We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door
          opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps
          out, rubbing his freshly slapped face.



          A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he
          is accosted by a BEGGAR.


                    Any change, Mister?


                    Absolutely.
          But he continues walking.


                    Could you spare some?




                    Unquestionably.
          Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered
          truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled.


                    Will you?


                    No.


                    How come?


                   Because I resent your
                   p re sen ce. You fill me with an
                   unpleasant mixture of disgust
                   and guilt. Further, I don't
                   believe you'll use the money
                   for food, but I believe you'll
                   use it for, at worst, drugs,
                   or, at best, whiskey, or
                 . cigarettes. Also, I'm cheap.
          As Fletcher heads up the stairs...


                   Jerkoff.





          A winded Fletcher joins Virginia at the respondent's table,


                   You look like you're having a
                   rough morning.


                    I've had better.
          He WINCES as he recognizes the words. Then, an extremely
          wealthy, respectable industrialist, RICHARD COLE enters
          with his attorney, DANA APPLETON, young, brisk, confident.


                   Good morning, Fletcher.


                   Dana.         "




                    All right, Virginia, how much
                    will it take to put an end to
                    this?


                    Fifty per cent of your estate.
          Richard is SHOCKED.


                    Fifty per cent? With a pre-
                    nup and proof of adultery?
                    What's your case?


                    Our case is simply this. . .
          Fletcher opens his mouth to enlighten her -- but he CAN'T
          GET THE WORDS OUT. He tries to FORCE OUT SOUNDS, but
          succeeds only in looking like a fish gasping on dry land.


                    Interesting, though based on
                    your track record, I expected
                    a little more.
          Nearing panic, Fletcher whirls to his BRIEFCASE and grabs
          the brief.


                   Wa it! Wait!    I've got it in
                   writing!
          But when Dana tries to take the document, the astonished
          Fletcher finds himself PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO RELEASE IT.


                    Let go!


                    I'm trying!


          He INVOLUNTARILY snatches the document away and IT PULLS
          HIM to a nearby TRASH CAN where he throws it out.
          At this moment the BAILIFF calls.


                   All rise for the Honorable
                   Judge William Stevens.




                    Very funny, Fletcher. You
                    want to play hardball, I'm
                    game.
          JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench.




                    Calling case BA 09395, Richard
                    Cole versus Virginia Cole.
                    How're we doing this morning,
                    counsel?


                    Fine, thank you.


                   And you, Mr. Reid?


                    Well, I'm a little upset about
                    a bad sexual episode I had
                    last night--
          Fletcher screeches to a standstill, suddenly aware of what
          he just said. After an awkward silence--




                   Well, you're still young.
                   It'll happen more and more.
                   In the meantime, what do you
                   say we get. down to business?
                   First, Mr. Reid, I see that
                   your client was previously
                   represented by Mr. Rand of
                   your office.


                   Yes, Your Honor.


                    I take it you're seeking to
                    substitute in as counsel?


                   Yes, Your Honor.


                   Fine , fine. And for the
                   record, the reason is?




                    Mr. Rand had severe ethical
                    objections to my client's
                    case.
          Fletcher is incredulous. Somehow his greatest asset in the
          world, his mouth, has become his worst enemy.


                    I take it you don't share the
                    same ethical objections, Mr.
                    Reid?


                    I have lower standards, Your
                    Honor.


                    I see. Well, if Mrs. Cole
                    wants the substitution of
                    counsel, I'll allow it. Is
                    that what you want, Mrs. Cole?
          Virginia looks to the judge, then to Fletcher, whose
          unorthodox syle seemed so brilliant earlier.




                    Yes?


                    Fine.


                        (aside, to


                   What are you doing?






                   I don't know.
                         (to judge, with




                   Your Honor, I ' d like a
                   continuance!


                   This case has already been
                   delayed several times, Mr.
                   Reid.




                    I realize that, Your Honor,
                    but I ' d really, really, really
                    like a continuance.


                    I'll have to hear good cause,
                    counselor. What's the
                    problem?




          The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then
          faster -- until we wind up squarely on --




                    I can't lie!




                   Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm
                   still waiting for the good
                   caus e. Now, do you have it or
                 . not?




                    Not.


                    Motion for a continuance
                    denied. Is there any chance
                    of a settlement in this case?


                    I don't think so, Your Honor.
                    Mr. Reid made it abundantly
                    clear that the last thing in
                    the world he wanted was to --






          Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise.


                    There appears to have been a
                    change in strategy. Let's go
                    to my chambers and negotiate.
          He BANGS the gavel.





          Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge


                   Your Honor, under the terms of
                   the prenuptual agreement, if
                   Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
                   she is entitled to nothing.
                   We have in our possession an
                   audiotape made by a licensed
                   private investigator of an
                   explicit act of sexual
                   congress with a man who is not
                   her husband.


                   Sounds pretty damning, Mr.
                   Reid.


                   It certainly does.


                   However, my client has no
                   desire to see his ex-wife
                   destitute. Against my advice,
                   he's willing to offer her a
                   cash settlement of.two point
                   four million dollars.


                   Two four seems like a pretty
                   fair offer, Mr. Reid.


                   Fantastically fair.
                   Phenominally fair. In fact,
                   I'd say beyond fair, bordering
                   on stupid.
          Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness
          refreshing.


                   What are you suggesting, Mr.
                   Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's
                   willingness to proffer such an
                   offer betrays a lack of faith
                   in her position?


                        
                   No, not at all. She's got my
                   client dead to rights. When


                    attorneys go to sleep at
                    night, they dream of having a
                    case as strong as hers.


                    Can the sarcasm, Reid. All
                    right, I admit it -- I've seen
                    you make even the lamest case
                    fly. But this time I have
                    you. Even Clarence Darrow
                    couldn't explain this away.
          She brandishes the audiotape.


                    Wel l, Mr. Reid? without a
                    dynamite explanation, I'd say
                    you're dead in the water.
                    How's you client's story?


                    The best that money can buy,
                    Y o u r Honor.       ·


                    Strong corroborating evidence?


                    We have evidence that you are
                    not going to-believe.
          Despite herself, Dana is beginning to look worried.


                    You're pretty confident how
                    this trial is going to come
                    out, eh, Mr. Reid?


                          .
                    "Confident" is too weak a
                    word, Your Honor. I am
                    certain what will happen if I
                    take this puppy to trial. The
                    verdict will be a stunning,
                    humiliating defeat that will
                    cut a spectacularly promising
                    legal career off at the knees.
          Fletcher is referring to himself, of course, but Dana
          thinks he's speaking about her. She buckles.




                      All right! Double the offer!
                      Four point eight! And not a
                      penny more.
                            (venomous, to


                      Bastard!

                    Well , Mr. Reid. Do we have a
                    settlement?
          Fletcher looks pleadingly at his client, but she is firm.
          He shakes his head unhappily. The judge is irritated.

          toward him wearing a hairstyle that resembles a nest. He
          tries to avoid her, but...


                   What do you think?

          finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote

          Jerry asked me to marry him.
          He wants Max and I to fly with
          him this weekend to pick out a
          house. And I'm going to go.
          God knows I don't have any
          reason to stay here.

          Wait, you can't move! If you
          take Max away... I'll
          practically never see him.


          Well then you'll have pretty
          much the same relationship you
          have with him now.


          Audrey, please.... Is this
          because of what I just said on
          the phone?


          That was the straw and this is
          the camel's back saying
          goodbye.

                   Fletcher. I must confess--
                   after last night's incident, I
                   was. . . hurt. So hurt. I was
                   tempted to do whatever little
                   things lie in my power to
                   scuttle your chances of making
                   partner.
          Fletcher is FRIGHTENED.


                   But then I thought, "No,
                   that 's not fair. Fletcher
                   didn't mean to insult me."

                   and Fletcher is very, very
                   sorry."
          Fletcher smiles.   It looks like he's off the hook, until--


                    Isn't that right, Fletcher?


                        
                   Uh -- not really, no.

                    None, whatsoever. I mean, I ' d
                    like to respect you, and if it
                    weren't for your mistreatment
                    of the associates, your
                    rudeness to the staff, and the
                    fact that your work sucks, I
                    would.


                    But -- what about last night?


                    I was afraid you wouldn't
                    support my partnership if I
                    turned you down. Plus, I have
                    an immature need for sexual
                    conquests.

          Miranda stalks off.





          Fletcher rubs his freshly SLAPPED FACi..



          Fletcher speeds away. He pulls the blue pen from his
          pocket.


                    Gotta focus. . . gotta focus.
          He's so preoccupied that he speeds through a crosswalk and
          almost hits an OLD MAN.


                    The color of the pen is --
                    re d !      .
          But he hasn't regained the ability to lie -- he's referring
          to the RED LIGHT he just ran, nearly colliding with a
          truck. The DRIVER screams:


                    What's your problem, schmuck?!


                           
                    I ' m an inconsiderate prick!


            Fletcher once again focuses on the blue pen.


                      C'mon, you can do this! The
                      color of the pen is -- RED!
           This time he's referring to the flashing red light of a
           POLICE CAR in his rearview mirror.


                     S hi t !!


           Fletcher pulls over. A POLICE OFFICER strolls up.


                     Do you know why I stopped you?


                     Depends on how long you were
                     following me.


                     Why don't we take it from the
                     top.


                    ·     
                     Here goes -- I didn't fasten
                     my seatbelt, I didn't glance
                     in my rearview mirror, I
                     didn't signal when I pulled
                     away from the curb, I sped, I
                     followed too closely, I ran a
                     stop sign, I almost hit :a
                    Chevy Camaro, I almost hit a
                    ge ezer, I sped some more, I
                    failed to yield at a
                    crosswalk, I changed lanes in
                    the intersection, I changed
                    lanes without signalling, and
                    I changed lanes in the


                    signalling while running a red
                    light and speeding.
          A long moment.


                   May I see your driver's
                   license?


                   No.




                    And why is that?


                    It's in my other pants.


                    I see. And where are your ·
                    other pants?


                    Hanging from my boss's
                    credenza.


                    Do you expect me to believe
                    that?


                    No.




                    Do you think I'm an idiot?


                    Yes -- but that's beside the
                    point! My license actually is
                    in my other pants, and they
                    actually were hanging from a
                    credenzaJ I wouldn't lie to
                    you! I mean, I would if I
                    could, but I can't!


                    I see. So you ..have no reason
                    to try and hide your license
                    from me?


                   I didn't say that. I have
                   other reasons. Seventeen
                   reasons, to be precise.
                         (begrudgingly,
                          off the
                          officer's look)
                   Unpaid parking tickets.


                   Be gentle.





          A cab speeds up to the house. Fletcher runs out. Audrey is
          headed to her car.




                    Audrey, wait!


                    Wait? You know, I just had an
                    insight into myself. I ' m
                    crazy. You call me up and .
                    tell me to wait here because
                    you'll be right over and --
                    here's the crazy part -- I
                    actually wait.


                    I can explain--


                    I missed a department meeting.
                    I. . . Did you come in a cab?


                    Yes.


                    Where's your car?




          Audrey finishes paying the impound-yard CASHIER and joins
          Fletcher, who is waiting alongside hundreds of towed cars.


                    Thank you. . I can't tell you
                    how much this means to me.


                    I can. One thousand, six
                    hundred, and fifty-four
                    dollars and eleven cents.


                    Ow.


          At this moment WE HEAR a hideous scraping noise -- and a
          TOW-YARD EMPLOYEE whips Fletcher's BMW into view and.
          parks... revealing a prominent new scrape on the door.


                    You scratched my car!


                    Where?     .


                   Right there!




                    Oh that? That was already
                    there.




                    Why, you -- you liar! Do you
                    know what I ' m going to do
                    about this?


                    What?


                         (angrier and


                    ...Nothing! Because if I take
                   you to small-claims court, it
                   will just drain eight hours
                   out of my life, and you
                   probably won't show up, and if
                   I finally got the judgment
                   you'd just stiff me anyway, so
                   what I'm gonna do is piss and
                   moan like an impotent jerk and
                 . then bend over and take it up
                   the tail pipe!


                    You've been here before,
                    haven't you?
          He flips Fletcher the keys and goes.


                    Well I can't remember when
                    I've had more fun, now if
                    you'll excuse me, I have a
                    class.
          She starts out.


                    Audrey, wait. I want to talk
                    to you about this Boston
                    situation.


                    What do you want to say?


                   You can't go. It's not fair.
                   Taking Max three thousand
                   miles away is not fair.




                    Let' s define "fair." Last
                  · night a five-year old boy was
                    crushed because his father
                    lied to him about coming to
                    his birthday party. Fair?


                    Last night--


                   -- Was none of my business.
                   When it happened two years ago
                   it was my business, but now I
                   don't have to care anymore.
                   See, that's the magic of
                   div orce . But it does matter
                   to Max. Everything you do
                   matters to him... and
                   everything you don't do.


                   All right-- now let me tell
                   you something...you're
                   absolutely right. I'm guilty
                   of all charges. I'm throwing
                   myself on the mercy of your
                   -court.
          Audrey doesn't know what to say. Fletcher seems very
          sincere, but she can't trust him.


                   I have an idea. I'll come
                   over tonight, right after
                   court lets out and play with
                   M ax. Have him invite some
                   fri ends over. We'll have a
                   game and everything. Then,
                   you and I can sit down and
                   talk.


                   We're suppose to be on a plane




                   No, Audrey. Just talk to me
                   abou t this first. Please.
                   Au drey, I've lost you. Don't
                   make me lose Max, too.


                   You're really coming?




                    This is iron-clad. This is
                    the mother of all promises.
                    What time?


                    ...Six?


                    Ten-to-six.




                    All right... only if I tell
                    Max you're coming and you
                    don't show up and I have to
                    see that look on Max's face --
                    that heartbreaking look-- it's
                    Boston, Fletcher.


                    I will be there.


          As Audrey gets in her car -- .


                   I hope so. Do you know what
                   your son was doing at nine-
                   fif teen las t ni ght? He was
                   making a wish on his birthday
                   c ake. He was wishing that,
                   for just one day, his dad
                   couldn't tell a lie.
          She drives away. Fletcher starts for his car, pensive,
          when a new thought strikes him.


                   Oh my God! That-'s it! An
                   innocent kid - - a heartfelt
                   plea-- a birthday wish! Sure,
                   it' s impossible --but it
                   'makes sense!..! If he can wish
                   it, he can unwish it!





          Fletcher marches quickly down the hall, cake box under his
          arm.



          Ms. Berry's reading a story when Fletcher enters.   Max
          brightens.




                    Dad!




                    Are you Max's dad? I ' m Ms.
                    Berry, Max's teacher!


                    Hi. Listen, I need to talk to




                    Mr. Reid, we were just talking
                    ab ou t careers. You're a
                    lawyer, aren't you?




                    Yes.


                    Mr. Reid it'would be wonderful
                    for the children to hear
                    something positive about
                    lawyers!


                    Well, actually-- ·


                    Children! .Mr. Reid is going
                    to tell us what it's like to
                    be a lawyer.
          She leads the kids in APPLAUSE. Fletcher takes center
          s tage. The children stare, rapt with attenion.


                    Uh, hi. Uh, I'm a lawyer and
                    I work at a big law firm with
                    a lot of other lawyers and I
                    do stuff in a law court.
                    Thank you.
          He starts out.


                    One moment, Mr. Reid. Maybe
                    some of the children have


                         
                    Jeffrey?




                    What kind of lawyer are you?


                    Mostly, I ' m a divorce lawyer.


                    What's that?


                    It means if you're daddy left
                    your mommy, he'd call me.


                    So what do you do?


                         (growing more and
                          more impatient)
                    I help people fight over their
                    money and their children.


                    Can't they fight without you?


                    They could but then J wouldn't
                    make a living.


                    Why would my daddy leave my
                    mommy?


                    To marry a younger woman. To
                    escape a loveless marriage and
                    have cheap meaningless sex.
                    To cling to an illusion of
                    youth as his body gives way to
                    sore backs, flat feet, spare
                    tires, gum disease, hair loss,
                    liver spots, kidney stones,
                    clogged arteries, diabetes,
                    goiter and eventual death.
          The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then:




                    Well, I think it's time for
                    fingerpainting.



          They're in the playground just outside the classroom.




                    Monster-Max.




                    Dadzilla. You came to play
                    catch?


                    No. I ' d like to, but I can't
                    right now.
          Max is disappointed again.


                    I ' m sorry I missed your party
                    la st night. How was your
                    Uncle Glen?


                    Stupid. His big nose and
                    stupid orange hair...


                    That's why he should have worn
                    make-up.
          Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh.
          Max doesn't laugh.


                    I want to play kickball with
                    my friends.-


                    Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother
                    told me about... the wish you
                    made last night. It came
                    true.
          Max is amazed.


                    Really? You mean you have to
                    tell the truth?


                    Yes.




                   No matter what?


                   No matter what.


          Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession.


                    Is wrestling real?


                    In the Olympics, yes.      On    .
                    Channel 23, no.


                    Will sitting close to the TV
                    set make me go blind?


                    Not in a million years.


                    If I keep making this face--
                         (makes a horrible


                    will it get stuck that way?


                    Uh-uh.


                   .If I go in the water right
                   after lunch, will I drown?


                    Only if you can't 'swim.


                    Why do I have to eat squash?


                    Because your mom buys it.


                   How come you're always too
                   busy to play with me?
          The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels
          awful.


                   I . . . I don't know. I ' m . . . Hey,
                   you know I'm coming over
                   to nig ht. We're gonna play
                   together.


                   Baseball?




                  . Yes! This is absolutely an
                    A-number one promise. You and
                    I -- tonight -- baseball.
          Fletcher and Max do their ritual "five" slap.


                      Now, listen, Max, I need a
                      favor from you. I ' m in a
                      little trouble today. I need
                      you to take that wish back.


                      So you can lie?


                      Not to you.


                      To who?


                      Max, sometimes grownups...
                      need to lie. It's hard to
                      explain, but i f . . . Look,
                      here's an example. When Mommy
                      was pregnant with you, she
                      gained a little weight.
                      Se venty pounds. I thought she
                      was gonna give birth to a car.
                      But she'd say to me "How do I
                      lo ok?" So I'd say, "Oh,
                      honey, you're beautiful,
                      you're glowing.11 Otherwise, I
                      would've hurt Mommy's
                      fee ling s. Understand?
          Max nods.


                      You didn't think she was
                      beautiful.


                      Right. No... Max, I don't
                      know how to get along in the
                      grown-up world if I have to
                      stick to the truth. I could
                      lose my case, I could lose my
                      promotion, I could even lose,
                      my job... Do you understand?
          Max shakes his head "no."




                      Will you help me anyway?
          A moment -- then Max reluctantly nods.


                      That's my boy!
          Fletcher opens the box, revealing a cake and candles.... He
          takes out two birthday hats. He puts one on Max and one on
          himself.


                      Now, do whatever you did last
                      night... only this time, make
                      an un-wish.
          Not really happy, Max turns to the candles on the cake. He
          takes a breath-- and blows them out.


                      I did it. ^


                      Great! Great! Now to test --




          Fletcher spots an attractive FEMALE teacher. Fletcher
          hurries to her and says something. A moment. Then she


          Fletcher returns to his son.


                      Did it work?


                           (rubbing his sore


                      Not like I ' d hoped. Did you
                      really unwish it?
          Max nods.


                      Only...


                      Only what?


                      Yesterday, when I wished it, I
                      r ea lly meant it. This time
                      when I unwished it I only did
                      it 'cause you told me to.




                         
                    Well, then do it again.        Only
                    this time, mean it.


                    I can't.


                    Why not?!


                    Because I don't want you to
                    lie.


                    I explained this to you! I
                    have to lie. Everybody lies!
                    Mommy lies, even the wonderful
                    Jerry lies--




                    But you're the only one who
                    makes me feel bad.


          Fletcher is stunned by how much this hurts.




                    Max, recess 'is over, come on
                    in.


                    I have to go.


                    I am coming over, tonight,
                    Max. You believe me, don't
                    you?
          Max hesitates, then nods.


                    I'll see you tonight, buddy...
                    That's a promise.
          Max heads back to class. Fletcher picks up the cake, looks
          at it, then dumps it in a trash barrel.





          A worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his
          office building when a MACHO ATTORNEY passes by.




                    Yo, Fletcher! How's it
                    hanging?


                    Short and shrivelled.
          Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He
          shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him
          anyway.


                    Fletcher! I'm still waiting
                    for your call. I guess you
                    must've lost my card --


                    No --


                    Or my phone was busy --


                    No --






                    Or you just forgot --


                    No --


                          (cannot be


                    Or something. So anyway,' why
                    don't you swing by my place
                    around seven-thirty!
          Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him
          resolutely.


                    Philip... I don't want to come
                    over to your house!
          A long moment, then --


                   Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's
                   this new karaoke bar I've been
                   dying to try. I'll pick you
                   up at your office! Seven-
                   thirty! !
          And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on.







          Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives
          him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her.


                   Do you want your messages?


                   No.
          He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows
          him in, leaving his door open.





          Fletcher collapses onto his couch. Greta enters.


                   Are you okay?


                   My son hates me.


                   No! He loves you. I've seen
                   y ou together. You're his
                   hero.


                   O h yeah? Last night at his
                   birthday party, he made a
                   ·wish. That I wouldn't be able
                   to tell a lie for one whole
                   day.


                   Kids...


                   It came true.


                   What?


                   It's true. Didn't it seem odd
                   to you that I kept telling the
                   truth all morning?


                   Well, yeah, but...




                    You're telling me that you
                    can't lie.


                    That's right!     I am incapable
                    of lying.



          Miranda is 'eavesdropping.    A wicked gleam in her eye,





                    Just today?


                    Apparently until 9:15 tonight.
                    It's a twenty-four hour curse.


                    Yes, those are going around.


                    You don't believe me.


                    Of course not.


                    Go ahead. Ask me something
                    I ' d normally lie about.
          She thinks.


                   A ll right. Remember a few
                   months ago, I wanted a raise--




                    Forget it. Let's not do this.


                   -- and the firm wouldn't.give
                   me one. And I asked you if
                   you would give it to me out of
                   your own pocket and you said
                   the company wouldn't permit it
                   because it creates jealousy
                   among the other secretaries?
                   Was that true or did you just
                   not want to pony up the dough?







          Greta is emptying all her personal effects into boxes.
          She's leaving. Fletcher is on the phone and looks very
          harras,sed.

                    hundred dollar suit. Don't

          Greta stops.     She seems to consider.


                    A few years ago a friend of
                    mine had a burglar up on her

          He runs directly into Miranda.


                    Aaaah!
          Miranda smiles like a cat that's trapped a mouse.


                    Ah, Fletcher, so nice to bump
                    i nto you. Are you busy?


                    Extremely.

                    please?
          Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall.


                   Fletcher, did you know that
                   the partnership committee is
                   being headed up by Mr. Allan

                    pile of cow dung.




                    How delightful!
          She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into --



          The room is filled with ATTORNEYS, including MR. ALLAN,
          the founder himself. Fletcher freezes.

                    your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you
                    remember Fletcher Reid.

          An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher.


                    Oh, that's right. You used to
                    work together. .Tell me, what
                    do you think of Mr. Allah?
          Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's
          trying to hold it back, but--

          DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous
          LAUGHTER. He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who
          looks on, STUNNED. Everyone pounds the table in hysterics.




                    Marvelous! Marvelous! That's
                    what I love most about this
                    firm-- the collegial
                    atmosphere, the hearty good-
                    fellowship!
          Miranda is incensed.


                    And thanks for those flowers
                    for my anniversary. My wife
                    loved them.


                    Well, I'm due in court... bye-
                    bye.



          Fletcher exits the conference, closes the door, breathes a
          sigh of relief, then FAINTS.   .





          CLOSE UP of Fletcher, seated alone at a table. His hands
          are on his-face. He looks totally dazed. At the other
          table, sit Dana Appleton and Mr. Cole.


                    All rise.
          They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits.

          and a NANNY.

          in PAIN. -

                   Judge is taking the bench.
          Fletcher's expression turns to terror.



          The judge settles in. Mr. Allan and a smug Miranda look on
          from the gallery.


                   You may proceed, Mr. Reid. .
          Everyone turns to Fletcher in anticipation.    In a voice
          quaking with fear...

                    up in the car.
          Virginia takes her seat, leaving her two young children
          sitting dejectedly in the gallery with their nanny.

                    sorry for them already.

          Dana Appleton questions BRYSON, a private investigator.

                    twelve, I surveilled Mrs. Cole
                    at the behest of Mr. Cole.
                    During that period, I noted
                    that Mr. Cole left each day
                    between seven-forty and seven-
                    fifty. Thereafter, Mrs. Cole
                    would frequently have a male
                    visitor arrive and stay for
                    one to four hours. I was able
                    to take several photographs of

                    did during their frequent...
                    visits?


                    Well, they were pretty good
                    about keeping the shades drawn

                    hear. I made an audiotape of

                    With the Court's permission, I
                    would like to play the tape.

          As Dana fast-forwards again, then resumes... with still
          more labored breathing, building intensity and --

          As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no-
          nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the
          tape. She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile.

          Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his
          water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak...
          when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him.
          After a momement, he grins.


                    Would the Court be willing to

          Fletcher beams. Then necessity compels him to race out.



          Fletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak
          i n legal history. Relief. Then, he looks at his watch.
          It's only 4:15. '

                    could piss for forty-five
                    minutes?!
          He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea.
          He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE
          WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally
          KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack.
          A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door.


                    What's going on in-there?

                    mind?!
          The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room.



          The judge is PISSED. Suddenly the bailiff helps in the
          severly beaten Fletcher. The entire courtroom is SHOCKED.


                    I found him like this in the
                    bathroom. Somebody beat the
                    hell out of him.


                    Who did this?




                    A madman, Your Honor.. A
                    desperate fool at the end of

                    search the building.
          A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel.


                   Under the circumstances, I
                   have no choice but to recess
                   this case until tomorrow
                   morning at nine.
          Fletcher smiles serenly -- until --


                    -- Unless, of course, you
                    think you can still proceed?
          Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid
          answering, but he can't repress the truth.




                    Can you?


                    Yes, I can.


                    Splendid. I admire your
                    courage, Mr. Reid. I'll give
                    you a few minutes to compose
                    yourself, and then we'll get
                    started.
          Fletcher looks as if he has just been sentenced to death.

                    I'11 be there. I gotta go
                    now, Max. I'll see you in two
                    hours.
          Max hangs up.


                         
                    He's really coming.
          She smiles, but she's worried. .






          Virginia approaches with her handsome lover, LAURENCE FALK.


                    Mr. Reid, you remember
                    Laurence Falk, the man from
                    the tape.


                    How are you?


                    I've slipped into the seventh
                    circle of Hell, thank you, and
                    you?
          Virginia exchanges an anxious look with Falk.


                    Shouldn't we go over our
                    testimony?


                    Well, basically the plan is I
                    walk you through the tape step
                    by step, I ask you questions--


                    And we give the explanation
                    you came up with.




                    Exactly.




                    So all we have to do is lie.
                    Sounds simple enough.


                    Do esn't it? And I'll finish
                    up with a dramatic series of
                    questions, something like...
                    "Mr. Falk, isn't it true that
                    you and Mrs. Cole have never
                    made lo--"
          But Fletcher GAGS. He CAN'T GET THE QUESTION OUT.   The
          others look concerned, but he waves them off.


                    Sorry. I'm fine. "Mr. Falk,
                    isn't it true that you and
                    Mrs. Cole have never made lo--




          To his horror, he GAGS AGAIN, .unable to form the word.


                            
                    Oh my God! I can't do it! I
                    can't finish the question if I
                    know the answer is a lie!
          At this moment Miranda and Mr. Allan come up the steps.


                    Don't let me interrupt,
                    Fletcher. I just want you to
                    know I'll be observing this
                    a fternoon. Miranda insisted I
                    see you in action.
          Fletcher shoots a hateful look at Miranda. She smiles.


                    I'm looking forward to it. Go
                    get 'em!


          Mr. Allan and Miranda head into the building, leaving
          Fletcher more desperate than before.


                   C'mon! Gotta rephrase the
                   question!




                         Respondent calls... Lawrence
                         Falk.
               Fletcher's clears his throat.       Here goes...


                         Mr. Falk, do you know my
                         client, Virginia Cole?


                         Yes.

                         relationship with my client is
                         entirely platonic, not?
               The "not" was INVOLUNTARY.       It takes everyone by surprise.

          as vain as you would also lie
          about her age. It says you
          were born in 1964. What's the
          truth? 1962? '60? How young
          did you try to make yourself?




          Wrong! I didn't lie to make
          myself younger. I made myself
          older. I was born in 1965!"

          A TOW TRUCK drives away with Fletcher's car, leaving

                      any - -
          The man turns. It's the same BEGGAR Fletcher was rude to
          outside the courthouse.


                      Change? Absolutely.
          He continues walking.


                      Could you spare some?


                      Unquestionably.
          The beggar continues on.

                      But this is a crisis! Look,
                      I'll give you ten bucks.
          The beggar pulls out a quarter and holds it up.






                      It's so shiny and new.

          A moment as the beggar thinks, then:


                      It's worth twice that to screw
                      you.
          He walks off, grinning.

                   you're going?

          Fletcher's is THROWN ON HIS ASS in the street. Mr. Allan
          has watched from atop the stairs of the building.


                   Still euphoric, Reid?
          He goes back inside.· Fletcher starts to get up when a CAR
          SCREECHES to a HALT, inches away.

          Fletcher KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS.



          Philip's driving Fletcher.


                    You're saving my life, Philip.


                    You know, it's funny, but for
                    some reason I was beginning to
                    think you didn't like me.
                    Isn't that silly?


                    No. It's not silly.       I don't
                    like you.


                    What?


                   I don't like you. I'm sorry.
                   I find you boring. I hate

                   know a good time if it sat on

                   I'm sorry. It was easier than
                   telling you how I really felt.
                   Are you upset?
          A moment, then:


                   No. To be honest, I don't
                   like you either. You treat
                   people like obstacles and you
                   cheat at charades. .




                     Then why are you always trying
                     to socialize with me?


                     You're a client. I figured if
                     I didn't try to be your
                     friend, you'd get a new
                     accountant.


                     Philip, I don't like you as a
                     person, but I'm crazy about
                     you as my accountant. I ' d
                     never hire a new accountant.
                     Never!


                     So we don't have to like each
                     other anymore?


                     Not at all.


                     All right. Sooner I get you
                     ·to the airport, sooner I can
                     dump your sorry ass off.

          Fletcher spots a door marked "NOT AN EXIT".    Goes for it
          when a FLIGHT ATTENDANT interrupts.

          The woman raises her eyebrows and looks anyway. And
          Fletcher BOLTS THROUGH THE EXIT!



          He scurries down a flight of stairs calling after the plane
          which is moving away.
          No way he'll catch it.
          Then, he sees a MECHANIC working on a MOBILE STAIRS UNIT
           Fletcher gets
          an insane idea. . .
          The worker hears an ENGINE START, looks up to SEE FLETCHER
          in the truck, driving off, TOWING THE STAIRS.


                    Hey!!      Hey!!!!
          But Fletcher's gone.





          Fletcher's DRIVING THE STAIRS trying to catch up with the
          plane. GROUND WORKERS react.
          Soon, the "stairs" are racing alongside the plane.
          Fletcher looks for signs of Audrey and Max but he's too low
          to see in the plane.
          He grabs the TOOL BOX'on the passenger's seat,-puts it on
          the accelerator, pinning it to the floor. Then, he CLIMBS




          The "stairs" sway back and forth as he reaches the top.





          PASSENGERS calmly read while outside FLETCHER speeds along,
          WAVING HIS ARMS like a maniac. The ENGINE NOISE drowns out
          his call for...

          Fletcher is BANGING on the windows. People on the plane
          POINT, STARE in amazement.
          Fletcher looks ahead, SEES the stairs about to CRASH INTO
          THE WING! Fletcher desperately fiddles with some controls.
          At the last second, finds the one that LOWERS THE STAIRS.
          He surfs under the wing...
          ...    and RAISES UP THE STAIRS at the other side.
          Fletcher's at the front of the plane, where he finally
          spots. . .


          Max has the window seat, Audrey arid Jerry are next to him.
          Audrey has on her headset and Jerry is looking for his
          seatbelt. NEITHER SEES FLETCHER.
          Fletcher SCREAMS to get their attention. But it's TOO


          Then, Fletcher looks ahead and his EYES GO WIDE!


          The RUNWAY is ENDING!.


          Just then, Max looks up...SEES HIS DAD. Audrey is now
          trying to help Jerry find his seat belt.

          BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading ·
          right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE


          And BAM!   FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING!


          Audrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A






          With all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's
          in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT.







          Fletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED.
          He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES.

          He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY
          waiting for him just outside the door.

                    That's two questions. A; Yes,

                    stopping in. I want to be in
                    his life. I don't want to be
                    some jerk that sees him at
                    Easter. I want to be his
                    father.
          Fletcher turns to Jerry.


                   I know I have no right to ask,
                   but can I talk you out of
                   taki ng that job? I can get
                   you a better job here in L.A.
                   I've got all kinds of
                   connect ions... what do you do
                   again?


                    I design security systems.


                    How symbolic. Okay great.
                    You know Pac-Tec?


                   The biggest.


                   One of their systems shorted
                   out and burned down a
                   supermarket. I got them off.
                   Another proud day for justice.
                   If I ask them they'll beat
                   your Boston offer in two
                   s ec on ds .    ..




                    Don't put Jerry in the middle.


                    It's okay.
                          
                    Boston means this
                          (snaps his


                    to me. All I want is for this
                    lady and Max to be happy.
                    Preferably, with me. Whatever
                    they want, I'll go along with.
          They both look to Audrey.


                    All I want is for Max to be
                    happy.
          Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the
          stairs. He's still upset.


                    You better know your jury.
                    You're hot exactly Max's hero
                    today.


                    Just let me present my case.
          Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,




                    I have been sent from the
                    future to destroy you. . .
                    Argghhh!
                         (no response, a


                    You mad at me?
          Max nods. Fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. Then:


                    You wanted me to stop lying.
                    But lying isn't the problem. ..
                    Why we lie ~ that's the
                    problem. Sometimes we lie to
                    make someone else feel better.
                    But sometimes we lie because
                    the truth gets in our way...
                          
                    But being an adult means you
                    sacrifice some things for more


                    important things. Much more
                    important things. I was so
                    stupid, Max.
                          (pointing to his
                           own head)
                    Malfunction in vector one.
                    All this time you've been here
                    and I could see you anytime I
                    felt like it. And I...
                    didn't. Please don't go to
                    Boston. Max, I love you more
                    than anything else in the
                    world and you know it's true.
                    I couldn't say it if it
                    weren't true. Not today.
          A moment as Max studies his father, then:


                          
                    He's telling the truth, Mom.
                    He's not allowed to lie. I
                    made a wish and anything Dad
                    says has to be the truth.
                           ..
                    Right?
          But Fletcher's looking at his watch...


                    Max. .. it's 9:22.


                    What?


                    Max, you made the wish at
                    9:15. I've been able to lie
                    for the last seven minutes.
          Max steps away from Fletcher.


                    So then, you were...


                    No! It wasn't a lie. I just
                    wanted to be honest with you
                    and tell you -- there was no
                    wish to guarantee it anymore.
                    You just have to believe me.
          Max looks at Audrey, who is letting Max decide for himself
          Max looks at Fletcher and tries to decide.




                          
                     Mommy... do we have to go to
                     Boston?
          Audrey looks at Jerry, then back at Max.


                     No.      We don't have to.
          Fletcher hugs his son -- the kind of hug that says "I'll
          never let you go."


                          
                     Can we play catch tomorrow?
          Fletcher smiles. . .



          A beautiful park with a basball diamond. Fletcher is
          seated on a bench, waiting. He's dressed in sweats, with a
          baseball glove. Soon, Jerry, Audrey, and Max pull up...


                     Dad! !


                     Ma x i mu m ! !
          Fletcher picks Max up.


                    Transformer!!! .
          Fletcher and Max do the TRANSFORMER ROUTINE again...


                     Malfunction in vector seven.
                     I have lost control of my
                     affection reflex...
          Fletcher starts KISSING MAX on the head over and over. He
          sees Audrey.


                     Procreate!          Procreate!




                     Fletcher... You're gonna lose
                     a limb--




                    Come on, dad, let's play
                    catch!!


                    Sr. . .

                    Here you go, mom.
                          
                    Oh, you mean with a ball...
          He puts Max down. Max runs into position. Fletcher stops
          for a second and turns to Jerry, man to man.


                    I take back every dirty,
                    dishonest thing I ever said
                    about you, wrote about you,
                    faxed about you, E-mailed
                    about you.


                    Appreciated.
          Fletcher tosses the baseball up and down.


                    So, you up for a little
                    friendly competition?


                   No, you go play with your son.


                   I wasn't talking about
                   basesball.
          A slow smile from Jerry. Fletcher winks and tosses the
          ball to Max.


                         
                   Alright, it's time to show you
                   the old Fletcher Reid change up.


          Fletcher winds up in an EXAGERATED SUPER FAST MOTION, then
          instantly shifts to SUPER SLOW MOTION. Max CRACKS UP.
          Audrey LAUGHS. Jerry can't help but smile, too.
          There may be better things in life... but at this moment,
          it's hard to think of a single one. Honestly.
