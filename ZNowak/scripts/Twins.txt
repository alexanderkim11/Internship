    The CAMERA is MOVING SLOWLY DOWN a long basement corridor.
    We hear a narrator  --


               On his 35th birthday, I decided
               to tell Julius Benedict the truth
               about himself...



    HOLD ON sign:   "Top Secret - Authorized Personnel Only."


               It wasn't that he was the product
               of a scientific experiment.



    A white coated scientist  is studying a
    bizarre piece of equipment that looks suspiciously like
    a milkshake blender. With him is another scientist --
    .


               An experiment designed to produce
               a physically, mentally and
               spiritually superior human being.
               I explained that to him when he
               was two years old.



    Most of them young, 20s and 30s. They are being given a
    medical examination by a group of doctors, including
    Werner.

               And it wasn't the complexity of
               Julius's parentage. He knew that
               unlike other little boys, he
               didn't have just one, but half
               a dozen fathers, all very
               distinguished men.                                   *

    Not your Hollywood type. This is obviously a lady of
    character and talent. Her name we will come to learn is
    MARY ANN BENEDICT. She is on a hospital bed and being
    readied for surgery.


              Nor was it about the
              extraordinary woman chosen to
              be his mother...



    Traven emerges, sadly shaking his head. Werner tries to
    enter the room -- Traven won't permit it.


              Julius had long lived with the
              tragic news that she died giving
              birth to him.








    As a nurse, parting the security guards, emerges and holds
    up a plump, serene, smiling baby boy.






                  What Julius didn't know, until
                  this very moment, was that, about
                  a minute after he was born...
     Another nurse emerges from the delivery room, holding up
     a second INFANT -- this one is SCREAMING with rage.


                  His mother gave birth to another
                  baby...



     The serene baby.    Any mother's joy.

     The angry baby.    Fuming.
     PULL BACK to reveal:
     The two of them are in the same crib.
     The leg of the angry baby. It suddenly lashes out,
     connects with the rump of the serene baby:
     The serene BABY.    Starting to CRY.
     The angry baby.    All smiles now.
     HOLD ON the two babies in their crib as the following
     words fill the screen:

      Werner, now 70, is bent and old. Julius, in peasant garb
      is a marvelous-looking human being.


                          (speaks with an
                           Austrian accent)

                   Los Angeles. At the same time I
                   brought you here to the island.
      Julius isn't listening.    His eyes shine.


                          
                   I have a twin brother?!!

                   I have to find him!






      Julius strides along a windswept path, followed by
      Werner. The ocean spread out below them is vast and
      empty. This island is far from anywhere.

                          
                   You've been here since you were a
                   baby -- you know nothing of
                   America --

                I know it is the cradle   of
                democracy and the land   of the
                free; besides, I speak   twelve
                languages -- I'm sure I   can get a
                job.

                   They're a simple people; rather
                   primitive, not like us.

                   My brother will look after me.





      It's a blend of modern technology and the tropical
      environment -- floor-to-ceiling book-cases, computers, a
      hammock shrouded in a mosquito net.

      Julius is hurriedly packing a small leather suitcase,
      watched by Werner.
      Werner hands over a photograph: it's a picture of a
      younger Werner, Traven, and the six fathers.

                   It's your only copy --

                   -- My need for it is only
                   sentimental -- yours may be
                   practical --
      Julius slips the photo into his suitcase.

                   Thank you -- I'll miss you.

                          (holding back the
                          tears)
                   I'll miss you.

      They hug as we --




      The water's edge. Julius, Werner, an OLDER LADY, two
      scientists and an ORIENTAL man are all saying goodbye.
      Julius puts his suitcase into a small rowboat.

      Julius then bows to the Oriental, who bows back.

                       subtitled)
               It was an honor to study under
               you, Master.
      Without warning, the Oriental tries to strike Julius in
      the face with the side of his hand, but Julius blocks
      the blow.


                      
               Ahhh, always on guard. You have
               learned well, Julius-san.
      Julius gives a last hug to Werner.


                      
               I was just thinking, maybe my
               brother Vincent is married.

                   And...?


                   Well, if a woman loved my brother
                   enough to marry him, she might
                   have a sister who'd feel the same
                   way about me. That often  happens
                   with twins, you know.

                   Julius -- please -- don't get
                   your hopes up. Your brother
                   doesn't even know you exist.

      Julius gets in the boat and casts off. The boat takes off
      like a streak. Julius, in perfect rhythm, increases the
      pace. The boat is almost flying across the water.

                          (loudly as he
                           disappears in the
                           horizon)
                   Of course he does. I've always
                   known there was something missing
                   in my life! And deep down, I'm
                   sure Vincent feels the same way!
                   He's probably just like meeeee!





      VINCE BENEDICT    lies in bed, looking extremely pleased
      with himself.     A SEXY YOUNG WOMAN is nestled asleep
      against him.     The digital bedside ALARM PURRS and starts
      to PLAY MUSIC    -- something romantic that Vince hums along
      to.

                   You sleep well, honey?

                   Mmmm... like a baby.


                   Me, too. I love this new
                   mattress. It's soft but it's hard
                   at the same time. And I love this
                   new clock.

      Carla snuggles against Vince as he surveys the bedroom
      like a house-proud new owner.

                  You've done a great job on this
                  room, Carla.

                  You really think so?   Even the
                  curtains?


                  The curtains are the key to the
                  whole thing. They're colorful...
                  they're brilliant... they're...
                  great curtains.

                         
                  You were great last night, Vince.

                           around her)
                  I think we're going to be very
                  happy here.
     Suddenly we hear a DOOR downstairs as it OPENS, and a
     man's voice drifts up the stairs:



     TWINS - Rev. 4/15/88                                 6A.



                  Honey!   I'm home!


                         (a bit surprised but
                          not panicked)
                  What's he doing back so early?

     Vince jumps out of bed, starts pulling on his clothes
     while Carla slips into a bathrobe.


                  Carla? You gonna cook me some
                  breakfast or what?


                  Be right down, sweetheart!
     Vince checks his appearance in a dresser mirror,
     straightens his Armani suit, brushes his hair, pulls it
     into a fashionable ponytail. He cuts a stylish figure.
     Noticing an expensive gold lighter on the dresser top,
     he covertly pockets it.

     Carla pushes him towards the open French doors.

                  Hurry up!   I gotta make breakfast!


                  You're wonderful, Carla. Your husband
                  doesn't deserve to kiss your feet.




     Vince steps out and  jauntily climbs over the rail. It's
     very clear he likes  the danger, being on the edge. In
     another life, he was  probably Errol Flynn. Now, he gives
     Carla an Errol Flynn  smile --
     -- and with that, he leaps into space!





     As Vince gracefully lands, bounces off it onto the ground.
     He bends, picks up a flower, puts it in the outside
     pocket of his Armani suit, heads toward a new Mustang          *
     parked not far away.




     As Vince gets in, starting to sing.


                      (he's got a good
                       voice)
               'Oh what a beautiful morning,
               Oh what a beautiful day'...
     Now he does something surprising -- not starting to drive,
     we expect that. What we don't expect is his destination
     -- because what he does is simply turn the nearest corner
     and drive right back to the house he just snuck out of.

                      (exiting the car,
                       still singing)
               ... 'everything's going my way'...




     where Carla, in her robe, is working away starting to
     make breakfast. Vince enters, gives her the sweetest
     smile.

               Carla, what a joy to look at you.

     The kitchen    door opens and AL GRECO enters. He is sing-

                  A lighter, just like yours.   I

       Vincent approaches the BMW and pretends to be searching
       for his keys while he waits for another car to pull out
       and drive away. The second it's gone, Vince deftly opens
       the BMW door with a "slim-Jim." He gets behind the wheel,
       hot wires the ignition and drives away. Vince is a pro.



       The green BMW is already being repainted by some Men
       wearing goggles and using spray guns. Vince comes out of
       an office, counting a wad of bills, followed by the OWNER
       of the chop shop.

     Coming down the aisle, checking the passengers, as we
     hear:


                      
               'Put on your red dress, baby

     A few passengers turn and look back at --



     seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo
     suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on
     and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and
     his head bobbing.

                      
               'I better wear some boxing gloves,
               In case some fool might want to

     The STEWARDESS removes his headphones and considers
     Julius with amusement.

               I knew you were trouble the second
               I laid eyes on you.
     Julius stares up at her, speechless and mesmerized.

     She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while
     Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage.

     As the Stewardess heads back up the aisle, a MAN jumps
     up, grabs her around the neck with one arm and brandishes
     a gun in his other hand.

     His back is totally to Julius now.



     turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's
     clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap.

     The gun at the panicked Stewardess's head, he continues
     slowly up the aisle, shouting for everyone to freeze, not
     even to think about moving --

     hits him in the back of the neck and he goes limp, fall-
     ing across some seats, the gun dropping from his hand.

     grabbing him, all of them brave and heroic -- a lot of

     sits back in his seat.

     In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass-
     engers hold the Highjacker, almost arguing over who's in
     control. Julius looks at them a moment, puts on his
     headset, closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the
     music.

     As Vince sidles into a booth, watched by a BARTENDER who
     clearly dislikes him.


               It's him.    He's back.

     A pretty young cocktail waitress called MARNIE turns and
     stares daggers at Vince. Marnie is a fireball of a girl,
     all brass and sass on the outside and sweet as cotton
     candy on the inside, sort of a Jean Harlow valley girl.
     She approaches Vince, who greets her with effusive
     warmth.

               Marnie! How are you?        Is your                       *

     Marnie pointedly scoops up the tip left by the previous
     occupants of the booth.

     Marnie starts to wipe down the table, spilling crumbs into
     his lap.

               You total Linda's car. You pawn                           *

               What an amazing memory --

     Marnie's sister, LINDA, also a cocktail waitress, slips
     into the booth and gives Vince a big kiss. Linda,
     although just as attractive as her younger sister, has a
     completely different personality: she's trusting,
     dependent, and legally blind when it comes to Vincent.

                      
               I am so sorry for all the
               miserable things I've done to you.

                  station for a minute.

     Marnie exchanges an exasperated glance with the Bartender
     and walks away. Linda distances herself a little from
     Vince in the booth, not meeting his eyes.

                         
                  I didn't come here for a loan,

     Vince starts to rise but Linda pulls him back down.

                  What did you do, Vince?


                  I got involved in the stock
                  market.

                         
                  I promised Marnie I wouldn't give
                  you money.

     eyes.

                  Don't look at me like that...
                  Don't do that with your eyes... I
                  shouldn't even be here with you.

     A man enters. He starts looking around, checking the
     booths. He looks like a professional enforcer, which in
     fact, he is. He is also the smallest of the Klane

      The back door opens and Vince crawls out on hands and
      knees. His journey abruptly ends as he now faces KLANE

      Vince is thrown in, forcefully, into a table.        He crashes

      with the two Klane brothers. He hands over the money he
      picked up from the BMW -- $4000. The smaller Klane counts
      it quickly.

       Vince brushes himself off, hesitates a moment, pulling on
       his left ear with his right hand.

       Immediately behind him, facing the opposite direction, is
       another man, also pulling on his left ear with his right
       hand. It is Julius --

       crowds of tourists walking this way, that way, and there's
       noise and litter and one more thing --
       -- There's Julius, case in hand, staring around, taking it
       all in. We're a long way from his island now. He studies
       all the humanity swirling around him --




       And you can see it on his face:   He loves it.

       Julius, eating a hot dog, is walking along a street in

      the expensive-looking leather-edged suitcase he carries in

      grabs the   handle of the leather case that Julius holds,
      his plan   quite obvious -- to steal the case and disappear
      into the   crowded street.
      Not an original plan, certainly, but one that over and
      over again, always works --




      Julius's hand holds fast to it.    Then --




      As his mouth drops open as we --




      just sort of standing there, no big deal, not much effort
      showing on his face as Biker #2 begins to slowly rise
      into the air as he and his cycle are about to be parted
      and then --





      still holding to the case as his CYCLE ZOOMS away from
      him and for a moment he is flat in mid-air, parallel to
      the cement sidewalk and --





      ROARING into the crowd and people shriek, dive out of
      its way and --







      falling to the pavement, his head colliding hard and he's
      out and --




      ending its trip as it collides with a storefront and
      collapses on its side, MOTOR still ROARING but no
      movement anymore and --




      stunned, going to his unconscious partner.

                          
                   What the hell did you do?
      Julius calmly kneels beside the still form. He puts
      his case down, and his hands move expertly across the
      prone figure.


                I did nothing, the pavement was
                his enemy.





      eyes almost closed as his skilled hands touch the guy a

                 I would say -- a concussion -- a
                 mild shoulder separation, and ribs
four to seven are cracked.

      metal cots. He points to a cot near the door and smiles
      fondly.

     rummaging through it, watched by Julius.


               Tell me about him. Was he a good

                  I'm certain that God had a purpose
                  when he created Vincent Benedict,

     She locates a file, removes it; the only thing inside it
     is a photograph, which falls to her desk.

                  That's odd... the contents of his
                  file are missing.
     Julius picks up the photo -- a 13-year-old boy leering up
     at an attractive young nun.

     A bunch of people are in the cell along with Vince. Most

     Julius is already seated in one of the cubicles, separated
     by a glass partition from the prisoner's side. This is
     a big moment for Julius and he looks around as various
     prisoners are brought in --
     -- and as a look of pleasure comes across his face --




     leading an attractive, powerful inmate into the room.
     The guy is Julius's age.




     trying to fight his excitement, watching as the prisoner
     moves toward him --
     -- then past him.

     Julius, confused, stares for a moment straight ahead
     across the partition, and now he's more confused --

     -- because Vince is sitting across from him, dubiously
     studying him, arms crossed. There are phones on both
     sides of the glass partition. The room, it should be
     noted, is busy.

     side of the cubicle and sits, he is overcome with the
     wonder of it all.

     look of dubiousness is gone. He picks up the phone on
     his side, gestures for Julius to do the same. As Julius
     does, Vince at last speaks:

      As Julius counts out almost the last of his money to the
      police attendant, who hands him a set of keys. Vince
      grabs them and walks out of the building. Julius
      follows.

                   No, you don't.

      This is exactly what Vince has been thinking.


                   Actually, I was thinking I'm going
                   to need some more money -- to put

                   We're brothers -- right?
      Julius tries to drape an arm around Vince's shoulder.
      Vince gives him a look. Julius drops his arm.




      Vince and Julius are walking down a long line of cars.

      Which is what Julius is pointing at.

      Vince unlocks his side, gets in. Julius, smiling and
      happy, starts to walk around to the other side.


                          
                   I'm so excited -- we'll go to

                   together -- play chess together --

                -- Get lost together --
      And on that, he GUNS his CAR the hell away, leaving
      Julius standing there.





      Deserted, alone in the sea of cars.



      As a gleaming new Cadillac rolls up to the ticket booth.
      Al leans out from the booth, taking in the car and its
      occupants -- two men, one in a Hawaiian shirt, one in a
      tanktop, both wearing Ray-Bans. They look like they're
      going on vacation.

                   Hey, the new Sedan DeVille... Very
                   nice.
      The driver, GARFIELD, just nods, holds out his hand for
      the ticket.


                   You guys must be going to Hawaii,
                   huh? Catch that good surf.


                   Something like that.
      The two men just stare straight ahead, uninterested in
      conversation. Al hands the driver a ticket.


                   There's plenty of space on level
                   four.
      The Cadillac accelerates up the ramp.



      as it pulls into a parking spot in the enclosed lot.
      Man #2, LARSON, opens an attache case, removes a
      cassette, inserts it into the tape deck while the driver
      wipes down the steering wheel, gearshift, etc. with a
      cloth to remove their fingerprints.



      as the men get out, lock the car, wipe off the door
      handles, and then head for the elevator.






      As Vince approaches a door on which a sign reads:






      His door opens and out come two furniture MOVERS with a
      desk.

                   you're six months behind.

      He opens a desk drawer, pulls out a razor and begins
      shaving as he walks into his office.


      Almost nothing is left but the phone on the floor, with
      Miss Busby, his secretary, standing by it. Vince is
      stunned.


                   I tried to stop them, Mr. Benedict --

     She takes her purse, smiles, goes.    When he's alone,
     into phone:

                  Great, I'll be right over.
     Vince drops to his knees in order to replace the phone
     into its receiver. He then scrambles up, straightens his
     suit, heads for the door, making sure his pony tail is
     perfect.





     As Vince exits, turns, quickly locks the door, turns back
     into the corridor just in time for this --

     -- A huge fist slams brutally into his stomach.     Vince
     gags, falls to his knees as we:
     PULL BACK to reveal MORRIS KLANE, the biggest of them all,
     standing over Vince.


                  Time's up, Vincent -- Got the
                  money?



     TWINS - Rev. 4/15/88                                     41.


     He bends over, picks Vince up by the neck like a toy doll,
     straightens him up briefly, then buries his fist into
     Vince's gut. Vince goes down. Harder than last time.                *




     In agony, on his knees. It hurts to breath.       He finally
     manages to look up at the giant --


                         
                  Did you hit me yet? 'Cause I
                  didn't feel nothin'.




     He grabs Vince again.


                  You gotta understand something,
                  Benedict -- I like my work.
     He pulls  Vince groggily up and this time he's going for
     Vince's  face. He takes his time setting Vince up,
     getting  his chin at just the right angle. He's concen-
     trating  on his work, so he doesn't pay much attention to
     the fact  that the elevator door has opened behind.

     Klane draws   his fist back and is about to drive it into
     Vince's face   when he suddenly pauses; the expression on
     his face, at   first puzzled, becomes increasingly agonized
     as we REVEAL   that --



     Behind him, is squeezing a pressure point on Klane's
     neck, rendering him unable to punch out Vince. Julius
     maneuvers the Klane off of Vince and forces him down
     onto the floor.


                         
                  These are most unfriendly acts you

     Julius lets go of Klane, who gets to his feet, turns
     around, and instantly lets fly with his fist at Julius's
     face.

     Here Julius effortlessly blocks the punch and goes right
     on talking.

                  You moved too soon.
     Klane spins and aims a karate kick at Julius's head.
     Julius coolly ducks it and sends Klane crashing into a
     wall.

                  attack last. You never
                  negotiated. You don't know what
                  kind of enemy I am.

     Klane drags himself to his feet while trying to gauge what
     he's up against.


                  Who are you?

                  Vincent's brother.

                         
                  We're twins.

     Klane isn't buying it. Seeing a fire axe inside a GLASS
     CASE on the wall, he SMASHES through and grabs it.


                  You're firewood.

     Klane charges Julius, who sidesteps his blow. The axe is
     is imbedded in the wall. As Julius grabs him.


                  -- And I have no respect for those
                  with no respect for logic. You're
                  a very stupid person.







     Watching as Julius picks up Klane with both hands and
     lifts him a foot up into the air, holding him there for a
     pause.





     -- And this next is timed perfectly -- as he pushes the
     elevator button and...





     slides open and...

     elevator Klane crashes down hard just as the door slides
     shut and...

                  family!'



     Despite himself, Vince is definitely warming to Julius.

                         
                  I like it when you hit people!

                  How much money do you owe? Don't
                  lie -- we're twins, I can feel

                  We're not twins, we're not
                  brothers, we're nothing, and
                  you're only in this car because I

       Suddenly Vince bangs his forehead with the palm of his
       hand.


                    I don't know where my head is -- I
                    forgot I promised this friend of
                    mine -- Sammy -- I'd pick up his
                    car at the airport -- do me a big
                    favor, okay? Drive this car back
                    from the airport for me.

                    I'd love to.
       Julius reaches into the glove compartment, takes out the
       car manual, begins speed reading it, running his index
       finger down the center of each page.

                    What are you doing with that
                    finger?

                    Learning to drive.
       Vince isn't sure what's going on at this point. Now
       Julius studies Vince's shifting moves, the way his hands
       work the steering wheel. Now he's back to the manual.
       Now he's staring at Vince.
       Vince and Julius's heads are both in motion now --
       Julius's from the book to the wheel, Vince's from the
       road to Julius's finger. As their heads keep turning --

     Vince checks beneath the caddy's tires, then rises,
     frustrated.


               What's the matter?


               That dopey Sam -- He did it again.
               Forgot to leave the keys... A lot

                  This car was supposed to be
                  auctioned off at their charity
                  drive tomorrow. Oh, well, let's
                  go eat.


                  Maybe we should try to open it
                  ourselves...
     Vince raises his eyebrows in mock surprise.


                  You think we should do a thing
                  like that?


                  Of course -- it's for the
                  children...




     Vince inserts it into the Cadillac's driver's-side                    *

     The door locks suddenly pop up in unison.

                  Whaddya know?    Beginner's luck!




     As he takes a breath, opens the door, scoots inside --

     -- and the instant he does there is this terrible
     shrieking SIREN sound --
     -- Vince frantically scrambles around, lying on the car
     seat, trying to make it stop but he can't --

     -- and then two things happen:

      First, the car tilts and Vince is pitched unceremoniously
      forward, landing on the floor of the car under the steer-
      ing wheel. He scrambles back to the seat -- it's not easy
      because of the angle.
      Second, the SIREN STOPS.    Vince looks out the car window.





      holding the rear of the car several feet up in the air.

                   When the back end is raised to an
                   angle greater than 45 degrees, a
                   mercury switch activates the
                   automatic cutoff system. The
                   alarm's computer thinks the car
                   is being towed away and shuts off.

                   No shit...
      It's beginning to dawn on Vince that there may be more to
      Julius than meets the eye.



      The Cadillac passes by, Vince at the wheel.
      A pause.
      Now the Mustang comes along, Julius at the wheel. He
      drives terribly, stopping and starting -- jerking along.
      Julius suddenly puts his foot on the gas and roars past
      Vincent.




      Julius is speeding like a kid with a new toy. Suddenly
      the CAR PHONE BEEPS. He locates the source of the sound,
      and picks up the phone.

                          
                   Vincent Benedict's car.

                   Ya see that little dot in your

                   Hi, Vincent.


                   There's a supermarket up ahead.
                   Take your foot off the gas and
                   very -- very -- very gently
                   put it on the brake.

                   The brake -- right.




      As Julius makes a sharp turn -- on two wheels -- into
      the parking lot and comes to a dramatic squealing stop
      that spins the car around 180 degrees.
      Vince's car pulls in a moment later. He gets out, gazes
      at the skid marks as a smiling Julius approaches.


                   The brakes worked just fine!

                   Lemme tell you something about
                   America, Julius -- nobody likes
                   a smart-ass.





      Julius and Vince enter the supermarket.




      are pushing a cart down one of the other aisles. Linda
      is filling it with birthday candles, cake mixes, etc.

                   write. They're old song lyrics,
                   Linda.
      Linda stops pushing the cart and looks at her.


                   I know that -- Geez, you don't

      Adjacent to the express checkout lane where Linda and
      Marnie now join the line. Julius picks up a Playboy and
      begins speed-reading it. His eyes widen at what he's
      reading, and seeing, and when he reaches the centerfold
      he audibly gasps.

                   Excuse me.
      She reaches past Julius to take a copy of Cosmopolitan.
      Julius drops the Playboy, which falls open on the ground,
      with the centerfold revealed. Flustered and blushing, he
      bends down to retrieve it, watched by Marnie, who can't
      take her eyes off the sheer beauty of his physique.

      Julius tries to stuff the centerfold back into the maga-
      zine, but only manages to crumple it. Linda and Marnie
      exchange a look.

     Julius ignores Vince's cynicism.

                  Do you know how many times I've
                  heard stories like this? It's
                  every orphan's fantasy: 'My real
                  Mom and Dad were rich and
                  beautiful, but there was a mix-up

                  I'm telling you this for your own
                  good, Julius. It's a crock.
     Vince goes over to a trunk, rummages in it, comes up with
     a dusty mouldering folder from which he removes a yellow-
     ing piece of paper.

                  I liberated this from my file at
                  the orphanage. Read it and weep.
     Julius takes the paper and reads aloud.


                  Dear Sister Anderson, your request
                  for orphans benefits for Vincent
                  Benedict has been denied.
                  According to our files his mother
                  did not die during birth. We have
                  a current address for her at 172
                  Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles.
                  Vincent's case seems to be one of
                  simple abandonment and as such he
                  is inelligible for aid.
     Vince snatches the paper back.    Julius stares at him,
     just stunned.

                  That's right, Julius, she abandoned
                  me.

                  Vincent, if they lied to us about

                  they lied to her, too. We must

               Or else what?
     Suddenly, Vince's    living room WINDOWS EXPLODE in a burst
     of GUNFIRE. Vince     and Julius hit the floor and try to
     shield themselves    from the SHATTERING GLASS. The sound
     of a CAR SQUEALING    away outside the window.

               Everyone seems so angry in America.

                  this is about.

                  Let me explain something to you.
                  I have a reputation to uphold.
                  People put their trust in me
                  because they know I always deliver
                  the goods and I always come back
                  with the money. This whole thing
                  is making me look very bad...
                  professionally.


                  This is bullshit! The car was
                  there.

                  That's right. The parking
                  attendant thought we were off for

                  The parking attendant?

                  He liked the car. We'd put on

                  look like tourists --

                  He asked us if we were going
                  surfing. He was a jerk.

     Webster suddenly gets to his feet, smiles.                         *

       house number against the address on Vince's letter.



       An imposing security gate stands wide open as several
       cars roll through it and climb up the long driveway.
       Julius, checking the address, sprints in after them just
       before the gates close.



       As Julius jogs up to the front door. The circular
       driveway is filled with cars. Adults and children are
       visible on the grounds; it appears that a party is in
       progress. Julius rings the doorbell, which is answered
       by GRANGER, a man of about 60; he's dressed in swimming
       trunks and sports an impressive physique. He's holding
       the hand of a five-year-old GIRL.

       Julius and Granger look at one another and, for a brief
       moment, hesitate, as if each of them finds the other
       vaguely familiar.

                   Mary Anne Benedict.
      Granger reacts; he's speechless. Julius hands him the
      group photo of his mother, six fathers, Traven, and
      Werner.


                   She was my mother.
      Granger looks at the photo, then at Julius.

      Julius gently takes the photo from the Girl, looks at the
      face she pointed at, then at Granger. Now Julius is
      speechless -- Granger is one of his fathers!

                She turned me down. Said she was
                afraid to have children. She took
                it real hard when they told her
                you died. She even stopped
                painting. Did you know she
                painted?

       to him.


                    New Caddy? Let's check it out.

       As the chop shop Owner checks under the hood of the Caddy
       -- Vince moves to the back of the car and pops open the
       trunk.
       The trunk is filled with a sleeping bag that might contain
       a dead body. Vince unzips the bag, sees some kind of
       giant engine part. He tries to lift it out -- It won't
       budge.

       Vince closes the trunk --

       Vince looks at the Owner who's already counting out the
       cash from his bankroll.

                  The car's okay -- I'll give you
                  three grand.


                           (deciding and

                    Sorry -- the car's been promised
                    for a kid's charity.

                  Okay, four grand.
       As Vince starts to drive away:

                           
                    Okay -- Six thousand -- that's
                    as high as I'm going...

       A piece   of paper by the phone on which Vince is writing.
       It's got   Beetroot McKinley's name and phone number on it.
       And also   one amount: $20,000. On the desk is a map with
       Houston   circled. Vince has just finished dialing. The
       phone is   picked up before the first ring is half over.

      A huge office in Houston. We are looking at the bottom
      of a pair of fancy boots. It blocks the view for the

      Edgy. His pencil bounces up and down on the crucial
      amount, the twenty thousand.

                   Look, Beetroot -- if we can't
                   renegotiate we wither and die.

      hits the CADDY'S IGNITION and begins SQUEALING out of
      the driveway in reverse... just as Linda and Marnie's
      car pulls into it, blocking his path. Vince slams his
      hands down onto the wheel in frustration.

      Linda and Marnie get out of their car, singing "Happy

      Marnie snoops around, examines the group photo lying on
      top of Julius's suitcase. In the b.g. she can hear
      Julius singing in the shower --

      Julius emerges from the bathroom, clutching a towel

       As Webster unfolds it, reads Beetroot McKinley's name,

       CAT appears at Webster's feet, MEOWING. He reaches down
       and strokes it.

       freeze at the sound of RUNNING WATER from the kitchen
       tap.

       Webster turns and SHOOTS Burt in the foot. The two

                    you would, Vincent. What did you
                    do, escape from prison?

      dust and cobwebs. Julius and Vince take it all in;
      they're numb, while Traven seems in control again.

                   create. But you had none of that.

      Vince remembers. All the bravado about loving being an
      orphan has gone now.


                   You had nobody. Nobody to love
                   you, nobody to trust you, nobody
                   to encourage you. All life taught
                   you was that the only person you
                   could count on was yourself.

                    of my life!


                    Well, we're going to change all
                    that -- aren't we, Marnie?
       Julius, embarrassed, looks over at Marnie, who's smiling
       sweetly at him.

                    Can I ask you a question?


                    Anything...

                    Am I shit-faced yet?
       Linda, surprised, does a spit-take with her beer.


                           
                    You're getting there.
       Vince gets to his feet.

                    Please excuse me -- my back teeth
                    are floating.

       Vince exits.    Julius looks at Marnie, blushes, gets to
       his feet.


                    I better see if mine are, too.
       Julius takes off after Vince.





       As Vince and Julius approach the urinals. The both si-
       multaneously flush before unzipping. Julius smiles.

                    I was twelve and she was a nun --
                    that's real pressure.
       They both finish at the urinals and begin washing at the
       sink.

                    I got to admit it, Jules -- since
                    I met you, life is getting better
                    all the time.
       Julius, a little smashed, can't hide his feelings.    He
       grips Vince by the shoulders.


                    For me, too, Vince! Sometimes I'm
                    so happy, I want to pick you up
                    and hug you!
       Julius starts to do so, just as another man enters.


                    Hey, cut it out! Not in here!
       Julius releases Vince, who clocks the other man's
       reaction.

      Linda and Marnie, both a little tipsy. Linda suddenly
      freezes at the sight of Morris Klane scoping the room.
      Morris is still wearing a bandage from his beating by
      Julius.

                Did you tell anybody we were
                coming to Santa Fe?

                we wouldn't be coming in for a few
                days... Oh, I forgot to tell
                you -- we've been fired.


                       
                Let's go to the ladies' room.

                But we just went.
      Linda takes Marnie by the hand, just as --

                sit down and enjoy the music with
                you?




      approach the table. Burt and Bob open their jackets,
      revealing they have guns on the girls. Morris Klane
      appears behind Vince and Julius.


                This has gone way past a simple
                case of loan deliquency.

                   We want to take Vince out to the

      A long beat.


                   That's kind of drastic, don't you
                   think?

      Morris grabs Vince roughly by the arm.

                   Let's go.

                    This is no bluff -- Asshole --

       Burt gives a small head signal and two very large men
       stand up from a nearby table. They each grab one of
       Julius's arms.

       Just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as
       it begins, Julius double kicks the seated Burt and Bob in
       the head. They're out cold before they realize they've
       been attacked.
       Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front
       of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with
       each others' head. They, too, are now out cold.
       Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might,
       on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle
       his relatives. Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who
       runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it
       over the head of the now hobbling Morris. All five
       Klanes are out cold.

      Julius is unpacking his suitcase on one of the beds --
      arranging his books on the bedside table, hanging his
      clothes on hangars. Vince watches him, glances at
      his watch, and begins to edge towards the door.

                   Uh... we got cable TV, a fully
                   stocked bar, free ice -- we're
                   in great shape.

                   Where you going?

                   I thought I'd just go and tuck
                   Linda in for the night.

      Vince picks up one of Julius' heavy tomes.

                   Maybe read her a bedtime story.
                          
                   Don't wait up for me.

      Julius looks fondly at his brother as he sees him to
      the door.

                   What a day, Vincent, we visited
                   our birth place. We bought new
                   clothes. We danced the waltz.
                   We get into a fight -- We've got

      the room.

      He returns his attention to the book he's been reading
      -- something the size of a dictionary -- but can't help
      returning his gaze to the TV.
      He freezes at the sound of a KNOCK at the DOOR. Embar-

      Watched by Julius, Marnie pulls the curtains shut, kills
      the overhead lights, all the while providing him with
      glimpses of various parts of her anatomy. She gets into
      one of the beds, turns off the bedside lamp.

                   Good night.

                   Good night.
      Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed
      onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the
      other lamp.
      Silence...

                   This mattress is awful.
      Getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow
      with her as she steps over Julius, who tries not to look
      up, and gets into the other bed.

                   Sorry.   Good night.


                   Good night.

                   This mattress is just as bad as
                   the other one.

      She gets out, again dragging the blanket and pillow,
      puts them down on the floor next to Julius. She crawls
      under the blanket, turns her back to him.

                   It's alright.

      Julius strips it off and hands it to her. She puts it
      on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder. Again she
      shivers.

                   You still cold?



                   Just my legs.

                   Thanks.

      Julius reaches under the blanket, removes his bottoms and
      passes them over. Marnie puts them on under her blanket.


                   Anything else?

      bathroom, comes out with a glass of water. He hands it
      to her.

      She spills the water all over her top and bedding.

      She starts stripping off everything she's wearing.      Julius
      averts his eyes.

                   blanket? -- Mine's all wet.

                   sleep on the left.

                   Sure.
      She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly
      above him and looks him dead in the eye.

                   Can I ask you something for a
                   change?

      gently kissing him.









      Linda, dressed in a negligee, comes out of the bathroom
      area. Vince, wearing pajamas, is on the floor, legs
      curled under the bed, doing sit-ups.

      Vince is clearly unnerved by the twin emotional demands
      of Linda and meeting his mother.


                   Why don't we sleep on this, okay?

       They're both gazing up at the ceiling, bathed in after-
       glow. Marnie has obviously just had the sexual experience
       of her life. Julius is equally dazed and happy.

                 Are you sure you've never done
                 this before?

       They start to kiss and we start to hear four RAUCOUS
       VOICES singing a great old ROCK SONG a capella.

       In the mountains, which dramatically tower over a lovely,
       wide park-like area with a large adobe building and a few
       smaller satellite huts.
       The car drives up a long, dusty driveway to the entrance,
       which is protected by high gates. Our principals exit
       the car.
       They approach the fortress-like gated entrance, gazing
       around at the magnificent scenery. Both men carry flowers
       and seem self-conscious about the prospect of finally
       meeting their mother.

                    It's very beautiful, isn't it,
                    Vince?

                    Not to mention valuable -- real

                    that's a worry she won't have to
                    have in her old age.
       Julius smiles at Vince and rings the bell. A MALE
       CUSTODIAN answers the door -- friendly but very firm.

       As he starts to close the door, Vince takes charge.

                    We've come a long way. I can
                    assure you she's going to be very

       Our principals circle the wall, try a locked door to no
       avail. They'll have to go over. Julius boosts Marnie
       over the wall. Linda boosts Vince over.







       Our principals take in the scene -- a large, enclosed
       garden, with pathways, shady trees, all very lovely, with
       a great view of the sun setting against the surrounding
       mountains.

       Their attention is drawn to -- A PAINTER working at an

       Julius strides purposefully along, carrying his suitcase.
       He reaches a sign-posted intersection, looks in all di-
       rections, chooses one, begins to move. As he does, a
       CREEP starts walking along with him, eyeing his suitcase,
       just like the Biker did when Julius first arrived in

      He drives inside a large warehouse, parks, gets out and
      looks warily around. He opens the trunk, unzips the
      sleeping bag, revealing the merchandise.

                Step away from that car, Mr.
                Benedict.

      Vince turns to see Beetroot coming out of the warehouse,
      accompanied by his BODYGUARD carrying an attache case and
      holding a gun. The Bodyguard pats Vince down.


                I thought we had a deal here.

      The Bodyguard ignores him, checks out the trunk.

      Vince closes his eyes, waiting for the bullet that he
      knows is coming. When he opens his eyes the Bodyguard
      is holding the attache case open to show him the five
      million dollars.

      Vince takes the case, gazes at the money, snaps it shut.
      He can't believe he's pulled it off. Beetroot and the
      Bodyguard get into the Cadillac.
      The Caddy speeds away while Vince clutches the attache
      case to his chest and does a little dance of triumph.
      The big score at last! TWO SHOTS RING out. Vince freezes
      and sees --



      The Cadillac suddenly CRASHES against the side of another
      warehouse. It's HORN is BLARING.



      emerges from the shadows with a powerful pump action                *

      Bodyguard off the horn.
      Beetroot has a hole in his head, as well.

      Webster turns and gazes back toward Vince who is sprinting
      for safety. Webster calmly goes after him, reloading his
      rifle.



      It's filled with forklifts, cranes and various forms of
      heavy machinery. Webster enters and looks cautiously
      around.

                          
                   All I want is the money, Benedict.
                   Just give me what's mine and you

                   screwing your best friend's wife.

      crawling along the ground. He spots an open window up
      ahead at the end of the warehouse. Nearer, to his right,
      is another window, closed.

      Vince picks up a piece of pipe, aims, fires it at the
      closed window and as it breaks the glass --

      crouched near the open window, glancing back at Webster
      who has no idea where he is. Noiselessly, he slides out
      of the open window, briefcase in hand, starts to run
      away --





      moving in on the shattered window.     A bit irritated.

       As Vince puts distance between himself and the   warehouse.
       Suddenly he stops, as if he's heard or "felt"   something.
       He shakes the feeling off, resumes running...   and then
       stops again, shuts his eyes tightly, trying to   deny

       Webster. He tosses the suitcase to the ground, backs
       away. Webster approaches. Julius' hands, as before,

       A stream of gas is pouring out of the drums that Webster
       punctured whilst he was shooting at Vince. It runs in a
       broad stream across the warehouse floor, right beneath
       Julius and Vince's feet. Webster is holding his
       cigarette out, ready to drop it in the fuel and incin-
       erate them.

       Julius drops the gun and Vince slowly hands back the
       case. Webster smiles and backs off down the stream of
       gas, still holding out the cigarette. He stops at the
       very edge of the building.

                    Well, I guess this is goodbye.
       He raises the cigarette, ready to throw it.

       Webster looks up.
