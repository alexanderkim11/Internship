                                                 February 2007



          THE DESERT. Sizzling dunes. Harsh. Unforgiving.

          Afghanistan - Three Years Ago

          We hear faint SCREAMS. A man BEGGING...


           No... please... There's no way...

          Sand dunes stretch to the horizon. Nowhere to run...


           Nothing... can defeat...
          A SHADOW FALLS across the sand. Then a second. One looks
          like a Dog's Head. The other like...


           Gojira.

          HAND PUPPET SHADOWS. LAUGHTER from OTHER MEN. "Godzilla"
          pursues "Dog Head", catches him, and begins HUMPING HIM.


           Ooooh, Gojira! You the best! Me
           love you long time!


           C'mon Jensen, you in or not?

          WHIP PAN to the Puppeteer and FREEZE-FRAME ON:

          Jensen. 20's, Lennon glasses, wild blonde hair, shirt
          open. Bald eagle tattoo on his chest. RESUME SPEED:


           And get cheated again?

          WHIP PAN to and FREEZE-FRAME ON:

          Pooch. Mid 30's, black and solid. Eagle tattoo on right
          bicep, his NINE MONTH OLD DAUGHTER'S FACE tattooed on his
          left. Currently mock offended. RESUME SPEED:


           The Pooch don't cheat. The Pooch
           may lie, the Pooch may steal--



           --the Pooch may refer to himself
           in the third person--


           --but the Pooch will not cheat.


           The Pooch can rest easy, I was
           referring to Cougar.

          WHIP PAN and FREEZE FRAME ON:

          Cougar. Age unknown. Tan camo cowboy hat pulled low
          over his eyes, long hair. Sniper Rock-God. He doesn't
          say or move much. Ain't no rattling him. RESUME SPEED:

           It's Liar's Poker, Jensen, how in
           the hell is the man gonna cheat
           you at Liar's Poker?

          WHIP PAN as he asks the question and FREEZE FRAME ON:

          Roque. 30's. Close cropped black hair. If Lance
          Armstrong bred with Darth Vader. Doesn't smile much, but
          he's smiling now. The four are in



          Open air, the guys sit in the back. In the middle of the
          desert with nothing to do but wait. Roque holds the deck.


           Cards.
          The four take them. Lick the back, slap them to their
          foreheads -- two deuces , a three
          . Pitiful cards.


           Got a feeling about this one, Roque.


           Your mama had that feeling too.

          At which point, JENSEN PULLS A KNIFE...

          ...and tosses it into the center of the circle. HIS BET.
          Roque responds by tossing a .357 MAGNUM from his belt in.



           Raise you.



           That the one with the hollow points?


           Yup.


           Oh, shit, I'm definitely in then.

          He puts in a Desert Eagle. Jensen pulls a second, meaner
          looking knife. Twirling it.

           This even me up?


           Exactly how many knives do you
           have, anyway?

          Jensen grins and STABS IT down into the pot.


           Cougar - your bet.

          The Silent Man stares at the others. Two deuces and a
          three. He shakes his head at them. Before he can bet...


           Hey, losers!

          WHIP PAN to
          Clay. Mid-30's. Their leader, and you gotta be a bad-
          ass to lead this crew. Tired eyes. A weariness to him
          already. And hands faster than you can imagine.


           It's time...





          RIPPING ACROSS THE DESERT. Pooch drives, Clay shotgun,
          others in the back. Passing a COMPUTER TABLET to Jensen:



           Authenticate and backtrace.



           Send us out to the middle of nowhere
           to "wait for instructions"...



           We're good, this baby came out of
           the Kandahar Spook Station,
           controller's codename is Max.

          He hands the tablet back.


           This is an Agency gig?


           We don't get to pick what needs to
           be done.
           
           Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is
           running a terrorist assembly line
           out around the Khyber Pass--


           I'm shocked. Shocked, I say.


           We find it, we paint it for a laser
           targeted bomb. No muss, no fuss.

           For that we had to put on a
           blindfold and turn around three
           times?


           You'd rather take on fifty mujas
           with AK's?

          He upshifts a gear as the Humvee drives on...





          A terrorist looking fellow talks with another. We are...




          Our guys, now in full on Black Ops Special Forces combat
          desert fatigues, perched high above what looks like a RUN
          DOWN AFGHAN PRISON. Roque with the field glasses:


           I got eyes on Fadhil.


           Paint it.

          Pooch fires up the LASER DESIGNATOR and aims it at the
          compound. A high pitched whine as he does...


           Call me Michelangelo.

          Cougar sights down the LASER SCOPE of his LONG RIFLE.
          Just taking in the scenery. Jensen, into a field radio:


           Dropkick, this is Pinball, confirmed
           eyes on, target is designated.



          A DESERT HAWK ROARS THROUGH THE SKY, enroute to target.



           Roger, target acquired, exfil
           chopper is enroute. ETA to
           fireworks is eight minutes.



           Roger, we'll break out the earplugs.
           
           So who wants to get a game? We
           got eight minutes-

          And then, for the first time COUGAR SPEAKS. With concern:


           Boss?

          Clay immediately looks THROUGH HIS SCOPE --


          A GROUP OF CHILD-SLAVES on the ground BY THE PRISON,
          being led off a truck. The others look too. Reacting:


           Call it in.



           Dropkick, children are at target
           site, repeat, we have eyes on
           children at target site - advise.


           Hold the line...

          STATIC. Seconds tick by...

           Acknowledged, maintain position.


           Maintain position? Colonel-



           Dropkick, we strongly recommend
           cancellation of payload delivery-


           Abort order can only come from


          Clay GRABS THE RADIO from Jensen:


           Mission Controller is Agency,
           Codename Max, repeat, Codename Max,
           so get him on the horn and-


           Already have, Pinball, your orders
           stand. Prep for exfil.

          STATIC. A beat. The others stare at Clay.


           Cougar?

          Cougar takes the butt of his rifle and SMASHES THE LASER
          DESIGNATOR TO BITS! Clay, into the radio:



           Dropkick, this is Pinball, targeting
           equipment has suffered system
           failure, am calling an abort.

          STATIC. Then, a DIFFERENT VOICE:


           Well, that was stupid.

          The voice is even. Distinctly unmilitary. Almost stoned.


           Who is this? This is a secure


           Very stupid, Colonel... Franklin...
           Clay.

          Clay blinks - no one uses names on comms.


           Max? There are children on site-


           And you think I didn't know that?
           Not the sharpest of knives in the
           drawer, are you? We locked
           coordinates the moment you painted;
           delivery will occur on schedule.
           Max out.

          STATIC. Clay hits the send button to respond - gets a
          SQUELCH. Cursing, tossing the radio to Jensen:

           Shit! Jensen, call the General at
           the Firebase, get him to abort-


           Can't, they're jamming us-


           Then contact the plane directly-


           
           Negative, we're screwed!

           There's nothing we can do...


          His face, stricken. They all are. And then:


           There's something we can do.

          Clay hefts his rifle.

          The others stare at him. Automatically begin checking
          their own weapons. Roque runs it down for them:


           Five against a fortress, and we've
           got maybe six minutes before an
           airstrike sets the world on fire.


           So?


           So, I'll drive.





          WHAM! BAD GUYS firing wildly as our guys' HUMVEE PLOWS
          through the GATE!


           I guess we're going with the fifty
           mujas with AK's option after all!

          A SERIES OF SHOTS -- We see just how good these guys are.
          Cougar on his knee in the back -- snipes SINGLE SHOT KILLS --
          takes out SEVEN MEN. Roque pulls to a halt in the center
          of the compound -- Bad Guys, coming out of the woodwork
          with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. As the guys hop out:


           Pooch and Jensen, get a truck for
           the kids, the rest of us will be
           out in five-



           -airstrike's in four and change-


           -out in four. On me!


          Clay leads ZONE COVERAGE toward the building -- Roque and
          Cougar run middle -- QUICK DEATH STRIKES. Images BLAST
          fast and savage as these men KILL THEIR WAY INTO THE FORT.



          Roque calmly kicks in the door -- kills FIVE MEN sitting
          around a table with TWO YOUNG GIRLS in the middle -- the
          terrified girls run to him. The BAD GUYS have no chance --
          Fast. Precise. SPECTACULAR. Our crew takes the fort.

          MOVING THROUGH a tight hallway, they find the children
          locked in a large empty room. They start leading them
          out. One LITTLE BOY stops Clay. In PASHTUN:




          Clay checks the time. 3 MINUTES TO AIRSTRIKE...


           
           Get 'em out.

          Roque and Cougar hustle the kids toward the exit while
          Clay moves DOWNSTAIRS into the darker sublevels...



          Clay kicks in a door to find A MAN - Looming over a
          SHACKLED BOY. Unbuckling his pants.

          The Man pales. Realizing the American understands what
          he was about to do, backing away, BEGGING IN PASHTUN:



          Omar DOESN'T MOVE. Instead, he eerily raises his hand
          and wordlessly POINTS TO A CELL. In the corner. And
          Clay hears a MOAN emit from it. VAGUELY HUMAN.

          Omar lowers his arm. Goes upstairs, dragging his bear.


          Clay turns. Approaches the cell. Looks down into it...
          it's clear from Clay's face that it's SOMETHING HORRIFIC.


           ...shooooot meeee...


           You're American?


           ...Max sent you...



           How do you know that name?

           ...was IA Field Ops hunting rogue
           agents... Max caught me...

          He torture rasps and spits small chunks of death...


           Max is rogue?

          Something Horrific leans forward out of the shadows...


           You're off-mission aren't you?

          Clay just stares.


           What's the mission?

           Fadhil.


           Max doesn't care about Fadhil...
           He's cleaning up the mess. You're
           his mop. I'm the mission....

          Clay's just staring into the burning, crazed eyes of
          Something Horrific.


           Kill me...


           I can get you out-



           Already dead... Kill ME-

          BLAM! A BULLET pierces what used to be left of Something
          Horrific's CHEST. Not fired by Clay...


           Thaaaank...

          And he dies. Clay turns - COUGAR. Lowers his rifle.
          Speaks one word.


           Mercy.

          Holds up his watch. 40 SECONDS LEFT. Speaks another:

           Run.



          Clay and Cougar BURST from the fort, FIRING and RUNNING
          FULL TILT towards the commandeered TRUCK LOADED WITH KIDS.
          As they leap into the back, Pooch hits the gas:


           Jesus, you stop for coffee in there?

          As he RUNS OVER two Bad Guys trying to stop them at the
          gate. The sound of a JET APPROACHING. Roque to Jensen:


           What kind of blast radius we looking
           at?
          Jensen, calculating on the computer tablet. Shows an
          animation mock-up to Roque - huge blast radius. To Pooch:






          The Fort and the retreating Truck below us mere specks as
          the DESERT HAWK SWOOPS IN and RELEASES ITS PAYLOAD...

          A moment of silence as it falls... and then STRIKES below,
          an orange FIREBALL BALLOONING OUTWARDS...




          Ripping across the dunes, FIREBALL EXPANDING behind them...


           I think we're in the clear-

          As the fireball ENGULFS THEM.



          IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FIRESTORM: All Pooch can see is
          FLAMES through the WINDSHIELD as they plow through the
          destruction. Glances in the REAR-VIEW:


           Uh, Coug?

          Cougar's sleeve, FULLY ABLAZE. He casually rips it off
          and tosses it out the back.

          THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - The fire clears... to reveal a
          30 FOOT DROP. The guys scream as they PLUNGE OVER IT...

          WHOOMP! The Truck buries itself nose first in the sand.



          Silence. Smoke rises from a crater that was once the
          Fort. The doors of the truck creak open. Most of the
          YOUNGSTERS GIGGLE. Fun ride. As the guys help them out:


           Yeah, that was great, wasn't it?
           My favorite part was when we were
           completely on fire. What was yours?

          Sounds of a BLACKHAWK CHOPPER APPROACHING...


           Exfil incoming. How are we gonna
           explain the kids, Colonel?

          Clay doesn't seem to hear him.


           Colonel?
           
           The kids. What do we tell 'em?


          A beat. Clay seems to shake off his daze as the BLACKHAWK
          sets down. Walking up to the chopper:


           Lieutenant, you're to evac these
           civvies to the Firebase immediately-


           Negative, our orders are to
           transport a five-man team only.

          Clay's eyes dart down to the Pilot's neck. A SILVER
          CRUCIFIX hangs around it. Clay, softer:


           You really want to leave twenty
           three kids in the desert to die?

          A beat.


           Not enough room for them and you...


           Then it's them.

          The Pilot nods. Our guys begin loading the kids on...




          Clay helps Omar on last. The kid looks at him. He knows
          perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement.



          Clay nods. A beat. The Pilot pulls the stick back and
          the CHOPPER ASCENDS. The kids wave goodbye to our guys.

          Omar, holding Clay's gaze as they rise. Only broken as
          the chopper begins to recede into the distance. The last
          Clay sees of him is that ratty little TEDDY BEAR...


           Cute little buggers. Hope they
           can make it to our court-martial.



           Relax, Pooch, we're not going to
           be court-martialed - if anything,
           we're going to die of thirst
           wandering the desert, right Colonel?



           Jensen, see if you can cut into
           that Blackhawk's chatter--I want
           to know if he rats us out.

          As Jensen tunes his radio...


           So, how we getting back? Hitchhike?
           Magic carpet? I say magic carpet...



           Guess they hustled up some air
           support after all - that's a
           Pakistani MiG up there...

          Jensen's tuning into the MIG's frequency. Looking nervous.


           Guys... This is bad...




           Max, Cobra One. Bandit locked,
           twelve o'clock low...
          Their eyes go wide with understanding....


           Understood, Cobra One. Kill Bandit.

          Clay and Cougar have ALREADY BEGUN RUNNING towards the
          receding chopper on the horizon. As the MIG SWINGS IN




           Fox One.

          WOOSH... The MIG FIRES - AIR TO AIR MISSILE... WHOOMP!
          The Blackhawk's tail rotor SHEARED OFF, the chopper
          spinning and falling but still intact...


          Pooch, the pilot, from somewhere SCREAMING:


           Auto-rotate, go with it, you can
           still put her down if you-




           And again.





           ...Fox Two.
          The SECOND MISSILE from the MiG SLAMS INTO THE BLACKHAWK
          proper. Burning, spinning... FALLING. Clay and Cougar,
          screaming by the time they reach the wreck...

          OMAR'S TEDDY BEAR, BLACKENING to a crisp. Clay tries to
          dive into the flames, but COUGAR DRAGS HIM BACK. No use,
          anyway...

          Nothing's alive inside.





          A safe house. A LARGE MAN stands in the shadows, watching
          as Roque, Jensen, Pooch, Cougar, and Clay yell back and
          forth at FENNEL - a CIA Handler:

           What are you talking about "MAX?"


           He set up the Operation-


           There was no operation! You were
           never radioed orders!


           I talked to him!



           You kill a friendly Afghan warlord,
           probably lose us the support of
           half the tribes in the region, and
           your alibi is "MAX?"

           Wait - are you saying you're Max?


           What?


           Colonel, Max is an Agency code for
           a rogue agent or operation-


           What are you talking-


           There is no specific Max.

          The LARGE MAN finally steps out of the shadows. Special
          Forces, like our guys. WADE. They know him.


           "Max" is catch-all for exactly
           what you've been accused of.
           Terminology's been around since
           the 50's.

          Silence as the guys take this in.


           We didn't kill those kids, Wade.
          Wade studies him. Finally:


           I believe you.

          Fennel sighs.


           Stay here. We'll be back.

          They watch Wade and Fennel leave. Now alone. SILENCE.
          After a bit, Pooch looks down. Under a little table...


           Wade left his suitcase.


          It hits them all at the same time.


           Ah, shit...

          They BOLT for the door. LOCKED. Run to the window.
          THREE FLOORS UP and it has BARS ON IT.


           
           Jensen?


           I'm not good with bombs, man-


           I don't care--Roque, Pooch, get
           those bars off!

          Roque and Pooch - SWISS ARMY KNIVES OUT. PHILLIPS HEAD
          attachments, slotting them into the SCREWS that hold the
          barred WINDOW FRAME in place...

          Jensen POPS OPEN the briefcase. Wires and dials aplenty...


           Oh, shit. Oh, shit...


           Time?

          First set of screws out, moving onto the second...


           It's a remote detonator--enough
           for them to get clear, maybe ten






           I told you, I'm not good with bombs!
           How are those bars coming?

          Second set out, moving onto the third and final....


           Hurry...



           Shut up.


           Hurry...


           Shut up...

          Third set out, ripping the frame from the window...



          WIDE ON THE CITY BLOCK: As the SAFE HOUSE EXPLODES!
          Debris flying far enough to shower the open air bazaar
          being held two blocks East. HOLD on the smoldering ruins.




          A rain slicked tarmac. MARINES carrying FIVE FLAG DRAPED
          COFFINS off a troop transport carrier. Our guys' FAMILIES
          watching. Clay's mother. Jensen's girlfriend. Pooch's
          wife and daughters. Tears in their eyes.





          Somewhere secret. Our guys' PERSONNEL FOLDERS. Each
          being opened. Each being stamped "DECEASED". BACK TO...


          As the Marines SALUTE the passing coffins. POOCH'S WIFE
          lowers her head, weeping. CUT TO:









          A nice quiet neighborhood. White picket fences, the whole
          nine. WE'RE WATCHING from outside the kitchen window of
          a Cape Cod two story. POOCH'S WIFE JOLENE doing dishes.

          Older. Hair cropped. Springfield, Massachusetts - NOW.


          She dries her hands and heads upstairs. We catch a glimpse
          of her in the upstairs hall. Then in her DAUGHTER's
          bedroom. 4 YEARS OLD NOW. Mom, putting her down.

          In the backyard, by the swingset, a figure watches. POOCH.
          Indulging in a nightly ritual...



          Mexico City. CARNIVALE. Day of the Dead. Jesters and
          masks. Music. A man with a cowboy hat walks among them.
          COUGAR. Sees Mexican Police eyeing him. Walks a little
          faster. Hat pulled low as fireworks explode above...


          Phoenix, Arizona. A late night internet cafe, wedged
          between a donut shop and spinning studio. JENSEN sits.
          Alone. Playing INTERACTIVE ON-LINE COMBAT...



          Hollywood, Florida. DOGS IN FULL SPRINT. A few thousand
          SPECTATORS. Not the Derby, but reasonably enthused.

          IN THE CHEAP SEATS -- CLAY and ROQUE. Three years older.
          But in no way bolder. They look almost... Broken.

          Roque's got his feet up. Sucks lazily on a straw embedded
          in what looks like a SODA POP. Clay's got BINOCULARS,
          following the action on the track -- Muscle shredded
          greyhounds tearing over the dirt. One crosses the FINISH
          LINE. Roque checks their ticket. Yawns.



           You lost again.


           We lost again.

          Clay's got the binoculars up, slow-checking the track.


           You placed the bet.


           You gave me the money.



           Well, that was stupid of me, wasn't
           it?

          Clay drums his fingers along the binocs as he scans. We
          see on his right hand, between his thumb and index finger -
          A TATTOO. A TEDDY BEAR. Looks just like Omar's...


           That makes, what, three in a row?


           Four.

          Something glint-flashes...catches Clay's eye. He looks
          across the track, towards the PARKING LOT.

           You know where you're messing up?
           You're putting all our money on
           the dogs with the best odds.


           Yeah, I've just gone crazy with
           that approach.

          CLAY SCANS THE LOT -- A YOUNG WOMAN in tight jeans walks
          towards a black pick up, carrying a PAIR OF BINOCULARS.


           Never play a longshot, you're never
           gonna win.

          Clay doesn't respond. Watching her. Roque exhales.

           We're at a dogtrack at 10 a.m. -
           could this get any more sleazy?


           Maybe if we were drinking.

          Roque takes a pull on his straw.


           You're not drinking?



          Clay and Roque wolf Big Macs in a 1988 Chevy Crew Cab.
          FAMILIES eat outside. KIDS play like hamsters in tubes.



           We'll stay two more days, try to
           get some of the cash back.


           Then what?


           Miami. Jai-Alai.

          Various PEOPLE walk to and from their cars. Clay and
          Roque shield their faces from them instinctually.


           I can't take much more of this.

           We're on the run. It occasionally



           I'm serious. Grinding out lunch
           money on five dollar sports bets,
           wincing everytime some overly Aqua-
           netted cow stares at my face for
           more than two seconds-

           I'm at the point where I'm thinking
           we ought to try to reach out to
           the Company...


           All we did was say the word "Max"
           and they blew up a building. CIA
           even gets a whiff of where we're
           at, they'll call in an airstrike.
           
           Until we figure out how we can
           take Max down and get clear, we
           lay low.

          A Metro Dade POLICE CRUISER rolls into the McDonald's.
          Clay watches close as it pulls into a parking spot...


           Due respect, you're nobody's Colonel
           anymore.


           Anytime you want to move along you
           go right ahead-



           Like the others? Least I still
           talk to them. You pushed them
           away. "Max this, Max that" - we
           never even saw the guy, Clay-


           We heard his voice. Guy with a
           voice is a guy with a throat. And
           if he's got a throat...



           We're hiding out in the parking
           lot of a goddamn McDonald's--You
           actually think we're in any position
           to take on some shadowy CIA super-
           spook?





           No, it's a stellar plan - we can
           use this as our base of ops!
           (gestures to the

           Pooch can run the motor pool out
           of the ball pit and Jensen can set
           up communications by the slide!

          Clay, seeing one of the COPS say something to the other...


           Go.
          Roque FIRES UP THE ENGINE as the COPS get out of the
          cruiser. Pulling smoothly into the street...



          Roque pulls up to their shitbeater Motel. Tension still
          between them. He gets out, turning back to his friend:


           I was there too. I remember. But
           he won. We lost.

           Maybe it's time for a new game.


          With that, Roque heads to the Motel. Clay looks down at
          his quarter eaten burger. He needs some real food...



          Clay at the bar, eating a steak and drinking alone. Honky-
          tonk on the juke, mix of sawdust and blood on the floor.

          A YOUNG WOMAN enters - she's hot, feels familiar. Clay
          eyes her as she orders a drink, dodges several GUYS.


           Yabba Dabba Doo...

          She catches Clay's eye. Rolls her eyes. Clay's paying
          more attention to his T-Bone than the girl. She slides
          up next to him. Her name's AISHA.


           Men.

          Clay turns back to his food. Not used to attractive women
          instigating conversation. Aisha watches as Clay eats.


           How's the steak?


           Meaty.

          She's still watching him. It's getting annoying.


           Want a bite?

           I don't eat red meat.


           Why not?


           Slows me down.


           Okay.

          Aisha studies Clay. If we've been paying close attention,
          we might ID her as the race track binocular chick. We're
          not sure if Clay does.



           You got nice arms.


           
           I know you?


           Relax, slugger... I like arms.
           That's all.


           Do I not look relaxed?


           No.

           Think we can change that?





          Clay and Aisha enter his motel room. Aisha checks out
          the sparse accommodations.



           Wow, it's everything a girl could
           dream of. Got a bathroom?


           No, I specifically requested the
           only hotel room in the world that
           doesn't have a bathroom.

           You lookin' to turn a "yes" into a
           "no" here?

          Clay points to the bathroom.



          Aisha checks herself in the mirror. A touch of lip gloss.


           So what brings you to Florida?

          Clay IN THE BEDROOM. Leans over - stretching his
          hamstrings. Does a few subtle twists - Loosening up.



           Convention.


           Convention for what?

          Shit. Clay looks around. Weakly:


           ...Air conditioners.

          IN THE BATHROOM - Aisha studies herself in the mirror.
          Stretching her arms, prepping for some physical activity...


           They have whole conventions devoted
           to air conditioners?




           You'd be surprised.

          Aisha comes back out. Both now stretched and loose.


           Bet I would. Where were we?

          They study each other. Aisha slowly moves towards Clay.


           You were about to tell me how much
           you enjoy spending time at the dog
           track...
          Aisha smiles, tracing her fingers down his stomach...


           Saw me there did you?

          Clay strokes her cheek...


           Uh-huh...


           Didn't see me at the McDonald's
           though...

          Their lips, inches from touching...



           I have a proposition for you...

          WHAM! Clay DECKS HER. She REELS BACK -- LOADED GLOCK up
          and out and -- Clay ducks left -- BACKHANDS HER with his
          forearm -- sends her FLYING across the room -- PAUSE.
          Both breathing hard. Staring at one another:


           Just hear me out. I don't want to
           hurt you.


           You're not going to.


           Yes, I am.

          He foot-plants, spins, re-attacks and IT IS ON! INSANELY
          VISCOUS: tearing the room to utter shreds. Fists
          SMASHING. A FACE KICK, plaster SMASHES.

          She HURLS a twenty six inch color TELEVISION at him.
          This EXPLODES against a wall. Sparks give to flame as
          the room starts to burn hot around these two warriors...

          They continue to fight like RABID WOLVES. And they're
          GRINNING. Enjoying this. THEN FREEZE --

          AISHA ON TOP OF CLAY -- Each has a BUCK KNIFE up and tight
          against the other's throat. Blades on skin. TIE GAME.
          Neither giving. FLAMES AROUND THEM:


           Room's on fire.

           Noticed. What do you want?


           Your life. Back.

          Clay spits blood and sucks air.


           You want to clarify that?


           Max. I can help you.


          This clearly has effect on Clay - Substantial Effect.
          Clay stares up at Aisha. FLAMES ALL AROUND THEM...


           I'm listening.



          Clay and Aisha walk away from the BURNING MOTEL.


           How'd you find me?


           It's not too tough if you know
           where to look. You guys aren't
           exactly subtle.

          A FIRE ENGINE screams past them towards the burning hotel,
          as if to illustrate her point.


           How'd you know I was alive?


           Counted the number of teeth found
           in the safehouse debris in Karachi.
           Not nearly enough for five men.


           Who else knows?


           That you're alive? Just me.

           So what's to stop me from putting
           a bullet in your head?


           You want Max and I can tell you
           how to get him.


           Max is up to something big, isn't
           he? Agency wouldn't have sent you
           otherwise.

          She gives a little smile.



           Nice try, but I'm working alone
           here. If I wasn't, I wouldn't
           need your help. Ready for the
           important part?

          Clay nods.


           There is a plane.


           Okay.


           This plane contains a truck.

           Okay.


           This truck contains a cargo.


           Right.


           This cargo is very important.


           Is this a riddle?



           This cargo belongs to Max. You
           steal the cargo, Max comes looking
           for it, you grab Max.


           What a brilliant plan, and oh, so
           simple too. What's the cargo?

          Aisha just smiles.


           Right. So you want me to steal
           some super secret cargo known only
           to you and the bad guy, and I'm
           supposed to do this because you
           know the name Max and look good in
           a pair of jeans? Sorry, sister.


          He turns. Begins walking away. She calls out after him.


           Hey!
           
           You really think I look good in
           these jeans?


           Bye...


           Cargo's heroin. Max uses it to
           fund his off the books ops. And
           it comes straight from the poppy
           fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil.
           
           Oh... does that name mean something
           to you?

          A beat as Clay stares at her, realizing...


           He used you to kill Fadhil and
           take over his operation, that's
           right. What did you think you
           were doing there in the first place?
           Fighting for truth and justice?

          Clay stares at her.


           How do I know I can trust you?


           Check my background. I'm an ex-
           Company hitter. First job was a
           junior field officer in Shanghai.
           You can Google it under Shanghai
           Hilton Decapitation.


           I mostly Google porn. Then?


           Two Chinese and an Italian arms
           dealer in Bangkok. With my hands.


           Show-off. Then?



           Then I stopped auditioning for
           you. This is a check for ten grand-

          He holds up his hand.


           We're not mercenaries.


           Operational capital, that's all.
           
           You've been waiting three years
           for a shot at this guy. You're
           not gonna get another. You want
           Max, this is it.
          He takes it. She hands him some papers along with it.


           Intel on the shipment. You check
           it out, you check me out, you decide -
           are you in or not?





          COUGAR chilling by a small fire. Working his way through
          a bottle of tequila. His blackberry rings...



          POOCH in a Motel 6 Laying in bed alone, watching an old
          Jimmy Stewart movie. Blackberry rings...


          JENSEN's in bed with TWO GIRLS from his spin class.
          Blackberry rings...







          The city midday is UTTERLY PACKED. Overflowing. The
          capital of the next great Superpower. Delhi, India.




          A TOP FLOOR OFFICE SUITE of a high end technology company.
          Degrees on the walls. A Bollywood musical BLARES from a
          TV loud enough to cover up the SOUNDS OF BEGGING...

          THREE INDIAN SCIENTISTS -- A short guy, a tall guy, and a
          really fat guy -- On the floor, BOUND, terrified, looking
          up at a tough looking bastard standing over them --

          WADE. Our burly man from the safe-house. Now he works
          for the suit in the brown French club chair. The Big
          Man, Master of Disaster, Trouble on a Firestick... MAX.


           You know we cannot do this... We
           cannot do what you ask...


           Tell me - is this a moral issue or
           a financial issue?


           A moral issue.



           Really? You object morally to
           this deal?


           Yes. I'm sorry. Please leave...

          Max takes a moment. Thinks.

           Okay, here's what I'm hearing.
           I'm hearing "No." I'm hearing
           "Leave," and I'm hearing "I'm
           sorry." Is that what I'm hearing?


           Please... you must leave...

          Max nods to himself. He thought so.


           Right. Okay, so that is what I'm
           hearing. Now, I want you to listen.
           Listen carefully because I want
           you to hear this. Wade?


          Wade hauls him up the FAT SCIENTIST. Without hesitation,
          he walks him over to the large glass window looking down
          FIFTY THREE STORIES above Delhi and HURLS HIM OUT...

          EXPLODING through the glass. As the poor bastard FALLS
          AND SCREAMS... The other scientists scream at the sight.
          Max turns to Wade, bewildered:


           What the hell was that?


           You gave me the nod.


           A "hit him in the face" nod, not a
           "throw him out the window" nod.


           I thought that's what you wanted.


           At most--at most that was a "break
           his fingers" nod.
           
           I mean Jesus, Wade, the man was
           scientific genius. Granted his
           weight signaled that he had certain
           impulse control issues, but that's
           no reason to throw his fat ass out
           a fifty story window.


           Sorry...

           
           I think I speak for everyone here
           when I say that your actions were
           excessive and, yes, more than just
           a little wasteful...

          Max looks over at the cowering scientists.


           ...then again, it seemed to have
           had the desired effect - toss Short
           Round out next.

          Wade starts for the Short Scientist.



           Wait!

          Wade stops.


           We have a different moral
           perspective than our late colleague.


           The hell you say.

           I need one to test and one to use.


           One to test?

           Of course one to test - you think
           I trust you?


           We will need much money.


           You will have much money.

          Max and Wade are up and out...



          Max and Wade, striding towards the elevators. Passing
          cubicles that Indian workers cower under - we realize
          Max's heavily armed Henchmen had SEIZED THE ENTIRE FLOOR.

           Call our people at Goliath, tell
           them we'll have a special package
           arriving on the 17th.

          He snaps his fingers and the Henchman follow...



          New Orleans. A non-descript warehouse among many.


           So this is what your girl came up
           with, huh?




          Large and empty. Clay and Roque take a look around it.


           Better than a ball pit...


           You sure you're thinking clear on
           this?
           
           I know you. When you slip, it's
           always cause of a woman.


           Name one time that-


           Carla.


           Carla wasn't the problem, Carla's
           husband was the problem-


           Carla's husband wasn't the one who



           Okay. Yes. She shot me.

           But only in the leg.


           What about Emma?


           Emma doesn't count, we never slept
           together.


           Because she put a bomb in your
           car.


           I admit, that took some of the
           romance out of the relationship.



           And now this chick, first time you
           meet her, burns down our hotel.
           Also, she kills people for a living.
           These are not good signs...


           I'm clear, Roque.

          Roque studies Clay long and hard.


           You better be. Or we're done.

          INTERRUPTED as a DOOR CREAKS OPEN - Clay and Roque
          immediately have their PISTOLS OUT facing down an entering

           Damn. We missed you too.

          COUGAR is with him. Clay and Roque lowers their weapons
          and go to embrace them... Pooch BEAR-HUGS Roque. Cougar
          nods to Clay.


           So what's this I hear about Clay
           gettin' us killed over a girl?

          From the SHADOWS:


           Been a long time since anyone called
           me a girl.

          The guys START as she emerges. All woman.

           Jesus, Lady! Ten outta ten for
           stealth and shit, but next time
           could you just knock?


           How long you been back there?


           Long enough.

           She put a bomb in your car?



           She was volatile. Aisha, meet
           Pooch, Roque, and Cougar.

          A beat as she takes this motley bunch in.


           Really? You can't hang out with
           anyone just named "Phil"?

          Another CREAK - Jensen enters.


           Hail, hail, the gang's all here!
           Colonel. Roque. Pooch. Silent
           Bob. Hottie.

           I'm gonna need a moment alone with
           the boys if you don't mind, but
           I'd like to reserve the right to
           awkwardly hit on you later?


           I'd expect no less.

           Have fun...

          The guys admire her form as she leaves. When she's gone:


           What do you have on her?


           Besides a pants-busting crush?

           Her intel checks out. The cargo
           will be arriving here in two days.



           Wow, I completely trust her now.


           What else?


           Grew up in Afghanistan, Mom was a
           local, Dad was white devil... oh,
           and CIA's got a kill order out on
           her.




           As does Hamas, Sien Fein, MOSAAD--
           pretty much everyone with the
           exception of PETA wants this chick
           amscrayed.


           Why?


           Last CIA email flagged with her
           name says she was digging for
           information about a special
           project...
           
           "Codename: MAX".
          A moment as this sinks in.


           They want to wet her cause she's
           lookin' into Max. That sounds
           familiar...



           Could those files-


           
           -have been planted for us to find?
           
           CIA timestamp, digital watermark...
           Someone would've had to go to a
           lot of trouble, and I mean a lot,
           to fool me.

          Clay nods. Looks to the others.


           I say we go with her. Pooch?

          A beat. Pooch nodding:


           I'm in.


           Jensen?



           Hell yeah. Cougs?

          Cougar nods his assent. Only one left. ROQUE. They all
          turn to him. A beat.


           For now.

          Jensen smacks his fist on the table, excited:


           Hot damn! Back with the Colonel,
           doing another bid for God and


           Country turned her back on us, and
           God can screw. This one's for us.


           And anyone who calls me "Colonel"
           better be ready to take a beating
           or an order. We ain't soldiers
           anymore.



           So what's the plan, my civilian
           brothers?


           Sleep. We start tomorrow.


           Start where?


           We're going bird hunting.





          A White Bell AB-139 CHOPPER glides into frame -- FLYING
          over a small series of white sanded jungle islands...


           It used to be so simple. A post
           9/11 world...




          HOWLER MONKEYS taunt-scream up as the chopper slow-circles
          over the beautiful deserted island. Outer Fijian Islands.


           As a country we spoke with one
           voice, moved with one purpose. We
           had a wicked boner for doing the
           right thing, and now look at us!



          Max wearing a Hawaiian shirt and Raybans. ZINC on his
          nose, rubbing suntan lotion on his forearms. To Wade:

           90 percent of the globe is tooling
           up to whack us and we're too busy
           losing our nerve to notice. It's
           Us versus Them and right now my
           money would be on them...

          CAMERA DROPPING FAST out of the chopper -- SOARING DOWN
          low -- TRACKING WITH a howler monkey up a PALM TREE --
          Then airborne as the monkey leaps twenty feet to another.


           Wasn't it Thomas Jefferson who
           once said the tree of freedom must
           be watered with etcetera, etcetera?
           We need to wake people up, Wade.
           We need to hit them in the face,
           angry up the blood, give them their
           balls back.
          We TRACK WITH our lead monkey up to something very un-
          monkey like... Something SINISTER. A metallic, trunk-
          like object. Flashing lights and transponder devices...


           We need to give them a ten megaton
           reality check.
           
           Boom Boom Boom Boom...

          A half-millisecond breath. Then, UTTER DESTRUCTION!

          A MULTI STAGED NUCLEAR SHRED BLAST -- Trees, earth, water
          are sucked in then -- HURLED OUTWARDS in a series of SHOCK
          WAVES and fire balls.


          TSUNAMIS ERUPT, as the chopper shudders from the blast.
          When the MUSHROOM CLOUD clears...



          Stunned silence in the chopper. Then Max whoops like a
          10 year old who's just seen the world's best fireworks
          show.


           I think it's safe to say it works!

          Wade, not quite as enthused. Max notices. His face falls.


           Jeez, talk about hard to impress...


          Max and Wade, stepping off the chopper as it powers down.
          Max walks towards his office. Wade, calling after him:


           The Company's with you on this?


           Kinda... Sorta...

          Wade raises an eyebrow.


           You know the drill, they don't
           like to know how the sausages get
           made. What do you care?

           I don't. Just want to make sure
           everyone gets paid.


           The money's coming from our
           Afghanistan operation. And what
           the Company doesn't know won't
           hurt them.


           Unless they're within the blast
           radius.

          Max puts his hand on Wade's shoulder. Earnestly:



           We're gonna saving our country,
           Wade. The United States of America
           will benefit greatly from what
           we're doing.


           I was born in Quebec.


           Jesus, fine - we're saving North
           America, does that make you happy?
           Just get it done.

          Max stalks away...


          A US ARMY HUMVEE tears PAST CAMERA, just missing a couple
          of freaked out jack rabbits blast-hopping for their lives.
          On perimeter patrol at 80MPH down an endless desert road...


           Base One, this is Cavalier 415.
           Sector eight perimeter clear,
           proceeding to sector nine...



          Jensen. Radio mic. His fingers rapid tap worn keys.


           
           Roger that Cav 415, we have a report
           of a civilian vehicle breakdown on
           U.S. 70, sector nine, grid four.
           Please assist as required.



          Four patrol SOLDIERS. The driver throws a hard right...


           Army of one, my ass. Goddamn Triple
           A service...



          A Kenworth Heavy pulled off to the side. Pooch works on
          the front right tire. Sweating buckets in the desert
          bake. The Humvee approaches. TWO SOLDIERS get out.



           Need a hand, buddy?

          Pooch looks up from his tire.


           Appreciate it.



          Fifty feet off the road. A brown blanket slowly rising...
          REVEAL the long black barrel of a SNIPER RIFLE.

          SCOPE POV -- Colors and graphics we've never seen before.
          Cougar's got his own thing going on. More Jerry Garcia
          than Tom Clancy. Soldier One's THROAT is smack dab in
          the middle of it. CLOSE ON COUGAR'S TRIGGER FINGER:
          Slight squeeze. Silenced weapon...



          Soldier One slaps at the burning sting in his neck.


           AAOW! Something just bit me!

          He pulls a two inch TRANQ-DART off his neck.


           
           Is this...?

          The three other soldiers see the dart and LEAP out when...

          FROM BEHIND THE TRUCK -- ROQUE rises ARMS OUT. Wedged in
          each hand -- TWIN JET BLACK .45 CALIBER COLT STUN PISTOLS.
          BLASTING AWAY... The soldiers stagger, twist and stumble
          before succumbing to the Demerol. LIGHTS OUT.




           Go.

          The sound of HEAVY IRON RELEASING as the WALLS START TO
          SEPARATE, revealing we are INSIDE THE BROKEN-DOWN TRUCK.


           Make the call.


          Jensen taps into the military emergency band. Takes a
          breath, centers himself, then...


           Base One, this is Cavalier 415!
           We have been in a collision with a
           civilian vehicle! Carvey's dead
           an' Freeman's hurt bad! He's messed
           up his neck! He can't move! Oh
           god, it's horrible! We need medevac
           immediate! HE'S GOT KIDS, BASE



           Roger, Cavalier 415! We're
           scrambling a chopper, hang in there!
          Jensen, all smiles, looks up at Clay.


           Robert De Niro who?

          Pooch and Roque have the four drugged soldiers laid out
          on the sand. All four are clearly breathing.


           Sleeping like babies.


           What about their ride?

          Clay steps off the trailer with a heavy duty air hoist.


           Flip it.
          TIGHT SHOTS of the air ram attached to the undercarriage
          of the Humvee. The tires start to lift off the ground...
          higher... Four pairs of hands start rocking the truck...

          Pooch and Jensen, on one side. Quietly:


           What do you think's up with that
           "don't call me Colonel" stuff?


           Classic loss of identity. Clay
           defined himself by his place in
           the military structure.




           It was his way of measuring the
           good he did in the world. Without
           it, he's just another loser like
           the rest of us.

          Pooch blinks, impressed. Then:


           You know there's a website where
           you can download MP3's of donkeys
           farting? How cool is that?

          A FINAL PUSH... and the Humvee FLIPS. FROM JENSEN'S RADIO:


           Cavalier 415 this is Medevac Delta.
           Be advised, we are airborne and in-
           bound to your position!


           All right, everyone get into
           character...



          Jensen and Roque LIE ON THE GROUND by the flipped Humvee.


           Lot of work to bum a ride.


           Shut up, Jensen.


           You shut up, Roque. You're dead,
           I'm the spinal injury - Spinal
           injury can talk, dead can't.


           Stop talking or I'll break your
           neck for real.


           Seriously, you have to get more
           into your role! Dead guy! No
           talking! Dead guy!

          Clay leans against the truck. In the distance, the faint
          outline of a massive DOUBLE ROTOR TROOP TRANSPORT CHOPPER.



           Here we go...



          Behind the pilot as he moves in on the accident scene...



           Base One, this is Medevac Delta.
           We have visual on Cavalier 415.



          Clay waves the chopper in. It lands on the road. TWO
          EMTs leap out and race towards the fallen soldiers. The
          first EMT kneels by Jensen.


           Alright buddy, we're gonna get you
           patched up in no time...


           Y-you ever treat anyone who'd been
           gut shot...


           Sure, in Iraq. What a mess...

          Jensen pulls his COLT, presses it up into the EMT's GUT.


           Means you know what's coming to
           you if try to play hero. Now,
           lose the radio mic, Bones.


          The two pilots wait behind full reflective face shields


           What are they jawing about out
           there? We're burning fuel--

          CLACK-CLACK. The pilots turn as TWO MACHINE GUNS jam up
          on them from out of the darkness. Pooch and Cougar.


           You heard of car-jacked? You've
           just been chopper-jacked, my man.



           You're robbing the US Army?

          TRANQ-TRANQ! The Pilots slump. Pooch, to Cougar:


           When he says it out loud, it does
           sound kinda ridiculous...

          Clay pops his head in:


           Where's my wild goose?

          Pooch reaches in and rips the chopper's TRANSPONDER OFF...


          THE CHOPPER, now UNDER A TARP on the back of the truck
          trailer. The TRANSPONDER, strapped to a SMALL ROCKET...


           We're all set here. Ready to take
           a giant step for... well, for
           guys who steal stuff, I guess.


           Hit it.

          Jensen FIRES THE ROCKET. The transponder takes off...


           Beautiful. Let 'em chase that.



           Medevac Delta, this is Base One.
           What's your situation, over?

          Pooch gets up behind the wheel.


           Time to move.

          The team gets into the big double cab. Pooch fires up
          the engine and the heave rig tears out onto the highway...

          AFTER THEY'RE GONE -- On one of the drugged soldiers.
          Trying to sit up. He looks around. WIDE: Seven soldiers
          out cold on the side of the road... Alone.



           ...Well, shit.



          Our guys are prepping. Pooch and Clay check out maps.
          Cougar, in full face mask, spray paints something big.


           ...no, what you want is a gas
           turbine generator running a force-
           fed rectifier unit, hook it up to
           the fuel tank...

          Aisha sits, watching in silence. Jensen approaches her.

           So, you grew up in the Hindu Kush,
           huh? That must've been rough.


           
           Uh-huh...


           Got any hobbies?

          Aisha, never taking her eyes off the chopper:


           When I was a girl, I collected
           human ears. I had over three dozen
           pairs when a feral dog came into
           our camp one night and took them.
           The dog was good eating, though.
          A beat.


           I'm gonna go somewhere else now.

          He departs. Aisha stands, walking over to the chopper.


           Are small arms gonna be a problem?

          Clay and Pooch look at the new girl.


           It's taken care of - we lined the
           hull with half inch steel plate.


          Roque steps forward.


           Which brings us to our next
           question...

          He PULLS a DESERT EAGLE and LEVELS IT at Aisha's skull.


           What's your angle in this?

          Aisha just smiles. Clay, more annoyed than worried:


           Roque...

           I'm giving you a chance to get
           even. That's all you need to know.

          Roque stares at Aisha. Neither backing down.


           I'm gonna shoot her, Clay.


           No, you're not.


           Yes, I am.


           No.


           Right now.

          He thumbs back the hammer... A TENSE MOMENT... And then
          Roque lowers the gun.


           See?


           She's coming with us. And if
           anything feels like a set-up, I
           put a bullet in her skull.

           Sound fair?



           Oh, completely. Now, if you'll
           excuse me, it's time for prayers.


           You're Muslim?


           You know, you are a sharp one--and
           don't let any of these other boys
           tell you different.

          With that, she turns and walks away into the shadows.
          Roque lowers the weapon. A beat. To Clay:


           I don't like this.


           I picked up on that.


           I'm with Roque, man. Agency thinks
           we're dead. We show up alive and
           kickin', start waving our dicks
           around in public, they're gonna
           make it their business to bury us.
           They'll call us terrorists, all



           What do you think we are now?
           
           Best case scenario, this gets us
           face to face with Max-

           What if it doesn't? What if we
           never get face to face with him.
           Are you gonna be able to live with
           that? Ever?

          Clay doesn't reply. A pall, cast over the guys. Finally:


           Hell, let's just say it out loud...

           We do this, we're declaring war on
           the Central Intelligence Agency.

          Silence, as the guys take this in. Then, from the corner:



           They started it.





          SWOOPING DOWN over the waterways, threading our way between
          buildings, past the islands slamming into



          A G-550, tire chalked. A fork lift removes a large VAULT-
          LIKE PACKAGE from the back of the plane -- THE CARGO.

          A fifteen ton ATTACK-STABILIZED CASH TRANSPORT RIG idles,
          surrounded by TWENTY ASSAULT TROOPERS, loading up. Machine
          guns, frag grenades, body armor.

          BY THE JET -- WADE and FENNEL, our briefcase bomb friends,
          talks with a G. Gordon Liddy wrinkle muscleman.


           As of this moment, the truck is
           designated an extraterritorial
           zone of immunity. Under no
           circumstances whatsoever are you
           or your men to allow the package
           to leave the truck before it's
           secure in the compound - to do so
           would be considered an act of
           treason and punishable as such.


           Understood and acknowledged, sir.
          As the package is loaded into the MONSTER ARMORED RIG...


           Ten men ride with the package and
           another ten ride chase.

          Ten rock hard WARRIORS in a beefed up chase van.


           Let's go.



          The two truck armored convoy pulls out of the private
          airport and passes a parked TOWN CAR...




          Clay, Roque, and Jensen watch the armored trucks pass by.
          Roque has a silenced long gun out as the second truck
          passes. As Roque PULLS THE TRIGGER...



          A silenced AIR BLAST -- we TRAVEL FAST with Roque's
          ordinance -- SMACKING SILENT onto the rear bumper of the
          lead truck. A ballistic, putty-coated recon tracker.



          Jensen's laptop GPS goes hot. Green dot indicates CONVOY.

           Are we wired?


           Like Belushi.

           Target is westbound. Heading for
           the bridge...

          Clay fires up the Town Car and follows.

          AERIAL -- LOOKING DOWN as the armored cars head towards
          the city. TILT UP to reveal the CRESCENT CITY CONNECTION --
          eight suspended lanes spanning the Mighty Mississippi...



          HIGH ANGLE -- Looking down at the bridge traffic. Sliding
          into frame, buckle-harnessed and very armed --


          TWO HUNDRED FEET ABOVE GROUND. Lashed into a BRIDGE
          SUPPORT. He racks the bolt of his NTW-20 ANTI MATERIAL
          RIFLE - a monster of a weapon with a bulky starlight scope.

          As the FIRST SWAT TRUCK reaches the center of the BRIDGE --


           Take em'.

          Cougar FIRES --

          And everything begins happening very fast.


          The SWAT TRUCK'S nearside front wheel EXPLODES, blown
          clear off the axle mount --

          The wheel spins away, bounces wild, smashes a windshield --



          The Driver, wrestling with the wheel...


           Shit, I'm losing it!

          The Truck SLEWS sideways -- PLOWS into a car! The Driver
          SLAMS the truck in reverse, FLOORS IT --


          Cougar FIRES AGAIN -- the other front wheel DETONATES,
          and the truck's nose SLAMS down on the asphalt GRINDING
          SPARKS! Going nowhere fast...



          Screeches to a hard stop behind. SECURITY CREW OUT --
          WEAPONS RAISED -- taking up DEFENSIVE POSITIONS. Ice
          cold professionals.


           Form a defensive perimeter around
           the truck!


           They're out of their minds, there's
           no way off this bridge...


          Now at the entrance to the bridge. Roque smiles as he
          hefts an MGL-40 GRENADE LAUNCHER. FIRING...



          THICK TEAR GAS EXPLODES in dark blues, billowing across
          traffic. SECURITY MEN CHOKE, lost in the SMOKE...


           Masks on! Secure the package!


           Where are they? I can't see them-


          COUGAR pumps a round into the EMPTY CHASE VAN -- Armor-
          glass BLASTING APART, showering the roadway -- Fennel
          DIVES for cover, PANICKING -- Lifts the radio to his lips:


           Code RED! We are under attack!
           Need Chopper Support right now!

          ROQUE fires another TEAR GAS GRENADE into the melee --
          CIVILIANS running and screaming -- TOTAL PANDEMONIUM --


           Acknowledged, EVAC is enroute!

          As the CHASE VAN is BLOWN APART behind them! Fennel trying
          to orient through smoke and gas. Then, a NEW SOUND...
          DEEP RUMBLING. Thick bass vibrations...

          The thick tear gas being blown aside by the thunderous
          twin-rotor downwash of a CHINOOK HEAVY LIFT CHOPPER!

          It bellies in low, the boarding ramp already lowering...

          Wade crouch-runs to the SWAT TRUCK, HAMMERING the rear



           Cavalry's here!

          The doors BURST OPEN and the SWAT Team CRASH-ROLLS the
          precious CARGO CRATE towards the Chinook's boarding ramp --


           Move! Point cover! Go, go!


          SWAT Guys laying down point cover as their comrades hustle
          the crate into the Chinook's WINDOWLESS HOLD. The ramp
          RISING as Fennel dives onboard as well...



          Wade makes a "take off" sign to the Chinook pilot who
          flips him a salute as THE CHINOOK LIFTS INTO THE AIR...

          The ramp closing. The team and cargo safely aboard...




          Passing Cougar's sniper-harness, which now HANGS EMPTY.
          Twisting in the wind.

          As we hear the rotors fade into the distance...



          Wade slumps against the burnt out wreckage of the chase
          van. Sighing in relief. SILENCE. His radio crackles:


           This is Chopper Support--we are
           inbound your position, ETA five
           minutes! Hang in there!
          As a HORRIFIED LOOK OF REALIZATION crosses Wade's face
          and he stares up into the sky...



          The SWAT Guys pull off their masks and high-five. They
          think they kicked ass. Fennel, reaching for the cockpit
          door handle... He can't turn it.


           What the hell? It's welded shut!



           The windows too! We're sealed in!


          We hear the FAINT YELLING of Fennel and the Swat Guys in
          the hold. The Chinook Pilot flips up his goggles to reveal --

          It's POOCH! AISHA sitting co-pilot. Both grinning as
          they hear the protestations from behind them...





          The middle of nowhere. A small clearing. Skeeters and
          crickets harmonize. Clay waits with Jensen and Roque.
          THE CHINOOK crests the tree line. Hovers above...




          Fennel and the SWAT Guys try to maintain balance and
          personal dignity as they stumble and fall all over each
          other... The chopper SETS DOWN. The men gather
          themselves. Weapons up. Checking clips, safeties off.


           We're down, okay! You go the second
           the ramp lowers! Hit them hard,
           three round bursts, center mass!



          Aisha clambers onto the Chinook's hull, clutching a RUBBER
          HOSE. Screws the end to an inlet valve marked "FIRE
          RETARDANT SYSTEM". Looks down at Clay. With a grin:


           Open the valve.

          TIGHT ON a 3-inch turn valve. Hard hands grab and open...




           These guys are about to get the
           surprise of their lives...

          Cut off as a CLEAR LIQUID begins to rain down on them
          from the SPRINKLER SYSTEM...


           What the hell they trying to do,
           drown us?

           Sir, that smell! It's- gasoline!

          Their EYES GO WIDE...

          HYDRAULICS WHINE. The RAMP LOWERS. The gas drenched
          soldiers BURST OUT, weapons up. Squinting through the
          fumes...

          CLAY STANDS ALONE. The men fan out around him. Multiple
          rifles TRAINED AT HIS HEAD from every direction. Fennel
          blinks, surprised to see him alive. Nevertheless:



           Eat the ground, or they blow your
           head off!


           I don't think so.


           First and only warning, Clay!

          Clay calmly LIGHTS A CIGARETTE. TIGHT ON THE BURNING
          CHERRY: The soldiers, wide eyed...


           Gasoline. Muzzle flash. Think
           about it.
          AS THAT SINKS IN -- Fennel looks like his puppy just died.

          GASOLINE DRIPS from the muzzle of his own tooled up H&amp;K
          G36 assault rifle... Clay takes a long smooth drag.


           Things'll kill you.

          A beat... and then the fight just goes out of the SWAT
          Team. They DROP THEIR GUNS and RAISE THEIR HANDS...


           Good boys. Now, let's see what
           kind of cargo you got in there.


           Clay, no bullshit - you open that
           box and we all die.
          Clay steps up to him. Near nose to nose.


           I'm already dead, remember?

          WHAP! Clay's fist to Fennel's jaw. Knocking him cold.



          TIGHT ON FENNEL as he and the Team sit bound and gagged
          in the back of the Chinook. As the ramp rises, he shoots
          panicked glances to Clay. The ramp closes between them.

          Clay turns back to


          THE CRATE on the ground in front of our guys. Pooch and
          Cougar hydro-pop the locks. OPEN TO REVEAL an interior
          crate. Smaller, polished steel. A TEN DIGIT numeric
          KEYPAD on top, and a LOGO STAMPED on the side - GOLIATH.


           Goliath the oil company?

          Clay looks to Aisha.


           It must be how he moves the drugs...


           Great. The super evil bad guy is
           in bed with the world's largest
           oil company. That's just fabulous.

          Pooch hefts a tire iron. Smacking it into his palm.


           You want me to go ask Fennel the
           combination?


           Nah, I can bypass no problem.

          He jacks his laptop into the keypad. A few keystrokes
          and HISSSSSSS...


           Voila! Ten million dollars of
           horse, comin' up!

          The second crate opens...
          Revealing a THERMO-NUCLEAR WARHEAD.

          Our guys stand there. COMPLETELY STUNNED. Silence.


           Is that...?


           Yeah.

          The TIMER display BLINKS ON and begins COUNTING BACK --





           Is that...?


           Yeah. Jensen, you're up.

          Jensen blinks. Still in shock...


           Huh?


           The bomb.



           But I'm not good with bombs...


           Get better.




           Okay. Okay.

           Nukes. That's a nuke. Who makes
           nukes? Department of Defense.
           DOD Mainframe. I gotta hack the







           It would really be good if you
           didn't talk right now- get that
           casing off for me.

          Pooch, staring at the warhead warily.


           What if that sets it off?


           Then we die thirty seconds early -
           do it.


          Aisha and Pooch with drills POP THE SCREWS. Lifting the
          casing off the bomb housing - looking down at the



           I got wires - red, blue, green,
           white, yellow-



           Okay, just hold position!




           There's also pink-

           Hold position!

          He's typing like the damn wind now -- IMAGES on his laptop,
          FLYING PAST as he HACKS THE D.O.D...




           Are you trying to make this more
           dramatic?


           Almost... Almost... Shit!


           What?

           Computer crashed!

          His screen, FROZEN.


           Are you kidding me?


           Yes, cause this is the time for







           I told you, I'm not good at bombs!


           Do you have time to reboot?



          No way. They're fucked.


           Okay, someone pick a color!



           Pull out all the wires.

           What?


           You ever hear of a clock radio
           that exploded cause you unplugged
           it--pull out all the wires.

          With no other options POOCH DOES. The clock, STILL GOING:



          The end of the wires FIZZLE. Then NOTHING.




           Opening it without the code must
           have triggered the timer...


           You think?

          And then Roque PULLS HIS GUN. Levelling it at Aisha:


           Did you know?


           I just saved our lives-



           Did you know?



           Of course not!

          Clay TURNS SUDDENLY, stalking towards the Chinook...



           Where the hell are you-


           Fennel.



          The Losers stand around Fennel, who's been CRYING. Urine
          stain on his pants. Sniveling, spilling his guts rapidly:

           Max thinks the country's lost it's
           way, gone soft in the War on Terror!
           This is his solution!

          Clay JAMS A GUN to his temple...


           Elaborate.


           He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target,
           pin it on the ragheads and boom -
           freedom is on the march again!
           The same people who want us to
           pull back will be screaming to
           turn the place into a parking lot!

           What was the target?




          BLAM! Clay FIRES - INCHES FROM Fennel's HEAD! Fennel



           The Mall of America! Christ!

          They stare down at him in disbelief...



           I'm serious! It's his sense of
           humor! He told us we could choose
           between there and Epcot Center...

          A beat as our guys take this in.



           Holy shit, it's like we were framed
           by Dr. No...


           What about Goliath?


           Yeah, what would an oil company
           want with the Middle East?



           The ships that service their
           offshore oil rigs are exempt from
           US Customs! It's how Max gets the
           drugs in and out of the country-


           This is conspiracy theory bullshit-


           It's not! There's proof!


           Where?

           Max's heroin operation - Goliath
           keeps accounts of the shipments!


           Come on, dude, they'd be morons to
           keep records of shit like this-


           It's on a stand-alone hard drive!
           It's their insurance policy against
           Max - they know he's crazy, this
           way they have something on him!



           So this hard drive - it contains
           evidence of what Max has been doing?


           Yes!

          Our guys exchange looks...


           Can you get us this drive?

          Fennel goes even paler.


           I don't know where it is! They
           don't let me have access! But-

          Fennel goes pale when he sees Clay MOVE TOWARD HIM:


           No, wait! Please don't kill-

          Clay plasters DUCT TAPE over Fennel's mouth. Stepping
          outside the Chinook. The others, going with him...



          The Warhead, still sitting there. Nobody speaks for a
          bit. Then:


           I say we hit Goliath headquarters.


           And do what - go after this non-
           existent hard drive?


           We find out if it exists. If it
           does, we steal it and trade it for
           immunity.

          Roque stares at him.


           That's your plan?


           You got a better one?




           Max gives us back our lives or we
           upload the data to the net, show
           the American people what's being
           done in their names.


           Why risk our lives again when we
           already have something to trade?

          He gestures to the WARHEAD. Clay, shocked.


           You want to give it back to him?


           I want to at least discuss it before
           signing up for another suicide
           mission on the say-so of some flunky-


           It's not happening.

          Roque blinks at Clay's abruptness. Pissed.


           So you want to take down Goliath
           now? Then who? McDonald's?
           American Airlines? Microsoft?


           You don't want Max to pay?


           I want my life back! This is
           supposed to be us getting clear -
           not saving the world!





           We're not the goddamn good guys
           anymore! I love you guys, but I
           had a life before this shit, and I
           sure as hell am not going to risk
           getting it back because you came
           down with a case of the Dudley
           Damn Do-Rights!



           Don't raise your voice at me-


           I will raise whatever the hell I
           want - you got a death wish because
           you got beat by a voice on a radio-

          WHAP! Clay throws a STRAIGHT RIGHT to Roque's jaw! Roque,
          surprised and staggered by the blow... Then he SMILES
          through the blood, DRAWING A KNIFE:


           I'm gonna cut your head off...

          This got serious quick. Pooch steps between them.
          A really dangerous beat...

          Clay and Roque, full on eyefucking one another...

          On Aisha - she seems to be DIGGING IT... Broken by:


           I say we hit Goliath. Jensen?


           Goliath. Cougs?

          Cougar nods.


           Aisha?


           She doesn't get a vote-


           
           Goliath.

          Silence. Roque, ODD MAN OUT. His fingers tighten around
          the handle of the knife...



           Put it away...

          A long beat... and Roque slides the knife back into it's
          SCABBARD. Clay, staring at him:



           You want your life back, you're
           gonna have to steal it. We hit
           them in two days.

          He stalks away. Roque glowers. Heads the other direction.


           Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad
           fight?

          Cougar grunts in response.


           So what do we do about the nuke?

           Did I just actually say that?

          On Aisha. A smile forming...


           I have an idea...



          The DESK SERGEANT sips a cup of coffee. Doing the Sunday
          crossword. Poorly. A quiet afternoon...

          A HUB-BUB outside. Rising voices.


           Holy- Sarge, come quick!

          The Sergeant rises, and we follow him through the station
          towards the front doors. Moving faster and more nervously
          as the NOISE OUTSIDE GROWS. Finally stepping out into



          The street where a CROWD has gathered. Lookie-loos with
          camcorders. The Sergeant pushes through them to find

          FENNEL. Eyes wide with fear. DUCT TAPED TO THE WARHEAD.

          A SIGN hangs around his neck that reads Death to America!
          in big cheery letters and has a SMILEY FACE on it...






          The image of FENNEL tied to the bomb, broadcast on the
          THAI NEWS on a black and white TV. Wade squints at it.


           That's gonna be a quick trial...


           Wonderful guy, salt of the earth,
           he'll be missed--who took my bomb,
           Wade?


           You're not gonna like it...

           Because I've been such a fan of
           how things have gone up till now?

          Wade shrugs and slides some PHOTOS across the table to
          him. SCREEN-GRABS from TRAFFIC CAMERAS -- CLAY, ROQUE,
          and JENSEN in the towncar during the heist. A long beat...


           Who the hell are these people?


           Colonel Clay and his unit. You
           had them killed three years ago?


           I also had several African nations
           overthrown three years ago, I'm a


           The Jamal al-Fadhil situation?

          A beat.


           Shit.


           Yeah.


           Okay, they need to get dead. Get
           me a six man fire team ready in
           twelve hours.



           So what's the plan?


           What's the plan? The plan is -
           get me a six man fire team ready
           in twelve hours.


           Okay.


           Are we now clear on the plan or do
           you want to try a third go-around?





           Because what I'm going to need you
           to do is get me a six man fire
           team ready in twelve hours. You
           get that, right?


           I get it.

          Wade heads for the door...


           And Wade?

          Wade turns back. Max, SMILING:


           We're gonna need a new bomb.



          Wade waits as FOUR INDIAN MEN climb out of LIMO. The
          first we recognize as one of the scientists that Wade did
          not throw out the window. The other three: INDIAN TOUGH
          GUYS. The scientist got smart, brought some MUSCLE.


           We appreciate you meeting us in a
           single story facility.


           No problem.




           I look at that entire incident as
           your standard "getting to know"
           each other business orientation.


           I agree. Now that we know each
           other, know, please, that if you
           come near me with any more of that
           Yankee Doodle tough guy bullshit,
           you will be fed to my dogs.

          Small smile from Wade.


           Fair enough, Doc. Can we now move
           past the verbal aggression and get
           into some business?


           You want another device. One
           billion dollars is now the price.
           One billion dollars cash.

          Wade stares at the scientist.


           That's going to be difficult.


           Life the way you people want to
           live it is very difficult, Mr.
           Wade. You want less difficult
           move to my country, study Hinduism.
           Meditate. Cultivate serenity.
           Much less difficult. You want to
           buy atomic bombs... I'm afraid
           that is a more difficult way of
           life.

          And he smiles...



          Wade drives in a Jeep, heading back to the city.


           He wants one billion in cash.

          INTERCUT WITH MAX in the SMOKED UP ASIAN BAR:



          That's a lot of a paper routes...


          Can we swing it?


          Not even close.


          The Company?


          Won't give it to us willingly...

          You get that six man team together
          like I asked?


          Yeah.


          Change of plans. Kill them.


          Kill them?


          Or fire them, whichever's easier.


          Honestly? Firing them.


          Fine, fine, I'm not a detail guy.
          What I need- wait. Did you give
          them intel on Clay's people?


          Well, yeah.


          Aaaand we're back to killing them.



          Fine, I'll kill them - what are we
          doing instead?



           Touchy, touchy. Jeez, what are
           you related to them?


           Actually, one of them, yes.


           By blood?


           
           A brother-in-law, I said I'd kill
           him, what are we doing?


           It's not what we're doing, it's
           what Clay is going to do for us...


           And that is?



           Get us our billion dollars...





          Clay. Sitting on his bed. Shirt off. Going over
          schematics - GOLIATH WORLD HEADQUARTERS. A KNOCK on Clay's
          door. He gets up, checks the eye hole. Opens it. AISHA.


           I was just going over the plan.

          She looks at him. Sexual. Predatory.


           You want to go over the plan?

          She steps into the room towards him. Reaching for her:


           Let's go over the plan...






          Clay and Aisha. After. Looking out at the city.


           So, what really happened to you in
           Afghanistan?

          Clay looks over at her. Down at the TEDDY BEAR tattoo...
          And shakes his head.



           That's not for you.

          She traces her fingers over it...

           Why do you want Max dead?

          Aisha, taken aback by the suddenness of the question.


           He's a bad man. Isn't that enough?


           No.

          A beat. She looks at him.


           When you tell me about Afghanistan?
           I'll tell you about Max.


           Fine. It's hot. There's lots of
           sand. Your turn.

          Aisha smiles at this. Shaking her head.


           Why were you alone when I found
           you?

          That takes Clay off guard. Looking out at the city.


           The guys got sick of it.


           Sick of what?



           Of hearing about Max. Of hearing
           me say we had to do something when
           there wasn't anything to do. They
           wanted to be around their families.
           Jensen has a sister. Pooch has a
           wife and daughters.


           And he hasn't told them he is alive?


           Would you? The people you loved
           the most, would you put them in
           that kind of danger?
          Aisha, side-stepping the question:


           So Roque has no one.


           He's got me.


           And you have...


           Enough hate to get us both through
           the day. He stuck with me when no
           one else would. And I ain't the
           easiest guy to stick with.

          Aisha studies him.

           If you two really fought, he would
           kill you, I think.


           You think.


           I'm almost sure of it.


           Why?



           Because you care what happens to
           the others. You wouldn't put them
           at risk to save yourself.


           And you think that's a weakness.


           I know it is. Law of the jungle.


           We're not in the jungle.

          She looks at him.

           Oh, yes we are...



          Idling. Blacked out windows. Pooch behind the wheel,
          Cougar shotgun, Roque in back. Back door slides open and
          Clay and Aisha enter. Together. It doesn't go unnoticed.


           Well, that's just great.

          That's it. Fed up, Pooch SHUTS THE ENGINE like dad in
          the family truckster.


           We're not going anywhere until you
           two squash this shit.

           Pooch, we're on a schedule here-

          Pooch takes the keys out of the ignition and folds his
          arms. Clay sighs. Looks over to Roque. A beat. Then:


           Sorry I hit you.


           Good. Roque?

          A longer beat...


           Roque?





           Sorry I threatened to cut your
           head off.


           Verrrry good. Now don't you two
           feel better?



           No.


           I don't give a shit, I do.
           
           Now, let's go watch Jensen single-
           handedly knock over the largest
           oil company on the planet...



          Houston, Texas. ESTABLISHING: Skyscrapers. One large
          one stands out -- The GOLIATH HEADQUARTERS TOWER.

          JENSEN heads towards the building. Street bicycle, bike
          shorts, messenger bag. He's disguised as a Bike Messenger.



           I got jungle fever, you've got
           jungle fever, we've got jungle
           fever, we're in love...


          Jensen enters the reception area singing. Moves to the
          receptionist desk. A PRETTY RECEPTIONIST answering phones.



           ...she's gone black-boy crazy,
           I've gone white-girl hazy, ain't
           no thinking maybe, we're in love...

          He looks down at the Receptionist...


           Yo! Package for Henderson!


          The Receptionist looks up. She's on the phone, distracted:


           Excuse me one moment-

           I'll take that, thank you.


           No can do, chica, gotta put it in
           his hands. He's gotta sign.


           
           I'm sorry--could you say that again?


           Babydoll, I'm on the clock here!

          The Receptionist looks up at Jensen, not particularly
          amused. She points towards the elevators.


           Forty fifth floor.



          TIGHT ON JENSEN as the elevator doors close on him.



           I got jungle fever, you've got
           jungle fever, we've got jungle
           fever, we're in love...




          Alone, Jensen opens the messenger bag. REVEAL A SUIT.
          Pre-set, ready to slide on over his bike clothes. Dials
          a cell phone while he dresses super fast.



           Mr. Henderson, please.



          A SECRETARY sitting in the outer office.



           Who's calling, please?




           Richard Hertz from Internal
           Security.


           One moment, please...

          JENSEN, PANTSLESS, as the elevator STOPS. The 25th FLOOR.
          The DOORS OPEN. Two SECRETARIES about to enter the
          elevator freeze at the sight of PANTSLESS JENSEN.

           Ladies... hi.

          The ladies stare at Jensen. He calculates their gazes.


           Liking the angle of the dangle?

          DOORS SHUT before they can protest...



          HENDERSON, a middle aged mid-level manager reaches for
          his phone as the secretary looks on from her desk.


           This is Henderson.



           Good afternoon, Mr. Henderson,
           Richard Hertz from Internal
           Security. If you'd be kind enough
           to make your way down to the lobby?


           Uh... Can I ask what this is about?

          Jensen is just about dressed.


           It's a matter of a somewhat
           sensitive nature involving an




           individual exposing himself to
           women in the elevators--best
           discussed in person. If you'd
           just head on down...



          Henderson plods into his elevator. As the DOORS CLOSE on
          his elevator, the DOORS OPEN on the SECOND ELEVATOR.
          JENSEN, suited and pressed, steps out. Briefcase in hand.



          Jensen enters, looking down at Henderson's secretary.

           Hi, I'm Skippy from tech support.
           Is Henderson around? I'm supposed
           to install a firewall on his system-


           Oh, you just missed him by like
           two seconds. Can you come back in
           like an hour or so?

          Jensen checks his watch. Big sigh.


           Oooooh - no can do. Upstairs
           breathing down my neck. They want
           security upgraded for the senior
           managers all of a sudden.

          Jensen, already moving into HENDERSON'S OFFICE:

           Five minutes and I'll be out of
           your hair!



          QUICK TIGHT SHOTS OF JENSEN doing what Jensen does best:
          Tearing into Henderson's computer. FROWNING...

          Henderson's secretary reaching for her phone...


           Security?




          Jensen checking his download. Smiles at the Secretary,
          then looks back to he screen. Pressing his RADIO



           According to this, the drive exists,
           Clay.

          INTERCUT WITH THE VAN: Clay shoots a look at Roque.


           You're sure?


           Abso-tootly.


           Is it in the building?


           No, somewhere off-site. It's gotta
           be a remote location, stand-alone.
           I'm checking their security logs--
           wherever they've detailed the most
           guys is probably where it'll be...




           "Skippy"?

          Jensen turns. He's face to face with a solid looking
          SECURITY OFFICER. He tries a smile:

           Show me some ID. Real easy.

          Jensen stands up, holding his briefcase.


           Whoa! Take it easy. You're the-

          WHAM! Jensen SMASHES his metal briefcase across the
          security guard's face! The guard is unconscious before
          he hits the ground. Keying his RADIO EARPIECE:


           Get me out of here, Clay...




           There's a fire exit thirty yards
           north of your position.

          Jensen, heading for it...


           Freeze like a statue, pretty boy!

          Jensen slow turns to find THREE GUNS trained straight at
          him. Major security. These guys look extremely competent.


           I'm warning you, man, I'm a lethal
           weapon...
          Jensen turns on the big fellah.


           It was this secret government
           project. They did stuff to me.
           Spooky stuff. Anal stuff. Turned
           me into a dangerous Telekinetic.
           
           As the old saying goes - you don't
           start none... there won't be none.

          Big Security moves in on Jensen with a pair of handcuffs.


           Telekinetic your way out of this...

          Jensen RAISES HIS RIGHT HAND at the guard. Fingers cocked
          like a gun aimed at the guard's Kevlar covered vest.

           Bang.

          The guard is HIT HARD, BLASTED BACKWARDS off his feet!
          Screaming in pain, he goes down. Jensen spins, aims his
          left fingers at the SECOND GUARD...


           Boom.

          ...and the second guard is blown backwards too, KEVLAR
          VEST SMOKING. Moaning:


           You broke my ribs...


          Jensen - Fingers levelled at the THIRD GUARD...


           Please- d-don't shoot...

          TIGHT ON JENSEN: Full Dirty Harry.


           Face down, or I'll make your hearts
           stop beating with my mind.

          They comply. Jensen looks down at them. Smiles. Then
          slowly turns looking out the FLOOR TO CEILING GLASS
          WINDOWS. Makes the "OK" sign out the window.


           Thanks, Coug...



          Three tight bullet holes in the glass. SMASH ZOOM out
          the window, 500 yards to a neighboring office tower...



          Rifle, still smoking. Hat low, the ever vigilant COUGAR.


           De Nada.





          Max, on the phone. SPEAKING JAPANESE. Wade pokes his
          head in. Hands him a note -- GOLIATH JUST GOT HIT.

          Max cups his hand over the receiver, as the voice on the
          other end prattles on. To Wade:


           By your boys?


           They're not "my boys". I don't
           like this. I say we grab Clay and
           kill the rest.



           If you can find them-



           I can.

          There's something in his voice. Max looks at him.
          Intrigued. Holds up a finger - let me finish up here.


           

           
           Why, Mr. Wade... methinks you
           have a secret.

           Okay. Put a fire team together.


           You're sure? You're not going to
           call me in two hours and have me
           kill them?
           
           I'm on it...





          The team gathers around as Jensen downloads the Goliath
          security specs off his computer.


           Everything on Goliath - security,
           personnel history, the works.
          Aisha's brow furrows at this. Only we notice.


           Where's the drive being kept?

          Jensen spins the laptop around to show them GRAPHICS OF


           Port of New York, baby. Total
           stand alone facility, and they're
           spending 30K a day on onsite
           security - you don't drop that
           kinda green to just guard oil.



           What are we up against?

          Jensen, typing:


           Let me check, I--oh, shit...


           What's "oh, shit"?

          Jensen looks up at them. Softly:


           They've hired Par-Sec.
          A beat. This clearly means something bad to all of them.



           Oh, shit...


           Who's Par-Sec?


           Paradigm Security Services. Ex-
           Special Forces.


           Basically guys like Cougar but
           without the warm and cuddly side.

          Cougar just glowers.

           Goliath must have brought them in
           after we hit their truck...

          Silence as they ponder the significance of a Par Sec
          security force.


           Our drive is being guarded by
           military trained, trigger repressed,
           blood thirsty, stone cold killers...
           Am I the only one who's thinking
           maybe we just chill out and go to
           Six Flags?

          Silence.



           Comb that drive for every last
           scrap of info. We're on a plane
           for New York tomorrow...



          Clay's room again. Knock at the door again. Aisha again.


           Oh, hi.

          She covers his mouth with hers...


          Jensen and Pooch sitting at a table. Both with laptops.
          Jensen tapping his keys. Roque enters, carrying a coffee.
          Stops short, seeing the others. Surprised.


           Thought you guys'd be back at the
           hotel.


           Couldn't sleep.


           Me neither. Grabbed a coffee from
           the machine - you want one?

          He slides into a chair.


           No thanks.

           You won't believe how detailed
           these files are. Every Goliath
           executive they've ever insured,
           their policies, their payouts-


           Life insurance?


           Yeah.


           What's the biggest payout?




           Gotta be wrongful death...


           Pretty much what we're gonna be
           risking.

           What are you doing up?


           Jensen hacked a satellite for me
           earlier.


           The hell you need a satellite for?
          Pooch shows him the screen of his computer - RECORDED
          VIDEO from earlier in the day. An OVERHEAD VIEW of a
          Playground - POOCH'S DAUGHTERS PLAYING. They both watch
          for a bit. The only sound, Jensen's typing. Then:


           When we first went over in 2001,
           Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted
           to do the yellow ribbon thing,
           right? Only problem was there was
           no yellow ribbon to be found - all
           the stores had been cleaned out.


           Military neighborhood...


           No doubt. And Tina's four at the
           time, and what she can't understand
           is why the ribbon's gotta be yellow.
           So Jolene sings her the song, right?
           To show her where the idea comes
           from. And when she's all done,
           Tina, four years old, looks my
           wife dead in her eye and says
           "that's the dumbest song I ever
           heard."

           So my wife and my four year old
           ended up tying a frilly purple
           ribbon round the old oak tree in
           our yard to bring Daddy home...




           Thought that counts, right?


           Yeah...




           Jolene dated a guy last summer.
           Didn't turn into anything and I
           sure as hell can't blame her, but
           that man was in my house, Roque.
           I know you're not a hundred percent
           on this op, but if it can get me
           back to them...


           I hear you, man.

          A moment between them. Broken by:



           Okay, biggest payout on a Goliath
           exec ever - 14 million and it was
           wrongful death - Vice President of
           Operations in Afghanistan, three
           years ago, paid to his daughter...

          HE TRAILS OFF IN SHOCK. Looking to Pooch and Roque:


           We're going to need to drive fast...


          Clay and Aisha, in bed. After. She traces her fingers
          along his Teddy Bear tattoo. Clay looks down at her.
          She gives him a smile. Mixing just the right amount of
          sensitivity and curiosity...


           You really want to know about
           Afghanistan?



          As Pooch TEARS through the Texas streets:



           You think she's gonna kill him?


           
           Uh-uh. No way.


           Yeah, I think so too...




           And this man you found in the
           basement - he was your true target?

           Max's true target. Yeah.


           And you spoke with him?


           He knew we were off mission. He
           knew Max wanted him dead...


           Did he beg?

          Clay blinks.


           Excuse me?


           The man in the basement. Did he
           beg for his life?


           He begged to die--why are you asking
           me this?

          Aisha smiles, trying to recover but --

          WHAM! The door SPLINTERS INWARDS and --


           Freeze!


          Roque and Pooch behind him, GUNS DRAWN. Aisha's hand
          dips into her purse and comes up with a GUN faster than
          you can spit -- MEXICAN STAND-OFF TIME:


           She's his daughter, Clay! The guy
           in the basement's daughter and
           she's got a gun and it's pointed...
           
           ...at my dick! Her gun is pointed
           at my dick!



           Would you rather I pointed it at
           your head?

           I know it makes no sense, but
           actually yes.

          Aisha ADJUSTS, pointing it at his head. As she does, the
          bedsheet falls away from her UPPER BODY.

          We don't see the goods, but our guys in the doorway do.

           Aisha watches them. CLOSE ON THEIR EYES. Nobody moves.
          Nobody breathes. And then...

          Jensen's eyes FLICK DOWNWARD. Just for a millisecond but

          Aisha pulls the trigger.

          BOOM! Jensen, falls back screaming, HIT IN THE SHOULDER --
          Aisha, moving and firing, running for the bathroom nude --
          The guys UNLOADING AT HER -- she dives through the doorway --
          HOLES PUNCHED IN THE WALL behind Clay's head as she RETURNS
          FIRE through the drywall -- Clay, diving to the floor
          below the crossfire -- Aisha kicks the BATHROOM DOOR SHUT --

          And suddenly EVERYONE'S RELOADING.

          Silence as clips are slapped into weapons until...


           Wait.

          TAPS HIS EAR. They stop. Listening... CHOPPERS.



           Shit, she's got back-up!

          Clay pulls on his pants and they run for the door...



          ...smack into COUGAR who points into the sky -- TWO HEAVILY
          ARMED COBRAS, searchlights on, headed for the motel. And
          again with that one important word:


           Run.

          The FIRST COBRA OPENS UP with it's AUTOMATIC CANNON. The
          BULLETS CHEWING UP the far side of the CHEAP TWO STORY
          MOTEL! Our guys VAULT the railing, sprinting to the van...



          POOCH, sliding behind the wheel as the others pile in...


           Go, go, go!

          Pooch hits the gas before his door is even shut. As they
          PEEL OUT of the PARKING LOT -- The STRAFING hits the GAS
          MAIN -- WHOOMP! Half the motel SWALLOWED in a FIREBALL...


           Think that got her?


           She ain't that lucky. Jensen,
           status!

           My dick remains unshot!

          Roque, looking out the back window:


           Here they come...

          Sure enough, the COBRAS are now tracking the VAN.
          Spotlights, swinging towards them...

          The asphalt behind them ERUPTS. CANNON-FIRE blowing HUGE
          CHUNKS OF ROAD into the sky! SCREAMING over the SOUND:



           Somebody shoot something!

          Cougar HEFTS HIS RIFLE. Setting up shop in the back.
          Sighting the choppers through his scope. Jensen, excited,
          and a little delirious from blood loss:


           I think Cougar's got a plan! Coug,
           do you have a plan?
           
           He's got a plan!


           
           Stop yelling at the sniper!
          THROUGH THE SCOPE -- Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the
          chopper on the left... Smiles, PRESSES THE TRIGGER...

          And we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters.

          The bullet strikes the tail rotor DEAD CENTER -- it SHORTS
          and spins off -- sending the chopper itself into a spin --
          COLLIDING with it's TWIN CHOPPER on the right -- they
          both twist and hink up -- their ROTORS SLICING INTO EACH
          OTHER -- both FINALLY CAREENING ONTO THE FREEWAY BEHIND

          Our guys. Driving away from the carnage of two exploding
          Cobra Helicopters splattered across the road...

          Safe.


          Coming in for LANDING...



          As it taxis towards a HANGAR. Max straightens his suit.
          Wade on the phone, frowning. Bad news. He flips the
          phone shut. To Max:


           They got away.


           So?




           
           We know exactly where they're going,
           Wade. Port of New York, for their
           big final awesome stand against
           the forces of evil where they die.

          He claps Wade and the shoulder and heads down the steps...



          ...where the TWO INDIAN SCIENTISTS wait. The Indian THUG
          CREW has been beefed-up to about TEN BIZARRE LOOKING,



           Do you have the money?


           Jesus, always with the money! So
           impersonal! How are you? How
           have you been?


           I recently attended the funeral of
           my best friend who you had thrown
           out a window. How have you been?


           Can't complain. I'm thinking of
           getting satellite radio in my car...


           I think you're a freak. Too much
           Ronald McDonald. Too much fantasy
           football.

          Max smiles and spreads his arms...


           Hey, I'm all about the bombs, baby.


           We have your ordinance. You have
           twenty four hours to get the money.

          Max looks over to Wade.


           Time to go make a withdrawal...


          As he turns back to the plane...


           New change of plan. You stay.


           I've got to go get your money.


           He'll get your money. You stay
           right here.

          A PAUSE as Max contemplates this little twist.


           God, are you short.

           Twenty three hours, fifty nine
           minutes...

          Max looks at Wade.


           Get it done.

          Wade heads for the jet. Max watches him go. As Wade
          boards the jet Max takes a big sigh. For the first time,
          looks like a guy who might not be quite as sure of things
          as he would like. Max Looks back to the Short Scientist.


           How much do you weigh? Seriously.


           I do not think you are funny.


           Where the hell is my bomb?

          The Short Scientist points to a large flatbed pick-up. A
          HEAVY TARPED BOMB LIKE PACKAGE strapped to the back.


           You do not get it till I get the
           money.


           For a guy who's all about
           transcending materialism, you talk
           about money so much!



           If you keep talking, Pop-Amm will
           cut your mouth out of your face.


           Fine...



          After business hours. A WINDOW SMASHES. Roque climbs
          inside. Goes to the front and unlocks it for the others,
          who carry a BLEEDING JENSEN in. They lay him on a table.


           She burned us, Clay.


           I know...


           The whole op is compromised-


           I know.


           Hey, fallen comrade here! Blood
           flowing out of his body...

           Precious, precious blood...



           Cougar?
          Cougar nods. Gathers gauze, needle, thread, and a WOODEN
          DOWEL. Comes over as Jensen looks at the last one.


           What's that for?

          Cougar SHOVES IT BETWEEN JENSEN'S TEETH as an answer...


           So we split up again. Right?

          Clay doesn't respond...


           Right?



           Pooch...



           Goddammit, Clay, whatever she knows,
           Max knows! It's over!

          His words echo through the room.

          JENSEN SCREAMS through the dowel as Cougar sews him up...

          This is how low they've sunk. Clay finally looks up.



           Okay. We split up. Some of us
           should go international. I'll do
           that if nobody else wants to-


           So we just run again?

          Clay turns to him.


           There's nothing else we can do...

          Silence. Then:


           There's something we can do.

          A beat.

           Excuse me?


           Three years is enough. If there's
           a drive at that port that we can
           use to get clear-


           What part of "he knows we're coming
           for it" do you not get? They're
           gonna be waiting for us. Par-Sec
           is gonna waiting for us...



           So figure out a way around them;
           you're good at that shit, Clay!

          He turns, addressing all of them:


           We run now, we're gonna be running
           forever. This is our one chance
           to get our lives back...

           To steal them back. And I'm
           prepared to do anything to any one
           to make that happen.

          He looks Clay dead in the eye.

           Never play a longshot, you're never
           gonna win.

          A long beat. Clay, not breaking his look with Roque:


           Pooch, what's the minimum time to
           scout the patrols, get an accurate
           head count on-site at the Port?


           48 hours, but Aisha knows that-


           So we hit them in twelve.

          Roque smiles. Pooch blinks.

           Twelve hours from now? You mean--
           you want us to go in blind?


           Last thing they'll expect...


           Yeah, cause it's dumb.


           Jensen's already got the layout,
           and Cougar can spot on site. Right?

          Cougar nods. He's in.



           Jensen?


           Yeah, cause gettin' shot is
           awesome, I'm totally up for doing
           it again...

          He gives a weak thumbs-up. In. All that's left is


           Pooch?

          Pooch, struggling with the decision...


           Last time we went in blind on an
           op, we lost everything...


           So?

          A beat. Pooch looks up.


           So let's go get it back.





          ESTABLISHING. The harbor is enormous. A small TWIN
          HURRICANE BOAT cuts through the morning waves. Half mile
          from the Goliath docks. At the controls, Clay and Roque.


          GOLIATH EMPLOYEES going about their business, preparing
          for a tanker docking. All seems normal until we look a
          bit closer: FOUR-MAN Par Sec security patrols. Bomb
          sniffing DOGS. Two Cobra ATTACK CHOPPERS.


           You ready?

          A GOLIATH TANKER approaches from behind. Roque looks
          back at the tanker. Not answering - he seems to have
          something on his mind.


           Roque?



           I'm ready.

          Clay drops the twin throttles and spins the speed boat
          towards the APPROACHING TANKER. Several TUGS and SECURITY
          LAUNCHES are maneuvering around it...



          Clay and Roque approach one of the launches from behind.
          Climbing aboard. They take the two SECURITY MEN from
          behind with TASERS, then strip off their outer gear,
          revealing PAR-SEC UNIFORMS.



           We're in. Status.



          A block off the front gate. A blacked out Chevy van.
          Pooch sits behind the wheel. Ready for exfiltration.


           The Pooch is good.


           Cougar, squelch if you're in
           position.



          A drainage pipe with a thick security cage covering it.
          We PUSH IN HARD, reveal a small opening cut in the cage
          it -- THROUGH the opening -- FIRE 70 FEET into the pipe --
          through a second opening -- down another long pipe and

          SLAM UP HARD ON COUGAR. Crouched BELOW the terminal.
          Looking up through a grilled man hole at Par-sec Guards.


           Squelch.



          Clay and Roque dock their Launch and hop out. Blending
          in perfectly with the Par-Sec Guards.


           Jensen, we're coming. You ready?




          A huge shipping room with hundreds of crates. We push in
          on a LARGE WOODEN CRATE. The side of the crate STARTS TO
          FLEX... and SPLINTERS as Jensen breaks out of his box!


           And the crowd goes wild...



          Clay and Roque approach. Knock. From the inside, Jensen
          leaning up against the door.


           What's the password?

           Open the door before we kill you.

          Jensen opens the door. Clay and Roque quickly move in.


           Drive should be in the Computer
           Room, two skylights over.


           Roque and I will set the charges
           here but we won't detonate until
           you have the drive.


           You can't settle for stealing the
           drive, you gotta blow up Goliath's
           shit too.

           What can I say, I hold a grudge.

           Get gone.

          Jensen nods. Knows how important his job is. Heading
          for a ladder. Clay and Roque begin to set CHARGES
          throughout the room...


           Be ready to move the second Cougar
           hits the fire alarm...




          Cougar avoiding security. SCALING A LARGE OIL TANK, taking
          up a sniper position on top of it...



          Jensen hopping rooftop to rooftop...



          Cougar in full sniper fire position. His sights dead on:
          A MASTER FIRE ALARM -- 300 yards down. His RADIO CRACKLES:


           Guys, we got a problem...


          Pooch in the van, seeing through BINOCULARS...


           Wade's here.

          And he is. Being given a TOUR by PAR-SEC GUARDS...




           Are you kidding me?


           No. I say we roll.


          Jensen, by a MIRRORED SKYLIGHT (so you can't see down
          into the room). Attaching a HARNESS to his waist...


           I'm above the computer room, maybe
           thirty seconds from the drive...



          Clay, listening through the radio:


           Wade's headed your way - last chance
           to get the duck out of Fodge...



           Something's not right. Something...




           Clay.


           What?

          Roque, standing in front of a HUGE CARGO CONTAINER.


           I think you should see this.
          Roque's got the doors of the container opened that he's
          looking in. Clay approaches...



          Jensen, finally ready to hit the computer room, GENUFLECTS
          once for luck...



          Clay and Roque staring...


           You think... Aisha?

          THE CONTAINER -- Top to bottom, completely loaded with
          fresh minted stack BUNDLES OF CASH. More physical money
          than we have ever seen. By a lot. Ever. Then:

           No. Not Aisha.

          Clay turns to him as -- WHAM! -- a CROWBAR SMASHES DOWN
          on his head! Roque, gripping it, looking down at Clay...


           You know, for a revenge driven
           conspiracy nut, you're pretty
           fucking gullible...



          Jensen, leaping through the SKYLIGHT... SMASHING DOWN
          through the GLASS...




          ...And landing in an EMPTY ROOM.

          No computers. No stand-alone drives. No nothing. Except
          for PAR-SEC GUARDS with weapons trained at his head...



          Pooch sitting in the van, into the radio:


           Jensen, you get it? Jensen?

          Does not see the FIVE PAR-SEC SOLDIERS moving in on his
          car, long guns up and out...


          Cougar flexed and aimed. Scope locked in on the fire
          alarm... CLICK! Safety off on a gun pressed to his
          temple. Fuck. He LAYS DOWN THE GUN and puts his hands
          behind his head. Furious at himself for GETTING CAUGHT...



          From the shadows, WADE ENTERS. Clay looks up at him.


           Hello, Clay. Been awhile.

           Roque.

          Head wounds bleed bad. The crowbar caused a mother of a
          gusher on Clay. He wipes blood from his eyes. Manages:

           When...?


           After the truck. I got tired of
           waiting for you to save us, so I
           up and saved myself. Reached out
           like I said and cut a deal - I set
           this up, I go free.

          He begins walking around Clay as he talks.


           Traitor...



           You gave me no choice. It was
           always gonna end like this, Clay.
           Us captured or dead. It was always
           a dead end. You made sure of it.



           Bullshit...


           Not bullshit. You were gonna keep
           planning missions and ways to hit
           Max until it got us all killed.


           No...


           Yes, Clay. Yes. Only difference
           with this situation is at least I
           get to walk away.


           We all could have walked... used
           the drive...


           Don't you get it yet? There is no
           drive. There never was...

          Wade BEGINS LAUGHING. Clay looks like he's been slapped.


           Fennel made it up to save himself.
           When I told Wade, he planted the
           info at Goliath to lead you here.

          Clay stares at him.


           You really thought there was a
           happy ending coming? Pooch was
           gonna get his family back, we were
           gonna get to be soldiers again?
           
           We lost the moment we went off
           mission. This is just the logical
           conclusion of that playing out.
           You didn't want to hear it.




           You just wanted your revenge.
           Your face-to-face with the big bad
           wolf. I'm sorry, buddy, but it's
           the way of the world...

          Roque straightens back up, shaking his head:


           Guys like us don't beat guys like
           him.

          In the corner, Wade nods at this. Behind him, A LARGE
          SEMI pulls up to the CASH CONTAINER. Over the following,
          a hydraulic lift hoists the cash container onto the truck:

           Kill me now... Maybe you live
           through this.


           Oh, we're not gonna kill you.
           Someone's gotta get away with the
           cash. Your crew? I'm definitely
           wasting them. But you?

          He nods to the HYDRO-WINCH slowly lowering the CASH
          CONTAINER onto the flat bed, with a smile...


           You're about to steal a billion
           dollars from the Central
           Intelligence Agency.

          Clay stares at daggers at both of them.

           It's for our replacement nuke.
           When a billion goes missing, people
           tend to ask who took it.

           Max really does love to frame you...

          Several Par-Sec Guards arrive. Wade points to Clay:


           Take him away. Drop him in Newark.

           I'll see you at Turner Airfield.


          The Guards handcuff Clay and drag him to his feet. Pushing
          him towards the door. As he hustled past Roque:


           Wait.

          They stop. Roque looks at his old friend.


           I'm sorry it had to end this way.

          Clay stares back at him.


           You're going to die very badly.
          The guards hustle Clay out the door...



          PAR-SEC GUARDS lead the Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar towards
          the far end of the terminal. Each, bound. Cougar looks
          up to see a separate set of Guards leading CLAY the
          opposite way. Their eyes connect - both knowing:

          They've lost.


           
           Roque.

          Cougar lowers his head, sadly. Clay's pushed into A TRUCK.

          Gone.
          The Guards take Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar BEHIND A
          WAREHOUSE. Looking at each other. Knowing, this is the
          end of the line. The Lead Guard RACKS HIS MACHINE GUN.


           On your knees.

          Pooch SPITS AT HIM. The Lead Guard calmly SHOOTS HIM in


          Pooch SCREAMS. Falls. The Par-Sec boys force Cougar and
          Jensen down too, CLUBBING THEM with their rifles. Pooch
          looks up at his assailant. Gasps through the pain:


           Get on with it...


          The Lead Guard smiles. Looks to Cougar, who's shredding
          his skin to the bone trying to claw out of the cuffs...


           That's a nice hat.

          He steps forward to take it, but Cougar is too quick for
          the man, MOVING HIS HEAD AWAY. He reaches for Cougar
          again. Again, Cougar evades. The guards laugh at their
          colleague, who continues trying to grab Cougar's hat.

          The Lead Guard has had enough of Cougar's antics.
          Levelling the rifle at his head...


           Don't really care of there's a
           hole in it. One wash, good as...

           What are you smiling at?

          Cougar's nods past him...

          As the Guards turn to see ON TOP OF AN OIL TANK...



          As she rises up to standing, A SLANT-K 600 ROCKET HIP
          BLASTER locked and loaded. Looking like an Old Testament
          style Goddess of Vengeance and Destruction. A moment of
          FROZEN SHOCK on the rest of Wade's Hit Crew...

          And she pulls the trigger. A HIGH PITCHED WHISTLE as

          THE ROCKET STREAKS across the Terminal! Headed straight
          for an ENORMOUS FUEL TANK...
          KA-BOOM! The explosion ROCKS THE ENTIRE TERMINAL...



          The Truck Clay is prisoner in is BLOWN INTO THE AIR by
          the SHOCKWAVE... SMASHING down onto it's side, skidding...



          Cougar and Jensen DESTROY the remaining Par-Secs with
          legs. Grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves.


           Shouldn't have gone after the hat...


          WHAM! Cougar kicks the Guard in the face, knocking him
          cold. Aisha rappels off the Oil Tower in the distance.
          VARIOUS PAR-SEC TEAMS fire at her! Cougar scoops up two
          rifles and tosses one to Jensen - they give her covering
          fire as she comes! As he shoots, to the wounded Pooch:


           Can you stand?


           I've been shot in both legs, what
           kind of dumbass question is that?


           Oh, so we're Mr. Grumpy now? You're
           not the only one who's been shot
           recently, you know!

          He empties a full clip into a Par-Sec team and reloads...

          AISHA -- Pinned down forty yards away. Almost out of
          AMMO. Par-Sec Team, almost on top of her when

          A FIGURE emerges from an OVERTURNED TRUCK. GUN in each
          hand, BLAZING. The Par-Secs cut down one by one. The
          figure lowers his guns. Desert Eagles. Walks up to her.
          Underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it's

          CLAY. They stare at each other...

          Then, incredibly, Aisha RAISES HER WEAPON AT HIM.


           Did you kill my father?
          Jensen comes running up, interrupting:


           Clay?


           Kind of in the middle of something
           here, Jensen-


           Did you kill him?


           There was no drive, Clay-



           



           There was no drive and Roque's
           gone and Par-Sec's regrouping and
           Pooch could bleed out-

          Aisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back:


           Did you kill him?

          Clay, about to respond when:

           I did.

          They turn to see our LONG TALL SNIPER standing above them.


           He asked us. It was mercy. But
           you're his family, so I understand.

          And then, incredibly, Cougar lays his rifle at her feet.




           But only me.

          Clay and Jensen blink, shocked. Aisha stares at Cougar,
          equally surprised. She levels her pistol AT HIS HEAD...
          Silence. We CUT WIDE to see...

          A GUNSHOT. Muzzle flash from Aisha's gun. COUGAR FALLS...

          In close again. Aisha stands over Cougar's body.

          The others, stunned... And then Cougar rises. Face
          BLOODY. Cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased
          his flesh. She FIRES AGAIN - BLAM!

          Identical scar on his other cheek. Blood runs down his
          face. He doesn't move to wipe it away.


           Wear it. Remember him.


          Cougar nods. Leans down, picks up his rifle. Debt paid.


           Okay, excellent, very tribal--We
           need to go.

          As if on cue, BULLETS kick up DUST around them! A new
          Par-Sec team, incoming. Clay, Jensen, Aisha, and Cougar
          hightail it back to where Pooch lies.


           Can you stand?


           This is stupid question day, isn't
           it? It's stupid question day and
           someone forgot to tell me...

          Clay slings Pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style.
          Looks across the Terminal to where Pooch's van is parked.
          PUSH IN on Clay's face for:


           Let's go.

          And they do. Sprinting across the open space IN SLO-MO,
          Cougar and Aisha WASTING EVERYTHING THAT MOVES. A full
          on ballet of fully automatic mayhem...

          They make it to the van! Piling in! Cougar behind the
          wheel GUNS THE ENGINE and they PEEL OUT...



          Pulling on to the HIGHWAY. Silence sets in. The high of
          the firefight, over. Just pain and loss now.

          Five people, some terribly wounded, with nowhere to go.
          Just the rocking of the van as it heads down the road.




           They won. We lost. Way it goes.

          Silence.


           Way it always goes.

          Clay looks at him.



           Guess we should just head home.
           Oh, wait, that's right. We don't
           have homes.

          Clay doesn't respond. Aisha studies him. Nods. Knows
          what has to be done. They all do. From behind the wheel:


           Where to, Colonel?

          Clay looks up at the use of rank...



          Wade pulls up in a Corvette. Gets out and walks over as
          Roque finishes supervising Par-Sec guards finish loading
          the CASH onto a HUGE TRANSPORT PLANE.


           Your friends jack-rabbitted. Should
           we be worried?


           Clay doesn't take risks. It's why
           I'm here and he's not.


           You're sure?

          Roque nods.


           Can I ask you something? Why'd
           you stick with those losers for so
           long?

          Roque considers. Then:


           They were good guys.

          Wade half smiles at this. Shaking his head.


           No such thing. I'll go call Max.

          He begins walking towards HANGAR...

          CRACK! As the FENCE by the AIRSTRIP is SMASHED INWARDS
          by the Van! Headed straight for him! Clay, WAVING:



           Hi, Wade!



          Roque turns to the Pilot:


           Declan, start the plane...



          WADE raises his UZI and FIRES - Taking out the Van's front
          tires! THE VAN Flips! Smashing end over end, finally
          coming to a rest on it's side! Climbing out, groaning:

           Next time, remind me - car crash
           first, then get shot...


           Sounds less painful that way...

          Clay looks across the tarmac to see the plane begin to
          Taxi. ROQUE stands in they back - loading ramp still
          down. FLIPS CLAY A SALUTE...


           Cougar and I are going after that
           plane. The rest of you, get Wade.


           Me and legless Pooch are on it!

           Where the hell is she going?
          Aisha is heading off to the fenceline... Clay and Cougar
          run for Wade's CORVETTE. Cougar slides behind the wheel
          and starts her up, PEELING OUT after the plane...


           You call me legless Pooch again,
           you're gonna be Headless Jensen.


           What, it's a cool name! It makes
           you sound like a pirate!
           
           Fine, let's go kill Wade...




          Cougar guns the engine, catching up to the TAXIING
          TRANSPORT PLANE. Clay leans out the window, shooting at



          Huddled in the plane's CARGO HOLD, RETURNING FIRE. The
          PILOT, yelling to him.


           We don't have enough runway to
           take off - we're going to have to
           turn around and come back to get
           up to speed!


           Fine, just get us in the air!
          He fires ANOTHER BURST from his weapon at the Vette!
          CLICK - his WEAPON DRY.


           I'm out!

          IN THE CORVETTE -- SIMULTANEOUSLY, Clay, WEAPON DRY.


           I'm out.

          He stares through the windshield to look at Roque.


           Get me closer...


          Jensen enters, carrying a MACHINE GUN.


           Yoo-hoo! Wade!
           
           Come out and plaaaayyy-

          The ROAR of an engine -- Jensen DIVES out of the way as
          Wade WHIPS PAST on a MOTORCYCLE! Heading for the runway!



           Hey, Wade's coming at you! I...

          He trails off. Looking at THE LEAR JET that Wade arrived
          in. Sitting in the Hangar's Corner. Keys the radio...



           I think I just found our way out
           of here...



          The Corvette, pulling behind the still lowered REAR RAMP
          of the TRANSPORT PLANE! Clay, onto the CORVETTE'S HOOD...

          Roque, rising to meet him. Waiting for him...

          Clay JUMPS! Landing on the ramp!

          IN THE CARGO HOLD - Roque smiles. Pulls a WICKED LOOKING
          KNIFE. The two men stand there. Sizing one another up...

           Gotta admit, I always wondered how
           this would play out.


           Aisha thinks you kill me.


           It's a distinct possibility...

          They begin circling one another. Clay, still weaponless.


           You don't have a knife?


           Don't need one.


           Bit of as longshot for you...



           No. It's not.

          Roque LUNGES AT HIM...

          But Clay does have a knife. He PULLS IT and SLAMS IT
          into Roque's belly! Roque, stunned! Staggers back...

          For most men, that would be the end of the fight. But
          not these two. Roque gives Clay a bloody grin.



           Now I really am gonna cut your
           head off...

          He LUNGES AGAIN! And now it is FULLY ON...

          The blades whip up and down - almost too fast to see
          Roque gets Clay with a left cross, then buries his knife
          in Clay's shoulder. Clay twists free, slashes at Roque.

          Ten seconds in, the men separate again. Breathing hard...

          Clay sees Roque doesn't have his knife. Looks - realizing
          it's still embedded in his own shoulder. Pulls it out,
          TOSSES IT BACK TO ROQUE. They stand there, both panting...
          Then RUN AT EACH OTHER full tilt!

          Here's how it ends. And pay attention, IT HAPPENS FAST:

          Clay goes low -- coming up to grab Roque's knife hand,
          which is arcing DOWNWARDS TOWARDS CLAY'S THROAT -- Clay
          manages to HALT THE HAND, blade inches from his Adam's
          apple -- and there's a moment where Roque could overpower
          him and actually cut his head off... But Clay THROWS HIS
          WEIGHT FORWARD and BREAKS ROQUE'S RIGHT ARM!

          And for the first time, Roque SCREAMS.

          Which seems to make Clay happy.

          So he BREAKS ROQUE'S LEFT ARM too.

          Roque falls to his knees, BROKEN, BLOODY, AND BEATEN...
          TO REVEAL -- The PILOT. Leaning out of the cockpit, DESERT
          EAGLE levelled at Clay.




          The Pilot PULLS THE TRIGGER. The bullet slams into Clay's
          abdomen and BLOWS HIM off his feet backwards -- FLYING
          OUT OF THE PLANE -- And landing on hood of



          Clay SMASHES DOWN ON the windshield -- Cougar pumps the
          brakes and spins the wheel -- desperately trying to keep
          Clay from rolling off the hood...




          TURNING AROUND at the end of the runway. Beginning it's
          final run to get up to speed...



          Now driving TOWARDS IT on a chicken-like collision course
          when WHOOSH! WADE FLIES PAST ON HIS MOTORCYCLE! Clay
          turns to Cougar through the spiderwebbed windshield:


           Rifle...

          Cougar passes Clay his SNIPER RIFLE and FLOORS IT...


          AT ONE END OF THE RUNWAY, the plane starting to take off.

          AT THE OPPOSITE END, Wade's motorcycle heading full speed
          at the approaching plane. Cougar and Clay, chasing Wade.

          And then AISHA steps out INTO THE MIDDLE of the runway.
          The ROCKET LAUNCHER clutched in her hands.

          She takes a knee. Aims at the plane, which is almost at
          lift speed. ROQUE sees her from the cockpit.

          She locks eyes with him and GRINS -- FIRING into the
          LANDING GEAR of the plane AS...



          PULLS EVEN WITH WADE. Instead of shooting, Clay THROWS
          Cougar's RIFLE BETWEEN THE SPOKES of Wade's FRONT TIRE,
          causing the bike to

          CATAPULT WADE OFF and FORWARD...

          ...THROUGH THE AIR and into the RIGHT NUMBER TWO JET ENGINE
          of the now flying cargo plane. The ENGINE EXPLODES.

          Aisha, somehow safe on the ground, looking up at the
          escaping plane. Clay looking up. All of them watching...

          ...as Roque dies very badly.

          WHOOMP! The big plane EXPLODES in a MONSTER FIREBALL--VA
          DOOOM! Burning gas and iron and cash. FIRE RULES.




          Our guys. Bloody, eyes bitterly triumphant. Clay stares
          at the sight before him. Only one word for it.


           Outstanding.

          Jensen approaches, supporting Pooch.


           Not to rain on everyone's we killed
           all the bad guys parade, but we
           should probably get gone - legless
           Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up
           for us in the Hangar.
           
           It's a cool name-

          From the smashed up bike Wade was driving, WADE'S CELL
          PHONE RINGS. Clay gets off the hood of the Vette and
          Cougar and Aisha help him hobble over. Answering it:


           Hello?



          MAX and the INDIANS. INTERCUT with Clay:


           We good?

          TIGHT ON CLAY realizing who he's talking to.

           Not by a longshot. You're not
           having a real great day, Max.


           Who is this?


           Just a voice on the phone.


           Where's Wade?


           Working on the engines.


          A beat as it hits Max.


           Clay.


           It's Colonel.

          In the distance, SIRENS.


           Colonel, yes. Well done.


           Thank you.

           I understand you've always wanted
           to meet face to face. I'm sure
           that could be arranged...

          A beat. Then:


           I don't think the guys you're about
           to stiff for a billion dollars are
           going to allow that to happen.
           
           We win. You lose. Goodbye.

          He snaps the phone shut and tosses it into the fire.
          Turns to the others.


           Lear jet?


           Ready when you are.

          Pooch, Jensen, and Cougar start for the Hangar. Clay
          looks to Aisha. A moment between them.


           I wanted to find and punish those
           responsible for my father's death.
           Max, his men, everyone.


           That why you slept with me?



           That and the cardio.

          Clay smiles.


           You coming?

          A beat. She nods.


           I'm coming.


           Good cause there's no way I could
           walk it...
          She helps him up and we begin to PULL UP AND BACK as they
          head for the Hangar. Together.



          Max lowers the phone. Looking stunned. The Short
          Scientist has run out of patience.


           Time is up, Stretch.

          Max looks at the Short Scientist.


           Stretch. That's a good one.

          But he doesn't look like he's very amused.

           Because you are so much taller
           than I.


           Yeah, no, I get it...

          Momentary pause. The Short Scientist looks at Max. Slowly
          gets up, LEAVES MAX alone in the room with the ten Indians.
          Max takes a deep breath, looks up at the DEATH SQUAD.


           You gentlemen consider yourselves
           to be soldiers or businessmen?






          We think it's the end. But then we hear

          WIND. Blowing through trees. Crickets. The soft sound
          of evening television. Somewhere suburban...





          A nice quiet neighborhood. Outside the kitchen window
          Pooch's wife JOLENE, doing dishes in the sink again.

          A RUSTLING. Jolene looks up this time. She obviously
          heard it. She puts down the dishes and goes to the door.
          Opens it and looks out to see...

          Nothing. Not even by the swingset.

          She sighs. About to head back inside when she spies

          A GLINT OF LIGHT. By the oak tree in the front. She
          steps outside. Walks down until she sees what it is.
          Her breath hitches in her chest.

          A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree.

          And now there are tears in Jolene's eyes. Because she
          knows what it means.

          Her husband is alive. And he will make it home.

          Someday.
