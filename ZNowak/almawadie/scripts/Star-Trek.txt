                                                            November, 2007






15   OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a 15
     WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until
     finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we...





     The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY,
     just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm
     water runs down its face and body.

     TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE  who holds and cleans the
     baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind
     her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the
     baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:


                He is strong.

     The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out
     to the new MOTHER:

     AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a
     divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly
     takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized.
     She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:


                ... hello.

     CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room.
     She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:


                The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?


                        
                She is human.

     A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking
     into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time,
     that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.


                Sarek arrives.

     The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for
     a moment, clearly disquieted.








      A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities
      constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the
      mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the
      horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built
      seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.



      The speeder parks outside the home --



      SAREK  comes out to the balcony through the
      rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He
      looks at the child -- his child -- and says:


                 Well done.

      She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just
      enough rancor:


                 Thanks.

      He regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE --


                 Your tone suggests disappointment. The
                 Science Council required my presence for
                 a session regarding--


                 Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you
                 here.

      The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.
      The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a
      small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,
      clinically:


                 As you are aware, the Vulcan male is
                 traditionally not present at the moment
                 of delivery.


                 Well traditionally, I'm not the one
                 giving birth.
                         





                   I moved here -- to another planet -- to
                   be with you. I needed you to be with me
                   today. Holding my hand and telling me
                   I'm doing great, even when I'm just...
                   breathing the best I can.

      Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at
      the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers
      this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:


                   You are correct. I should have been
                   here. I am sorry.

      And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses
      him. And the two look at the baby.


                   I had a thought. That we might name the
                   child after one of our respected early
                   society-builders. His name was "Spock".

      She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.


                   Your silence does not suggest enormous
                   enthusiasm.


                   No... Spock.
                           (smiles, touches his
                            face)
                   ... Spock.

      She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.


                   The child has your eyes.

      She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She
      gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,
      revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.


                   ... and your ears.

      And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,
      we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM
      SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS
      -- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS
      OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:






      With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and




      -- our sensors haven't made        -- no sir, it looked like a
      sense of the anomaly?              lightning storm in the middle
      -- how far are we from the         of space --
      Klingon Neutral Zone?              -- 150,000 kilometers, but the
                                         vessel is not Klingon, Sir,
                                         its registry doesn't match any
                                         recorded profile --

      SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a
      flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on
      the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks:


                 Report.

      -- turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face,
      swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:


                 Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four.


      Are they transmitting on any       Negative, Captain -- all
      frequency?                         communications appear to be
                                         shut down.


      Hail the ship. What's the          Nothing even close, Sir.
      closest match on registry?

      Robau moves to Pitts:


                 Any response?


                 No Sir -- hails met with silence.


                 Maybe they're incapable -- any
                 identifiable damage?


                 Negative, Sir -- but our readings seem
                 confused--





                   Confused?


                   -- not only is the ship unregistered --
                   but even its construction materials seem
                   unrecognizable.

      Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they
      approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA --
      ENORMOUS AND THREATENING. He doesn't even realize that he says:


                   ... oh my God...
                           
                   A lightning storm... then this...
                           
                   Signal all departments: first contact
                   protocols. Looks like we have someone
                   new on the block. All Stop.











      And in the endless vacuum of space, and in TOTAL SILENCE, the
      Kelvin appears as a dot, coming to a stop in front of the
      gigantic BLACK CLAW that is the Narada --



      Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:


                   Sir, should we initiate an invasive scan?


                   That could be seen as an act of
                   provocation -- all readings passive--

      Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --



      Sir, I have a reading --
      they've locked weapons on us!     -- Red alert!   Arm weapons!

      ALARMS BLARE -- LIGHTS GO RED as --






      The Narada FIRES a TORPEDO -- IT HEADS FOR THE KELVIN -- then
      SEPARATES, fracturing into a multi-hit projectile --



      Officers SCRAMBLE, brace for impact --



      Torpedo locked on us at 320
      degrees, mark two -- incoming      -- Evasive pattern Delta-5!
      fast!



      A direct hit SMASHES several decks along the DISH of the ship --



      In the massive Engine Room, a HUGE BLAST -- MEN GO FLYING IN THE




      Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor --
      then, on his chair com.:


                 Damage report!

      INTERCUT with:



      Moving with the Kelvin's CHIEF ENGINEER:


                 Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen
                 anything like it! Weapons off-line!
                 Main power at 38 percent!

      As the crew regains their footing, the First Officer pulls
      himself to his console, true fear in his eyes as he places an
      inter-ship call -- it's RINGING -- his fear grows with every
      passing RING -- then, we INTERCUT WITH:



      A WOMAN, 25, answers her communicator -- she lies on an exam
      table, afraid -- and pregnant. This is WINONA.





                   -- what was that-- what's happening?!

      But the First Officer is just relieved that she's still alive:


                   -- you're okay-- thank God-- where are
                   you?


                   Medical bay-- I had a few close
                   contractions-- I'm fine-- what was that?


                   Just sit tight-- stay there-- we'll be
                   fine--

      Or maybe not:


                   They're firing another, Captain!



      ANOTHER NARADA TORPEDO -- it SEPARATES, pieces HIT the Kelvin.



      Chief Engineer RUNS past us -- CONSUMED BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION!



      A FEMALE CREW MEMBER running down the hall suddenly HOLDS ON as
      a HOLE IS RIPPED IN THE HALL -- and she's YANKED OUT OF THE
      CORRIDOR -- the CAMERA finally getting sucked out too!









      -- life support failing on           -- this is the U.S.S. Kelvin,
      decks seven through thirteen!        attemping to reach Starfleet
      We have confirmed casualties,        command on subspace! Repeat --
      Sir!                                 U.S.S. Kelvin, under attack by
                                           unknown aggressor!


      -- shields at eleven percent         -- were our shields even up?
      and dropping! Ten percent --         That was like nothing I've
      we're at nine! Eight percent!        ever seen -- this ship can not
      Seven! We're dropping here!          take another hit like that!
      Six!


                   All remaining power to forward shields!
                   Prepare the shuttles f--

      And he STOPS. They all do. A fucking FACE is now on their
      VIEWSCREEN. A ROMULAN FACE -- the FIRST OFFICER of the Narada,
      whom we'll come to know as AYEL:


                   My commander requests the presence of
                   your captain in order to negotiate a
                   cease-fire. You will come aboard our
                   ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal
                   would be unwise.

      Screen goes DEAD. All eyes on Robau... and he feels them.      A
      tense, horrible moment. Finally, to the First Officer:


                   Walk with me.

      The First Officer follows Robau OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO:



      As they walk, briskly:


                   If I don't report within fifteen minutes,
                   execute general order 13.


                   Sir, we could issue a mayday call to--


                           
                   There is no help for us out here. If
                   we're going down, we're taking them with
                   us -- you save as many as you can.





                   ... aye, Captain.

      Robau heads into a waiting TURBOLIFT, turns -- they lock eyes,
      knowing what this means. Finally:


                   You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk.

      He's gone.   And we realize this is GEORGE KIRK, Jim's father.








      All eyes on Kirk as he enters -- moves to the captain's chair.
      Sits. Not a small moment. Speaking his first words as Captain:


                 Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau's vital
                 signs to the main view screen.


                 Yessir.

      In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors --
      his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW-
      PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD --


                 Vitals on line.


                         
                 -- thank you.



      TILT DOWN as the TURBO-LIFT DESCENDS -- we PUSH IN as the doors
      open and Captain Robau gets out -- moves quickly -- hurries down
      a SHUTTLE BAY catwalk --



      Robau enters a shuttle -- LIGHTS BLINK to life.   He moves to the
      cockpit -- starts the vehicle up --


                 Computer, initiate departure sequence.

      A LOUD HISS and the craft SHUDDERS as it disembarks --



      Sparks dripping from the ceiling, everyone is motionless -- eyes
      on the monitors -- and we're TIGHT ON GEORGE KIRK -- the BEEPS
      of Robau's heart might as well be representing his own. He
      realizes he's sweating -- wipes his forehead as:


                 The shuttle's pulling out of main bay,
                 Sir.


                 I want to see him -- floodlights please.






      Two MASSIVE FLOODLIGHTS on the Kelvin's dish GO HOT -- and turn,
      FLARING out the lens -- landing on the SHUTTLE as it leaves the
      KELVIN, heading toward the imposing Narada.



      Backlit by the distant floodlights, Robau remains steely-eyed as
      he moves for the darkened ship -- nerves --



      And Robau's HEARTBEAT QUICKENS -- the tension they all feel:


                 His heart rate's elevated--


                 He's scared.


                 He's brave.    That's what he is.



      Robau watches as he gets closer, the BEEPBEEPING HEARD over the
      SOUNDS of the shuttle -- but then --



      ALL WE HEAR IS THE LOW-PITCHED BEEPBEEP as the small shuttle
      seems to get swallowed up by the massive forward-facing spires
      of the Narada -- the distant floodlights creating EERIE SHADOWS
      everywhere. A gigantic IRIS DOOR TURNS, SLOWLY OPENS -- and the
      shuttle enters the Narada's main HANGAR -- the door CLOSES --



      And everyone is just motionless and silent. Only Robau's VITAL
      SIGNS can be HEARD, BEEPING away. George's eyes glued ahead --



      TIGHT ON ROBAU as he faces the shuttle door, considering his
      fate. Finally the SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS -- standing there are
      eight ROMULAN GUARDS, brandishing WEAPONS. He steps down. They
      grab him, hard -- he's SCANNED -- FRISKED -- PULLED ALONG -- and
      we REVEAL the absolutely MASSIVE HANGAR, the insane architecture
      of the interior of this dark, wet, dripping ship --






      Robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. A dozen Romulans
      at controls. Robau does his level best to portray confidence as
      he is led up a walkway to AYEL. Behind him, sitting silhouetted
      and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. A
      presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.

      Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before
      Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we
      will refer to it as the JELLYFISH).


                 Are you familiar with this craft?

      Robau regards it.   Then:


                 Who is your commander?
                         
                 Is it him?


                 You will speak only to me.


                 Then ask your commander what right he has
                 to attack a Federation vessel.


                 That was hardly an attack. My commander
                 will easily destroy your ship. If you do
                 not respond to the question.

      Robau considers the hologram again.     And what his answer might
      mean for the fate of his crew.


                 I've never seen it. Or any ship like it.


                 Are you familiar with -- or better, know
                 the location of -- Ambassador Spock?

      Ayel has thrown another HOLOGRAM -- A FLOATING, ROTATING IMAGE
      OF SPOCK, who appears to be 75 earth-years old. The baby, born
      just three years earlier. Robau is as confused as we are...


                 I am unfamiliar with Ambassador Spock.


                 A final question. What is the current
                 stardate?





                           
                   ... Stardate? ... it's 2233.04.
                           
                   ... hey, where are you from--?

      Suddenly: TSCHING! Nero's activated his STAFF -- FOUR LARGE,





      BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... Robau's vitals go dead.      PUSH IN ON
      KIRK as a SCREAMING ALARM IS HEARD --


      They're launching again!           Evasive! Evasive! Delta-Five
                                         maneuver! Fire full-spread!





      The Kelvin BANKS as it FIRES WILDLY -- another TORPEDO BLASTING
      FROM THE NARADA -- it SEPARATES -- some miss, OTHERS HIT!



      Debris FLIES TROUGH THE CEILING, SLAMMING INTO A BRIDGE SUPPORT
      BEAM! Green COOLANT SPEWS from under the floor grating --


                   I'm initiating General Order 13! Set
                   self-destruct for maximum matter-
                   antimatter yield! Two minute countdown!


                   Yessir!


                   I want auto-pilot targeted for their fuel
                   cells!


                   Sir, unable to locate the ship's power
                   source!


                   Then just target the damn thing dead
                   center!


                   We got bigger problems: the first hit
                   destroyed auto-pilot!





                   The only way we're gonna ram that ship is
                   to fly manual control!

      TIGHT ON GEORGE as this lands.      More honorable than terrified:


                   -- then I'll do it myself -- get to the
                   shuttles, now!
                           


      Agony in the faces as they reluctantly hurry off -- Kirk takes
      the Captain's chair, hits the COMLINK:


                   All decks, this is the Captain speaking --
                   evacuate the ship immediately, get to
                   your designated shuttle crafts --



      MOVE FAST around Winona, in fucking labor now -- being
      transferred onto a wheelchair by the Doctor and Nurse--


      -- repeat: evacuate ship and
      get to designated shuttles           -- that's George's voice --
      NOW!                                 what's happening?


                   We're packing it up -- you'll deliver in
                   the shuttle!

      -- and she's on the move, out the door as her COMMUNICATOR
      SOUNDS -- she answers --


                   -- George!



      Alone now on the bridge, piloting this massive craft by himself -
      - George talks to Winona from the Captain's chair --


                   I have medical shuttle 37 standing by,
                   get to it now -- can you do that?


                   Yes -- where are you?

      HOLD ON GEORGE for a moment as he hesitates -- his eyes glued to
      the screens as he pilots --





                   I'm on my way.


                   Good-- and George, it's coming-- our
                   baby, it's coming now.

      PUSH IN on him, his heart shattering -- having to out-maneuver
      incoming torpedoes, piloting the ship to its doom -- still, he
      forces optimism:


                   I'll see you in a minute, sweetheart.

      He disconnects -- another ALARM -- he TURNS the ship, FIRES --



      The Kelvin BANKS AGAIN -- its PHOTONS SLAMMING INTO THE ONCOMING




      CREW MEMBERS scramble to their shuttles as the ship TREMBLES --
      and we find WINONA among them, being PUSHED through the madness.



      The Med-Team ARRIVES with Winona in the wheelchair-- it's CHAOS -
      - and for Winona, a huge contraction --


                   -- Agh!   That was-- that was a big one!

      -- as they put her into the shuttle bed:


                   Just keep breathing, Honey, you're gonna
                   be just fine--


                           
                   -- the baby, too, right?


                   -- the baby too.



      As George Kirk pilots, he checks the monitors -- one reads the

      SECONDS...) and another reads IMPACT PROXIMITY (36,054 METERS,





      Another screen that shows stats of DEPARTING SHUTTLES -- more
      leaving as we glance at the screen -- but SHUTTLE 34 REMAINS


      The NARADA is GROWING in the viewscreen -- he hits the comlink:


                   Captain to shuttle 37 -- is my wife on
                   board?







      The PILOT is readying the controls --


                   Yessir, she is--


                   I need you to go now, d'you hear me?


                   We're waiting for you, Sir--


                   No-- go, take off, immediately.


                   ... yessir!

      Shuttle Pilot works the controls -- and Winona, in the back,
      feels the shuttle SHUDDER --


                   Wait! We can't go, my husband isn't here
                   yet! Please! STOP--!

      -- but she's suddenly WINCING as another CONTRACTION hits --


                   You'll need to push now-- are you ready?



      Clamps holding the shuttle SLAM BACK, the MED-SHUTTLE DROPS
      HARD, FUSION IMPULSE ENGINES IGNITE and the shuttle MOVES --








      George hits COMLINK -- a TONE -- then WINONA'S VOICE:


                 The shuttle's leaving-- where are you?

      As George EVADES ENEMY FIRE, heading for the massive alien ship:


                 My love?   Listen carefully, okay?





      Winona, holding her communicator --


                 -- we're about to have this baby --


                 Sweetheart... I'm not going to be able to
                 be there.

      And she just stares -- realizing what's happening -- that he's
      been made Captain -- that there was an evacuation -- and somehow
      she just KNOWS. Tears come to her eyes --


                 -- no-- no, no-- wait--


      I want you to hear me.
      Please.                           Are you still on the ship? No-
      -- There's no other way-- my      - no, you need to be here--
      love-- you know all I want--      -- George, I can't do this
      all I want in the world is to     without you--
      be with you--                        
                                        -- please -- don't d--!

      -- but she's WINCING AGAIN --


                 Okay-- you need to push.

      -- and she does -- the shuttle BANKS and --



      -- and the shuttle LEAVES the Kelvin bay -- turning to join
      DOZENS of other shuttles, all heading off in escape --






      As George PILOTS, DODGING INCOMING -- we INTERCUT WITH:



      Winona PUSHING -- giving birth to their baby -- and we're BACK
      AND FORTH between a husband and wife that will never see each
      other again, MUSIC SWELLING as the Kelvin TURNS HARD, avoiding
      TORPEDOES -- the shuttle BANKING as the Doctor and Nurse help
      Winona -- and we're ON GEORGE as he HEARS A BABY CRYING -- and
      TEARS COME TO HIS EYES -- as he says--


                 Hey!   Hey, so what is it?


                 -- it's a boy.


                 It's a boy?   Yeah?

      And now we see Winona, handed this beautiful little boy.   And
      she cries, just looking at him --


                 Tell me... tell me about him-- please--


                 He's-- he's beautiful, he looks like you.

      Heartsick, George laughs -- glances at the MONITORS -- SELF-
      DESTRUCT COUNTDOWN IS AT T-MINUS 20 SECONDS -- oh God...


                 George, you should be here --


                 I know-- so what should we call him, huh?


                 We could name him after your father.


                 Tiberius? Are you kidding me? No,
                 that's the worst-- we'll name him after
                 your dad-- let's call him Jim.


                 ... Jim.   Jim it is.

      Through the VIEWSCREEN -- he's ABOUT TO HIT -- the ship ANGLES
      within the enormous Narada blades -- George scared now --





      Sweetheart? Sweetheart? I
      love you. Can you hear me?          -- yes-- yes, I hear you...
      -- I love you. I love y--

      -- his VOICE CUT OFF as --





      -- the Kelvin SLAMS INTO THE NARADA -- an EXPLOSION BEGINS and--



      George's voice goes STATIC -- confusion washes over her face --
      suddenly LIT BY A BRIGHT GLOW -- she looks over, with wet
      devastated eyes --

      -- what she sees is the MASSIVE EXPLOSION -- quickly SUCKED AWAY
      in the vacuum of space -- and she's CRYING -- holding her new
      baby who just lost a father -- his life altered forever...





      The shuttle SAILS AWAY with the others... HOLD ON THIS... for a
      long beat. Then PAN OVER to see NERO'S SHIP TUMBLING SILENTLY
      THROUGH SPACE -- DEBRIS still raining from the explosion --



      MAYHEM: ALARMS and CREW work to stabilize the ship (OVERLAPPING
      ROMULAN DIALOG TO BE WRITTEN) -- we arrive at Nero, who, with
      small specks of HUMAN BLOOD on his face, just STARES at the
      fucking HOLOGRAM OF SPOCK -- he's OBSESSED.

      Ayel works a monitor, yelling out something  to one
      of their men -- and as a result:



      Gargantuan "BLADES" EXTEND from the ship like otherworldly SAILS
      -- and the ship begins to STEADY -- but then ANOTHER SHIP
      APPEARS -- DECLOAKING FROM NOTHINGNESS: a fucking KLINGON VESSEL
      -- then ANOTHER -- AND ANOTHER --



      And we're on Ayel as he witnesses, on his monitor, ships,
      popping up ALL AROUND THEM -- which is when they HEAR a VOICE --
      speaking KLINGON -- and we SUBTITLE:





                  Trespassing vessel: you have entered the
                  jurisdiction of the Klingon Empire.
                  Power down and prepare to be boarded or
                  you will be destroyed.

     Eyes wide, Ayel turns to Nero, still staring at Spock's image:


                          
                  Commander Nero -- we're surrounded.

     Finally Nero looks up.


                          
                  Sir-- what are your orders?

     And we PUSH IN ON NERO as our MUSIC BUILDS, then we CUT TO:





     CLOSE ON a young VULCAN BOY. 11 years old. SPOCK. He's
     standing in an abstract space -- IMAGES PROJECTED and HOVERING --
     questions -- that he's answering as they appear, then disappear:


     What is the square root of
     2,396,304?                          -- one-thousand-five-hundered-
                                         forty-eight --
     -- Correct. What is the
     central assumption of Quantum       -- everything that can happen
     Cosmology?                          does happen, in equal and
                                         parallel universes --
     -- Correct. Identify the 20th
     century earth composers of the
     following musical progression:      -- Paul McCartney and John
                                         Lennon.
     -- Correct

     And we find ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD -- then ANOTHER -- all in these
     odd spaces -- until we PULL BACK WIDE to reveal a large Vulcan
     LEARNING CENTER -- white "bowls", sunk into the dark ground,
     where PROFESSORS walk, hands behind their backs, surveying this
     mass "mental martial arts" test.

     We're on ANOTHER VULCAN CHILD as she gets an answer wrong -- AND
     THE LIGHT OVER HER BOWL GOES OUT. Then ANOTHER CHILD -- who
     gets an answer wrong -- and HIS LIGHT GOES OUT. An EXTREMELY
     WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT reveals BOWL AFTER BOWL as the LIGHTS GO OUT.




     Until only one bowl remains. Spock's. He finishes his last
     question. Gets it right. PUSH IN ON HIM as the COMPUTER SAYS:


                  Your score is one-hundred percent.
                  Congratulations. Spock.

     Off his face, we CUT TO MOMENTS LATER, as Spock collects his
     things. As he does, three young VULCAN BULLIES walk up behind
     him. Spock glances at them, then back to his things.


                  I presume you've prepared new insults for
                  today.


                  Your mother lies with many men.

     Spock just NODS.   Tries to ignore the fact that IT STINGS.


                  I have no such information.


                  You are neither human, nor Vulcan -- and
                  therefore, have no place in the universe.


                          
                  This is your thirty-fifth attempt to
                  elicit an emotional response from me.
                  Logic dictates you would cease by now.


                  Look. He has human eyes. They look sad,
                  don't they?


                  Perhaps an emotional response requires
                  physical stimuli.

     And Bully #2 PUSHES Spock -- who stumbles back, almost falling
     into one of the bowls. He looks up as:


                  He's a traitor, you know. Your father.
                  For marrying her.

     Spock stares -- we see him fighting the urge, but he's unable --
     AND HE CHARGES THE BULLY AND TACKLES HIM INTO THE BOWL! They
     land inside -- Spock cries, flailing as he punches Bully #2!
     The other two stand atop the bowl, stunned -- shocked -- unsure
     what the hell to do -- and we CUT TO:






     TIGHT ON Spock, chastened, sitting glumly on a bench. A massive
     VULCAN CITY seen through the window behind him. His parents
     ARGUE at a distance down the hall:


     -- where I'm from, when
     someone hits you, you hit back-
     - how is that not logical?         -- Spock had no reasonable
     -- They pick on him -- they        expectation of being
     tease him -- every day.            physically injured --
                                        -- Which is precisely when
                                        reason must guide his actions
     -- I want him to embrace           above all.
     Vulcan, you know that... but
     he has to be himself-- which
     means, occasionally, being         -- His "humanity" is very the
     human.                             source of his ostracism.
     -- When Vulcans get disgusted
     with each other, they never
     just walk away, do they?           -- No.
     -- Well humans do.

     And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns --
     sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING
     IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in
     front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:


                I did not mean to create conflict between
                you and mother.

     After a beat, Sarek seems to soften a little.     No anger in his
     face. Takes a seat beside his son...


                In marriage... conflict is...


                ... constant?


                Natural.
                        
                Emotions run deep within our race. In
                many ways, more deeply than in humans.
                Long ago, they nearly destroyed us...
                that is why we followed the teachings of
                Surak. Now you must choose.


                ... between you and mother?





                  Never, my son. But you may choose the
                  ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity
                  humans seldom experience. The control of
                  feelings... so that they do not control
                  you.


                  They called you a traitor.
                          
                  You suggest that I should be completely
                  Vulcan... and yet you married a human...
                  why?

     Sarek is clearly conflicted by this.      But he holds steady:


                  As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to
                  observe and understand human behavior.
                  Marrying your mother... was logical.
                          
                  Spock. You are fully capable of choosing
                  your own destiny. The question you are
                  faced with... is which path you will
                  take. This is something only you can
                  decide.



     BAM -- a door opens: 14 year-old GEORGE KIRK, JR. angrily exits
     the house, carrying a duffel. His angrier, redneckier UNCLE
     FRANK following. 11 year-old JIM KIRK nervously pursues them:


                  Go ahead: go-- run away! You know I
                  could give a damn!


                  -- wait-- no!    Where are you going?


                  Anywhere but here, far as I can get!


                  Which won't be far enough -- know what
                  your problem is?!
                          
                  No one ever taught you respect! How to
                  follow orders! Do as you're told!
                          
                  -- what the hell are you doing?


                  I-- I just don't want my brother to go.





                   Well I do-- and I asked you to wash the
                   car! How many damn times do I need to
                   repeat myself?! How many damn times?
                   How many?

      A glare to George and Frank walks off. Jim nervously follows
      his brother, pulling out a small, FLOATING DISC --


                   Please stay-- you can have my Flo-Yo!

      George hits it away:


                   This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank.
                   I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no
                   idea what he's like when she's not here--
                   d'you hear him talking like he's our
                   dad?! And that's not even his car you're
                   washing! That was Dad's car! You know
                   why you're washing it? Because he's
                   gonna sell it!


                   Don't leave -- okay? We can tell Mom
                   when she gets back from Africa.


                   She's gone for five more months, by then
                   I'll be in a different system.
                           
                   You're gonna be okay. You always are.
                   Always doing everything right -- good
                   grades and obeying every stupid order...
                           
                   I can't be a Kirk in this house. Show me
                   how to do that and I'll stay.

      But Jim can offer nothing. George gives him a quick hug and
      walks off. Jim sadly watches his brother go.



      Kirk washes a VINTAGE CORVETTE. Red, white top. Dumping the
      sponge in bucket, he's sadly cleaning, his mind spinning over
      his brother's departure. Devastated.

      And he's wiping the soapy passenger window  with
      the sponge, when he STOPS -- seeing the KEYS in the ignition.
      PUSH IN ON HIS FACE as a devilish idea comes to his mind. PRE-
      LAP A LOUD SCREECH and we CUT TO:









      young Jim Kirk behind the wheel (NOTE: The SOUND of the engine
      is a metallic WHIR -- not a gas engine). TIGHT ON JIM'S FACE as
      he drives -- having never done this before, he's as nervous as
      he is determined --



      The CORVETTE SPEEDS -- while inside the car, Jim turns on the
      updated, modified RADIO -- scans stations, momentarily losing
      control of the car -- but he's back on track as he finds a HARD
      ROCK SONG -- and HE'S STARTING TO FUCKING LOVE IT -- PILOTING


      He reaches for a CONVERTIBLE ROOF latch -- then the other -- but
      with the speed he's driving, THE ROOF RIPS RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING
      CAR -- Jim glances back, wide-eyed -- and the roof TUMBLES
      through the air, landing on the road -- and we PUSH AND ARC
      AROUND, as a POLICE OFFICER runs out from taking a roadside PISS
      -- he races back, jumps on his HOVERCRUISER and TAKES OFF --


      BACK IN THE CORVETTE -- BLOOPBLOOP!!! -- Jim's eyes dart to the
      REARVIEW as the cruiser WEAVES behind him -- then PULLS UP
      BESIDE HIM -- the COP sees a CHILD driving and is AMAZED -- he
      calls through his PA:


                 Son, you pull over that car!

      But Jim just BLASTS the RADIO LOUDER:






      George, bag over shoulder, thumb out. He turns at the SOUND of
      the SIREN -- sees what's approaching... that car... looks...
      familiar... and the THE CORVETTE SHOOTS PAST HIM, JIM AT THE
      WHEEL -- then the POLICE HOVERCRUISER! George runs into the
      middle of the road, mouth agape --


                 -- no... way.

      Back at the Corvette, Jim YANKS the steering wheel TOWARD THE
      COP -- who RISES to avoid the Corvette, which SCREECHES onto a
      perpendicular DIRT ROAD, kicking up wild dust as the Cop ARCS
      QUICKLY to follow --




     Jim is now officially LOVING THIS -- and he DRIVES THROUGH a
     FENCE -- CRASH! The Cop RACES through it, in the Corvette's
     DUST -- and we PUSH IN on a SIGN that reads "DANGER - QUARRY
     AHEAD -- IOWA MINING CO." In fact --



     We see the MASSIVE QUARRY -- hundreds of feet deep -- and TILT
     UP to the Corvette and Cop speeding toward it --



     KIRK, EYES INTENSE, ALMOST SUICIDAL -- this is where he's been
     headed all along -- and for a moment we think holy shit -- this
     is how James Kirk dies. He speeds toward the edge -- CLOSER --
     CLOSER -- but at the last second, Kirk SLAMS the brake -- the
     car SKIDS -- PIVOTS -- and he LEAPS FROM THE CAR, WHICH SAILS
     SIDEWAYS OFF THE CLIFF EDGE -- FALLING... falling... the COP
     comes to QUICK a STOP in CLOUDS of DUST as the Corvette EXPLODES


     The angry Cop hops off his hovercruiser, hand on weapon, as Jim
     Kirk, out of breath, exhilarated, gets to his knees.


                  What's your name, son?

     And as he stands, we PUSH IN on him -- LOW and WIDE -- damn if
     that kid doesn't have a swagger. It's like the first time he's
     ever stood in his life.


                  My name's Kirk. James Tiberius Kirk.

     And as our MUSIC BUILDS we CUT TO:



     CONSTANT SHOCKS OF LIGHT as an ALIEN PRISONER -- intelligent, bi-
     pedal, but with FOUR TERRIFIED EYES -- is SLAMMED DOWN onto the
     wet pavement -- a CHOKE STICK SHOVED under his chin -- then:
     VOICES. Brutal, guttural KLINGON --



                  You say they are not yours...

     WHIP PAN TO SEE the scary KLINGON GUARDS -- four of them --
     standing above the Alien -- chilling MASKS hide their hideous
     faces -- and one holds a FLUORESCENT SET OF PAGES --


                  ... these Federation maps we found in
                  your pockets.




      And the ALIEN SPEAKS -- an UNKNOWN LANGUAGE -- all eyes wild:



                   I speak the truth. I do.


                   Then who are they for?

      But the Alien just SHAKES HIS HEAD, afraid -- he will not talk.
      So they GRAB HIM AND YANK HIM UPWARD --


                   You would rather die then tell us?

      PUSH IN TIGHT as the Alien finally WHISPERS, terrified:




      And the Guards look at each other... seemingly with concern...

      MOMENTS LATER EIGHT GUARDS WALK TOGETHER -- and we PAN WITH THEM
      to reveal the HORRIFYING EXPANSE THAT IS THE KLINGON PRISON
      YARD. We realize that the constant shocks of light was
      LIGHTNING, that apparently never stops here. A SUPER READS:
      "RURA PENTHE - KLINGON PRISON ASTEROID". And we see they're
      heading for a MUSCULAR FIGURE, using a SLEDGE HAMMER, SPLITTING
      ROCKS, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. BOOM UP to
      find that it's NERO. And he stops, SENSING the coming Guards.
      And he manages a small smile. And he QUICKLY TURNS to them --
      THEY ALL STOP, SUDDENLY. Afraid of him. One of them tosses
      Nero a set of MANACLES. Nero picks them up. Puts them on. And
      offers his cuffed hands, willingly.



      Guards drag Nero through the massive pyramidal structure...



      Nero's ARMS AND LEGS get STRAPPED IN TIGHT. Go WIDE to reveal
      he's pinned to an interrogation table -- three GUARDS. A
      KLINGON INTERROGATOR approaches; looms over Nero, studying the
      Romulan's face with clinical detachment...



                   I have come far to meet you. "The One
                   Who Does Not Speak." Ten years is a long
                   time to maintain silence.
                           
                   Perhaps you simply do not speak Klingon,
                   just as I do not speak Romulan.





                           
                   But I assume we both speak the language
                   of our common enemy.


      UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.) He reveals a worn LEATHER JOURNAL.
      Opens it, flips through it almost casually... we see SKETCHES of
      the JELLYFISH SHIP, PAGES OF COMPLICATED MATH EQUATIONS...


                   We found this book in your cell.
                   Cartography, mathematics-- what do these
                   mean? This date here -- eleven years
                   from now-- what happens then?
                           (holds up the

                   And why attempt to smuggle in maps of
                   Federation space?

      Nero's face betrays nothing; no fear, no doubt. Cold as fucking
      ice.   The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book:
      A DRAWING OF SPOCK. He closes the book.


                   When you were captured we assumed you
                   were a spy, sent from Romulus to surveil
                   the Empire. But because the Romulans
                   deny your existence, I believe you are
                   much more than that.

      Interrogator looks over to the Guards, nods. A Guard approaches
      with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER; we HEAR something wet FLIP-
      FLOPPING around inside, but we can't SEE what it is.


                   Your ship remains in orbit above us now.
                   We've been asking for its secrets for too
                   long. That is why I am here. We want to
                   know how it works and I believe now,
                   finally... you will tell us.

      A Guard uses TONGS to pull out the most DISGUSTING creature
      you've seen from the container: a SLUG with SUCKERS and spikes,
      covered in a grimy muck -- it FLIP FLOPS.


                   Centaurian slugs. Their native planet is
                   in constant sunlight. As a result,
                   there's nothing they hate more... than
                   darkness.

      A Guard GRABS NERO'S HEAD and FORCES IT BACK; the second PRIES
      HIS MOUTH OPEN with his hands.




      Another Guard SHOVES THE THING INTO NERO'S MOUTH -- Nero keeps
      his eyes open -- furiously determined not to be broken -- as
      they FORCE HIM TO SWALLOW IT -- he DOESN'T SCREAM as the
      wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his
      stomach --


                 They try to claw and bite their way out
                 of any dark space they're in.

      Nero stares at the ceiling in HORRIFYING INTERNAL PAIN -- but
      straining to block it out. PUSH DOWN on Nero's wide, crazed
      eyes -- TIGHTER as we SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO SEE WHAT HE'S SEEING --









      Quiet. A waiting area. AMANDA, Spock's mother, stands alone in
      a passageway. She looks off-camera to her son:


                 Spock, come here, let me see you.


                          
                 No.


                 Spock.

      Reluctantly, Spock walks into frame. She begins adjusting his
      collar. This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying
      like hell to look impassive.


                 There is no need to be so anxious.
                 You'll do fine.


                 I am hardly "anxious", mother.
                         
                 And "fine" has variable definitions.
                 "Fine" is unacceptable.

      She just smiles as she works his collar. He sees this and    it
      annoys him. He tries to move her hands away, to stop with    his
      collar -- his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet-- but   he
      doesn't let go of her hands. A meaningful silence between    them.





                  May I ask a personal query?


                  ... anything.


                  Should I choose to complete the Vulcan
                  discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all
                  emotion... I trust you will not feel it
                  reflects judgement upon you.

     She stares at him, moved.      Touches his face.


                  As always... whoever you choose to be...
                  you will have a proud mother.

     HOLD on mother and son, worlds apart but forever bonded:



     An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before
     the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER,
     seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS.


                  You have surpassed the expectations of
                  your instructors. Your final record is
                  flawless. With one exception. I see you
                  have applied to Starfleet as well.


                  It was logical to cultivate multiple
                  options.


                  Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby
                  accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy.
                  A distinction all the more significant
                  given that you will be its first half-
                  human pupil. It is truly remarkable,
                  Spock. That you have achieved so much
                  despite your disadvantage. Welcome to
                  the Academy.

     They all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled:


                  If you would clarify, Minister-- what
                  "disadvantage" are you referring to?


                  ... your human mother.




     As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same
     look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his
     father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat.
     His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes
     the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --


                  Council -- ministers.    I must decline.

     Everyone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold:


                  No Vulcan has ever declined admission to
                  this academy.


                  Then as I am half-human, your record
                  remains untarnished.


     Spock. You have made a
     commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can
     way--                                think of no greater way to
                                          honor our race than to attend
                                          Starfleet as its first Vulcan.


                  Why did you come before this council
                  today? Was it to satisfy your emotional
                  need to rebel?


                  I came with the intention of enrolling,
                  as my father wished. However, your
                  "insight" has convinced me otherwise.
                  Therefore, the only emotion I wish to
                  convey is gratitude. Thank you,
                  Ministers, for your consideration.
                          
                  Live long and prosper.

     He looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident --
     still, God bless him, Spock walks out --



     -- PUSH DOWN A HALLWAY -- MUSIC HEARD -- what seems like a PARTY
     is going on through windows in the double-doors ahead -- and a
     WOMAN SWOOPS INTO VIEW in front of us -- we PUSH BEHIND HER in
     the short skirt and high boots as she ENTERS the place -- a
     local, busy BAR -- the woman makes her way to the BAR, and we
     see her GORGEOUS, DIGNIFIED FACE. THIS IS UHURA. She leans
     into the bartender warmly, her smile glorious:





                  Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two
                  Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth
                  beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft.


                  That's a lot of drinks for one woman.
                  Wearing those boots.

     JAMES KIRK'S FACE leans in: at 22, he's charming, witty,
     dangerous, rebellious. He grins at her, flirty. Uhura gives
     him a look, then back to the bartender:


                  And a shot of Jack, straight up.


                          
                  Make it two -- her shot's on me.


                  Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks.


                  Don't you want my name before you
                  completely reject me?


                  I'm good without it.

     Damn, he likes her already.


                  You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim
                  Kirk.
                          
                  If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna
                  have to make one up.


                           
                  Uhura.


                  Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was
                  gonna make up for you. Uhura what?


                  Just Uhura.


                  They don't have last names in your world?





                Uhura is my last name.


                They don't have first names in your
                world? Wait, let me guess. Is it "Jim"?

     That makes her smile.    So he moves closer to her:


                Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying.
                What's your focus?


                Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't
                know what that means.


                Let me guess: study of Alien languages:
                phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means
                you've got a talented tongue.


                And for a moment I thought you were just
                a dumb hick who only has sex with farm
                animals.


                Well.    Not only.


                You think you're smart.


                Oh, baby, I'm the smartest.

     Something sad in that.    A BURLY STARFLEET CADET appears.


                This guy bothering you?


                Beyond belief, but nothing I can't
                handle.


                You could handle me.    That's an
                invitation.

     The Burly Cadet spins Kirk around:


                Hey.    You mind your manners.





                At ease, Cup Cake, it was a joke.     Like
                your hairline.

     Uhura turns back.    The other cadets, seeing trouble, approach.


                Hey -- Jim: enough.


                What was that?


                You heard me, Moon Beam.


                You know how to count farm boy?    There's
                five of us... and one of you.


                Okay, so go get some more guys, come back
                and it'll be an even fight.

     The cadet swings his fist but Kirk HEADBUTTS HIS HAND, BREAKING
     IT -- another Cadet PUNCHES KIRK, then THROWS HIM into a table,
     which Kirk FLIES OVER, landing hard -- another Cadet GRABS HIM,
     pulls him up -- Kirk SLAMS FIVE FAST PUNCHES that send the Cadet
     back -- when ANOTHER CADET PUNCHES HIM -- yet another HOLDS KIRK
     -- and that last punch is repeated THREE-- then FOUR times --


                Enough!    STOP!

     Another punch and Kirk FLIES TO THE FLOOR - he's out of it, but
     won't give up. The Cadets UNLEASH on him and really PUMMEL HIM -
     - and Kirk's spirited, but LOSING -- about to LOSE BAD -- when
     an EAR-SPLITTING WHISTLE makes everything STOP -- they turn --
     standing in the doorway is a tall, rugged Starfleet officer --



                Outside, all of you!       NOW!

     The cadets file out, in for it. Pike moves to a dazed, semi-
     conscious Kirk, now upside down on a table.


                Y'alright, Son?


                You can... whistle really loud, y'know
                that?

     -- and Kirk PASSES OUT.








     HIGH WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT of the almost-closed bar. Only Kirk and
     Pike sit here at a table. Kirk's bloodied, tissue in his nose.


                I couldn't believe when the bartender
                told me who you are.


                ... and who am I, Captain Pike?


                Your father's son.
                        
                For my dissertation, I was assigned the
                U.S.S. Kelvin. Something I admired about
                your dad... he didn't believe in no-win
                scenarios.


                He sure learned his lesson.


                Depends on how you define winning.
                You're here, aren't you?
                        
                That instinct to leap without looking--
                that was his nature, too. And in my
                opinion it's something Starfleet has
                lost. We're admirable, respectable. But
                overly-disciplined.
                        
                Those cadets you took on, they'll make
                competent officers -- but you can bet
                your ass they'll run home to momma the
                minute they're looking down the barrel of
                a Klingon phaser cannon.


                -- why are you talking to me?


                I looked up your file while you were
                drooling on the floor. Your aptitude
                tests were off the charts-- what is it,
                d'you like being the only Genius Level
                repeat-offender in the midwest?


                Maybe I love it.





                  So your daddy dies... you can settle for
                  a less-than-ordinary life.
                          
                  Or do you feel like you're meant for
                  something better? Something special?

     And that just hangs there for a beat. Because Pike just hit a
     nerve. Kirk does his best not to show it -- still absent-
     mindedly fiddling with STARFLEET SHIP SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS.


                  Come to think of it, I do want to feel
                  special. You know what? I'm gonna go
                  start a book club--


                  Enlist in Starfleet.


                  Enlist. You must be way down on your
                  recruiting quota for the month--


                  If you're half the man your father was,
                  Jim, Starfleet could use you. You could
                  be an officer in four years, have your
                  own ship in eight.

     He's getting under Kirk's skin -- but Kirk keeps up the 'tude,
     grabs his jacket, stands --


                  We're even, right?   I can go.


                  Riverside shipyard. Shuttle for new
                  recruits leaves tomorrow, 0800.
                          (Kirk turns, Pike grabs
                           him)
                  Your father was Captain of a Starship.
                  For twelve minutes. I dare you to do
                  better.

     Eyes lock... and it's now Pike who stands and walks off.   And
     that's where it hangs. Off Kirk, brooding...



     CORN STALKS whipping by -- Kirk on his SPOKELESS MOTORCYCLE
     rocketing across the plains -- his soul's been stirred and he's
     fighting it -- he cranks it, ELECTRIC ENGINE SCREAMING --






     Kirk pulls up to us, kills the bike. Camera starts to MOVE
     AROUND HIM -- he's dramatically BACKLIT and we COME AROUND for
     an INCREDIBLE REVEAL of a SHIPYARD -- at its center, the
     skeletal frame of a NEW SHIP under arclights. UNMISTAKABLY, THE
     U.S.S. ENTERPRISE. Unformed, raw, like its future captain. Our
     MUSIC SWELLS, we PUSH IN ON HIM, considering Pike's offer, his
     future, his fate.



     The shipyard is abuzz with activity -- cadets loading into a
     shuttle -- and Pike, staring off, waiting. The PILOT
     approaches:


                Waiting for something, Cap?


                ... No.   Guess not.

     He climbs in. The pilot rapidly flips through switches, running
     a pre-flight sequence. Pike straps in. Glances through the
     viewshield... SEES SOMETHING... and he smiles. From his POV:
     KIRK on his MOTORCYCLE, driving into the shipyard --


                Hold her a second...

     Kirk rides past a WATERFALL of cooling tanks -- stops the bike
     near the shuttle -- steps off, has nothing -- no bags -- just
     the clothes on his back.


                Nice ride, man.

     Kirk kicks the stand, tosses the guy the startcard --


                Live it up.

     Kirk walks past the startled worker and approaches Pike.


                Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three.

     Pike grins as Kirk passes him.

     Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some
     of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK
     UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND.





                  At ease, Gentlemen.
                          
                  Never did get that first name.


                          
                  And you never will.

     He smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle.   Straps
     in as it RISES...


                  Are you people deaf? I told you I don't
                  need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR!

     Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a
     FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks
     like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall:


     -- you need to find a seat --     -- I had one, in the bathroom,
                                       Darlin', with no windows --
     -- Sir, for your own safety,      -- I suffer from Aviaphobia,
     siddown, or I will MAKE you       case you don't understand big
     sit down... do you hear me?       words, it means 'fear of dying
     RIGHT NOW.                        in something that flies.'

     They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat
     beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his
     armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk:


                  I might throw up on you.


                  I think these things're pretty safe--


                  Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack
                  in the hull and our blood boils in
                  thirteen seconds -- solar flare might
                  crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell,
                  some of the damn passengers are blue.
                  And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a
                  case of Andorian shingles, see if you're
                  still so relaxed when your eyeballs are
                  bleeding-- space is disease and danger,
                  wrapped in darkness and silence.


                  I hate to break this to you, but
                  Starfleet operates in space.





                 Yeah, well my ex-wife took the whole damn
                 planet in the divorce, I got nowhere to
                 go but up. Leonard McCoy.


                 Jim Kirk-- you really gonna throw up--?


                 Maybe--

      As the TREK THEME SOARS, the shuttle ascends and we...











      Nero lies on the floor of his cell, semi-conscious, looking like
      death. Behind him the DOOR OPENS. Two KLINGON GUARDS enter,
      backlit.


                 The day you've been waiting for is upon
                 us, Silent One. And look. No sign of
                 salvation. No sign of change. Just more
                 pain.

      And they both lift his limp body up -- as something miraculous
      happens -- NERO SNAPS TO LIFE AND SINGLE-HANDEDLY BEATS THE SHIT
      OUT OF THE GUARDS -- TAKING THEM BOTH DOWN IN TEN SECONDS -- in
      what seems like an instant, he's the only one standing here --
      holding both of the Guards' rifles -- which he TWIRLS, badass.



      PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as it opens -- Ayel, chained, looks up,
      intensely -- and sees that it's NERO who has arrived -- we PUSH
      IN TIGHT ON HIM as he SPEAKS FOR THE FIRST TIME:


                 The wait is over.

      Off Ayel, we CUT TO:






      TILT DOWN from a GLIMMERING BUILDING TO REVEAL a sea of RED
      CADET UNIFORMS: HUNDREDS OF CADETS head across campus, McCoy and
      Kirk among them. A miraculous view of San Francisco beneath a
      blue sky, Golden Gate Bridge piercing the air. Kirk struts:


                 So you'll do it for me, right?


                 I have no interest.


                 I didn't ask if you have interest, I
                 asked if you'd do it.


                 I'm about to ask you an obvious question:
                 why bother?


                 Because I've failed the test twice.


                 And you're determined to make it three.
                 We've all failed it-- everyone has, and
                 that's the point! No one goes back for
                 seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not
                 like you need to pass it to graduate.


                 So Bones: why do they make us take it?


                 I told you to stop calling me that.
                 You're very annoying.


                 And you're the greatest -- thank you.


                 You'd better study for it this time.


                 Oh, no-- Bones -- I gotta date.





                   A date? Listen, as smart as you are,
                   which ain't much, if you don't prepare--


                   You have no idea how prepared I'm gonna
                   be-- no idea.

      And with a smile, Kirk heads off -- McCoy watches him go,
      calling after him:


                   Seriously, stop calling me Bones!
                           
                   "Bones".





      In MOONLIGHT, a beautiful WOMAN lies on her back, in some kind
      of bra, moaning in delight -- this is GAILA --


                   -- oh Jim... Jim... Jim, I love you.


                           
                   ... Yeah. I sent you a message.

      Gaila reaches over, turns on the light and we realize: SHE'S
      GREEN. And not particularly happy:


                   I say "I love you", and you say "I sent
                   you a message?"


      -- but you can only open it
      tomorrow at three o'clock on
      the dot --                        -- what are you talking about?
                                        What is it? What does it say?
      -- Gaila, promise me you're
      not going to open it 'till        -- what is it?    Tell me what
      three --                          it says!

      -- I'll erase it, I swear, if
      you don't promise me you'll       -- All right!!    Three o'clock!
      wait --                           I prom--

      They're INTERRUPTED by a DOOR OPENING -- GASP!





                          
                  You can't get caught in this dorm-- hide!
                  Under the bed, quick!

     Kirk falls, lands hard on the floor, SCRAMBLES under the bed as
     Gaila's roommate enters -- UHURA. Dropping her backpack:


                  Hey-- I thought you were going to be in
                  the long-range sensor lab all night.


                  I was supposed to be, but it was crazy, I
                  picked up an emergency transmission from
                  a Klingon prison planet -- there was an
                  escape and a ship stolen from th--
                          
                  ... you okay?


                  Yeah, been running simulations all week,
                  just catching up on some rest. Tired.
                          
                  That's all.

     Uhura watches her.   Her eyes narrow.


                  Were you running simulations with the
                  mouth-breather hiding under the bed?

     Gaila freezes, caught.   Uhura looks down, Kirk PEERS OUT.


                  Your hearing is scary-- you sure both
                  your parents are human?


                  The hell are you doing with him in here?


     I can't help it! I love him!      Gaila loves me--


                  Get outta here -- it's my ass too if
                  administration catches you in this dorm.


                          (getting dressed, to
                           Uhura)
                  You and I have a big day tomorrow --





                        
                You're gonna fail.


                If I pass, will you tell me your first
                name?


                No.   Good night.


                        
                I think the fact that you picked up a
                transmission of a Klingon prison escape
                is very interesting.

     SHE CLOSES THE DOOR ON HIM and we CUT TO:



     The Narada APPEARS through space --



     Dead silence on the bridge... all eyes on the VIEWSCREENS: empty
     starfield, roiling clouds of methane ice.


                We have arrived at the coordinates you
                requested. Stardate confirmed. 2258.5.

     Nero stands, looks out through his view screens.


                Standby.

     Ayel studies his console, hope in his eyes.     Quietly:


                Captain... long range scans of Beta
                Quadrant complete. Romulus is there.
                She's there. We could go. Right now, go
                home...


                Not yet -- not like this. Not how we
                left. This is our chance... to serve our
                people. We owe it to them -- to do what
                no other Romulan could ever do.




      Ayel hides his disappointment behind his eyes as suddenly -- A
      LIGHTNING STORM -- impossibly, from nowhere -- LOTS OF IT -- and
      through the lightning erupts THE JELLYFISH -- THE SHIP NERO HAS



                   Welcome back.    Spock.

      And we won't know where we are as MUSIC BUILDS and we CUT TO:



      Uhura TURNS TO US, at her comm station -- PUSH IN on her.     She
      seems wildly BORED and almost RESENTFUL:


                   -- we are receiving a distress signal
                   from the U.S.S. Kobayashi Maru. The ship
                   has lost power and is stranded.
                   Starfleet Command has ordered us to
                   rescue them.

      WHIP TO THE COMMAND CHAIR, where KIRK captains the battered
      bridge. Confident -- cocky:


                   "Starfleet Command has ordered us to
                   rescue them... Captain."

      She glares, turns away.      Then McCoy, at a console, reports:


                   Klingon vessels have entered the Neutral
                   Zone. And they are firing upon us.


                   That's okay.

      McCoy and Uhura -- and the others -- look at him, confused.


                   It's okay?


                   Yeah, don't worry about it.

      McCoy and Uhura share a look -- that's when we CUT TO:



      Looking at the bridge from above, we PULL BACK to reveal an
      observation room above the faux-ship. This is the test Kirk was
      referring to. CONSOLE TECHNICIANS monitor the proceedings. A
      TEST ADMINISTRATOR turns to another and asks:





                   Did he say "don't worry about it"?


                   -- what's he doing?

      And we CONTINUE TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL that, sitting among the
      technicians, is Gaila. Our resident GREEN GIRL. She checks her
      watch -- PUSH IN ON IT: 2:59 PM. On her MONITOR awaits a 23rd
      century e-mail -- a MESSAGE FROM KIRK --




                   Three more Klingon Warbirds decloaking --
                   and targeting our ship -- I don't suppose
                   this is a problem either?


                   Nah.


                   They're firing, Captain.


                   Alert medical bay to prepare to receive
                   all crew members from the damaged ship.


                   And how do you expect us to rescue them
                   when we're surrounded by Klingons?


                   Alert medical.

      Annoyed, she does as:


                   Our ship is being hit -- shields at sixty
                   percent.


                   I understand.


                   Should we at least, I dunno, fire back?


                   Mmmm... no.


                   Of course not.






      CLOSE ON GAILA'S WATCH as it changes to 3:00 -- and she   opens
      Jim's message -- and all it reads is, "I'M SORRY." And    just
      then something UPLOADS and EXECUTES and ALL THE SCREENS   IN HERE
      AND ON THE BRIDGE DIE -- THE SYSTEM CRASHES -- everyone   reacts --


                 -- the hell's happening?!



      The crew doesn't know what's up -- except Kirk, who is
      remarkably pleased -- when the LIGHTS AND MONITORS COME BACK ON,
      things are not the same:


                         (perplexed, works
                          controls)
                 -- the Kobayashi Maru is still in
                 distress... but... the Klingons have
                 stopped firing.


                 Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the
                 Klingon warbirds.


                 Jim, their shields are up.


                 Are they?

      McCoy looks at his monitor.   No they're not.


                 ... no.


                 Fire on all enemy ships -- one photon
                 each should do -- let's not waste
                 ammunition.


                 Target lock acquired on all warbirds --
                 firing!

      They fire -- AND DESTROY ALL FIVE KLINGON SHIPS INSTANTLY.    All
      mouths here are agape.





                   Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So.
                   We've eliminated all enemy ships, no one
                   on board was injured and the successful
                   rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is
                   underway.

      For the first time, Kirk looks up to the testing room windows:


                   Anything else?



      And they're stunned up here, too -- Test Administrator #2 turns
      to someone OFF-CAMERA:


                   How the hell'd that kid beat your test?

      REVEAL who he was talking to: SPOCK is here.      And not happy.


                   ... I do not know.





      TIGHT ON a stern STARFLEET ACADEMY PRESIDENT:


                   James T. Kirk.     Step forward.

      It's a huge Starfleet chamber. Golden Gate Bridge visible
      through huge windows. 500 cadets, a nervous KIRK among them.
      He stands, moves to one of two PODIUMS.


                   An incident has occurred today that
                   concerns the entire student body.
                   Academic immorality by one is an assault
                   on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet
                   Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this
                   council suggesting you violated the
                   ethical code of conduct pursuant to
                   regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code.
                   Is there anything you care to say before
                   we begin?


                           
                   Yessir. I believe I have the right to
                   face my accuser directly.




     President nods toward the assembly. SPOCK RISES. He and Kirk
     MEET EYES for the first time. It's clock-stopping.


                  Step forward please. This is Commander
                  Spock, one of our most distinguished
                  graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi
                  Maru test for the last four years.

     Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM.      President nods.


                  Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow
                  managed to install and activate a sub-
                  routine in the programming code, thereby
                  changing the conditions of the test.

     We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed.


                  Your point being?


                  In academic vernacular, you cheated.


                  Respectfully.    Define "cheating".


                  To deceive by trickery.


                  Now let me ask you something I think we
                  all know the answer to: the test is
                  rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to
                  be unwinnable.


                  Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of
                  the exam is relevant to these
                  proceedings.


                  Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test
                  itself is a cheat.


                  Your argument precludes the possibility
                  of a no-win scenario --


                  I don't believe in no-win scenarios --




     FIND PIKE amongst the officers in attendance. His eyes locked
     on Kirk. This is his boy. His recruit. And he's INVESTED.


                 Then not only have you violated the
                 rules, you've failed to understand the
                 principle lesson.


                 Please, enlighten me.


                 You, of all people should know, Cadet
                 Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.

     ON KIRK. The first punch by Spock that landed.      The cockiness
     slips away as he senses where this is going --


                 "I of all people?"


                 Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had
                 assumed command of his vessel before
                 killed in action, did he not?

     Shit.   The DADDY card.   Kirk, a mix of ANGER and EMBARRASSMENT --


                 How long did it take you to look that up?


                 How long did it take you to program the
                 virus that allowed you to cheat?

     The President smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't,
     it's just too damn entertaining...


                 Maybe you just don't like that I beat
                 your test.


                 I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our
                 vernacular. I've simply made the logical
                 deduction that you're a liar.


                 What an idiot I am for taking that
                 personally --


                 Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to
                 divine the purpose of the test.





                Enlighten me again.


                The purpose is to experience fear. Fear
                in the face of certain death. To accept
                that fear and maintain command of one's
                self and one's crew. This is a quality
                expected in every Starfleet captain.

     Kirk absorbs that.   Then --


                So you're telling me the point.      Of the
                whole thing. Is to be afraid?


                Fear is necessary, yes.


                Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?


                Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no
                additional training to control my
                narcissism when making command decisions.

     No he DIN'T!   Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all
     but "OOOOOOHs." But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.


                You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan.
                And I'm sure you're really proud of that,
                who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you
                people don't experience fear at all?

     ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter
     how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood -



                And if that's the case -- What's that say
                about your ability to make command
                decisions?

     Well. Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot.
     And before this lovefest can continue --




     A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they
     all do -- now we're SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT, who runs to
     the President, hands him a DATAPAD. President reads it.
     Everyone watches, on edge -- finally, quietly:


                        
                We've received a distress call from
                Vulcan.
                        
                Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic
                probation pending the result of your
                hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle
                Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is
                at recess until further notice --
                dismissed.

     Everyone's on their feet, MOVING QUICKLY, Kirk suddenly
     irrelevant. PIKE passes by him, all fucking business, but
     before he goes --


                Cheating isn't winning.

     And as that settles on Kirk, McCoy now joins him. The two
     exiting with the rest of the cadets as Kirk eyes SPOCK --


                Who was that pointy-eared bastard?


                I don't know, but I like him.



     DOLLY THROUGH HUNDREDS OF CADETS, racing to their shuttles --
     BARRACKS LEADERS stand on platforms, calling out SHIP
     ASSIGNMENTS -- cadets HURRYING OFF as they're called --


     Blake! U.S.S. Newton!             Jaxa! The U.S.S. Endeavor!
     Counter! U.S.S. Odyssey!          T'nag! The U.S.S. Antares!
     Fugeman: Regula One! Gerace:      Pomoroy! The U.S.S. Oddyssey!
     U.S.S. Farragut! McGrath!         Leifer! U.S.S. Newton!
     U.S.S. Wolcott! McCoy!            Uhura! The U.S.S. Farragut!
     U.S.S. Enterprise! Welcome to
     Starfleet and Godspeed!

     As the last of the cadets head off, Kirk stands there without a
     home -- he moves to his exiting Barracks Leader --


                Excuse me, you didn't call my name.
                Kirk, James T..





                          
                  You're on academic probation. That means
                  you're grounded until the Academy Board
                  rules.

     Kirk is POLEAXED as Leader heads off -- McCoy, needing to run:


                  ... Jim, the Board'll rule in your favor.
                  Most likely.
                          
                  Look, Jim -- I gotta go --


                  ... yeah-- yeah, you go... I'm good.

     Kirk forces a half-smile. Torn, McCoy hurries off. PULL AWAY
     from Kirk, alone as the mass of newly-minted cadets criss-
     crosses around him. At the hangar entrance, McCoy suddenly
     STOPS: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk, pulls him off:


     Come with me --                    -- what're you doing --?

     TRACK with them as they hurry through the throng of cadets --
     and suddenly we're moving in the OTHER DIRECTION as a pissed-off
     Uhura serpentines through the group to SPOCK --


                  Commander, a word?

     Spock moves away from the officers, a private moment with her:


                  Yes, Lieutenant?


                  Was I not one of your top students?


                  Indeed you were --


                  Did I not receive a Gold rating for
                  Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet
                  first place over Kyoto and MIT at the
                  Oxford Invitational?

     A LOUD nearby SHUTTLE LEAVES BEHIND THEM -- it gets WINDY --


                  An exceptional achievement, to be su--





                -- and did I not, on multiple occasions,
                demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity
                and, I quote, "unparalleled ability to
                identify sonic anomalies" in subspace
                transmission tests?!


                Consistently, yes--


                And while you were well aware that my
                unqualified desire was to serve on the
                U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the
                Farragut.

     Spock reacts unusually; he seems almost embarrassed.   Quiet.


                It was an attempt to avoid the appearance
                of favoritism.

     She gets closer, voice low, all pride and defiance:


                No. No. I am assigned to the
                Enterprise.

     Their eyes hold.    He checks his tablet, makes an change:


                Oh.     Yes, I believe you are.



     McCoy and Kirk enter fast. McCoy goes through a cabinet, preps
     a med in a hypospray SYRINGE.


                What are you doing?


                Doing you a favor. I couldn't just leave
                you there, looking all pitiful-- roll up
                your sleeve, I'm gonna give you a vaccine
                against viral infection from Melvaran mud
                fleas.

     McCoy FIRES the Hypospray --





      Ow-- what for?                      To give you symptoms.
      -- I don't understand--             -- you're gonna start to lose
                                          vision in your left eye --
      -- yeah, I already have --          -- don't stand up yet --
         (he tries to stand;

      -- what'd you do to me?             -- you're gonna get a really
                                 bad headache. And flopsweat.
      -- this is a favor?!                -- yeah, you're welcome.

      McCoy ushers Kirk out of the room --



      McCoy ushers Kirk to a shuttle -- a SCANNING OFFICER stops them:


                   "Kirk, James T." -- he's not cleared for
                   duty aboard the Enterprise --


                   But I am, and Medical Code states the
                   treatment and transport of a patient's to
                   be determined at the discretion of his
                   attending physician, which is me.
                           
                   You can see he's suffering, he needs me
                   as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to
                   this ship, so's he, or would you like to
                   explain to Captain Pike why the
                   Enterprise warped into a crisis without
                   one of its medical officers?


                   ... as you were.


                   As you were.

      And with that, he pulls Kirk past the speechless officer --



      A fleet of SHUTTLES depart Starfleet -- head out to space --



      Kirk, in agony, sweating, sits beside McCoy as they pass through
      the stratosphere. McCoy's peering out a window --


                   I might throw up on you.





                  You should look at this.

     And through his pain, Kirk does... and is amazed...



     The shuttle approaches a massive DOCKING STATION where a dozen
     STARFLEET VESSELS ARE DOCKED. But the ship we're approaching is
     miraculous: "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701" IS REVEALED ON THE HULL

     AND READY FOR HER MAIDEN VOYAGE. The shuttle glides to the
     underside of the Enterprise. A DOCKING BAY opens --



     Officers move quickly on the ship -- Kirk and McCoy enter.    Kirk
     WIPING HIS BROW, pretty much SOAKED.


                  Bones. Thanks for getting me on board.
                  But I don't feel right. I feel like I'm
                  leaking.


                  Oh look, the pointy-eared bastard.

     Kirk looks up -- SPOCK moves towards them, not seeing them --
     Kirk yanks McCoy out of the way -- Spock passes and enters a
     TURBOLIFT -- Kirk looks back as the doors close.

     Then we go INTO THE TURBOLIFT -- for just a moment -- as the
     doors open and we enter with Spock:



     Spock walks through the glorious, gleaming new space, taking his
     position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE. PIKE at the command chair.


                  Captain, engineering reports "ready for
                  launch".


                  The maiden voyage of our newest flagship
                  deserves more pomp and circumstance than
                  we can afford today, but her christening
                  will have to be our reward for a safe
                  return--
                          
                  All decks, this is Captain Pike. Prepare
                  for immediate departure. Helm,
                  thrusters.




      WHIP PAN to the helm: HIKARU SULU turns to Pike -- at 25, he's
      the Federation's best pilot. As he works the controls:


                   Moorings retracted, Captain. Dock
                   Control reports ready -- thrusters fired,
                   separating from space dock --



      The Enterprise moves away from the dock -- smaller SATELLITE
      crafts floating around it. The other FIVE STARFLEET SHIPS
      already ahead -- moving into position.



      MEDICAL STAFF preps. McCoy enters with Kirk, in amusing agony --
      McCoy helps him onto a bed, prepares another hypospray.


      -- oh, this wasn't worth it --
      I wish I didn't know you-- I'm
      itching in my mouth, this is         Here's a short-lasting
      horrible--                           sedative -- those symptoms
                                           won't last long, don't be an
                                           infant.

      And he SHOOTS KIRK with another hypospray --





      As Sulu works the controls --


                   The fleet's cleared space dock, Captain.
                   All ships ready for warp.


                   Set course for Vulcan.


                   Course laid in.


                   Maximum warp.    Punch it.

      And Sulu does and --



      The six ships -- ONE, then TWO, then THREE, then FOUR, then FIVE
      SNAP INTO WARP. The Enterprise, however... just sits there.






      Pike -- and the others -- look at Sulu, who is confused --
      concerned -- searching the controls. Finally:


                 Lieutenant, where's Helmsman McKenna?


                 Uh, he has lungworms, Sir? He'll be fine
                 but couldn't report to his post-- I'm
                 Hikaru Sulu --


                         
                 -- and you are a pilot, right?


                 Very much so, Sir-- I'm not sure
                 what's... wrong here...


                 Is the parking brake on?


                         
                 -- no, I'll figure it out, just--


                 Have you disengaged the External Inertial
                 Dampener?

      Sulu does -- and realizes Spock is right.     He makes it work.


                 Ready for warp, Sir.


                 The external inertial dampener.
                 That's... the parking brake.


                         
                 ... yessir.


                         
                 Let's punch it!



      And now alone, the Enterprise SNAPS INTO WARP -- and is gone.






      CLOSE ON a small Vulcan object. SHAKING, as if in a small
      earthquake. BOOM UP to find Amanda as she moves through her
      home, out to the balcony -- and in the distance, a mile away, is
      a massive COLUMN OF LIGHT -- like a ray from God, which creates
      NUKE-LIKE CONCENTRIC CLOUDS and massive DIRT AND DUST, slamming
      into the ground. Amanda's eyes go wide with terror --



      Looking DOWN towards Vulcan at the gigantic DRILLING PLATFORM,
      the SOURCE of the PLASMA RAY -- and we TILT UP to see that the
      platform is HUNG ON A WIDE TETHER -- and we KEEP TILTING UNTIL
      WE SEE THE TETHER IS ATTACHED TO THE NARADA, in orbit above the
      planet --



      Nero stares at holographic images of Vulcan -- as Ayel arrives
      behind him.


                 Captain Nero, drilling has begun.


                 Prepare the Red Matter.    Tell me when we
                 reach core depth.

      Ayel heads off --



      Ayel enters the massive hangar -- where SPOCK'S JELLYFISH SHIP
      SITS. Ayel moves to, enters the Jellyfish --



      Ayel moves into the CONTAINMENT HOLD -- a METALLIC ROOM
      containing a large, floating RED BALL -- some kind of energy
      source. Ayel observes TWO ROMULANS EXTRACTING some of this Red
      Matter, sucking it into a tube --



      Workers place the tube of Red Matter into a SPACE POD.



      The journey's underway.   The bridge crew monitors systems:


                 Engines at Maximum Warp, Captain.





                  Russian whiz kid-- what's your name
                  again? Chanko? Cherpov?

     An 18 YEAR-OLD FACE leans into frame.   HEAVY RUSSIAN ACCENT:


                  Ensign Chekov, Pavel H., Sir.


                  Fine, Chekov, Pavel H.: begin shipwide
                  mission broadcast.


                  Yessir, happy to.
                          
                  Ensign authorization code: Nine-Five-
                  Wictor Wictor-Two--

     "AUTHORIZATION NOT RECOGNIZED, PLEASE TRY AGAIN." Chekov is a
     genius, a graduate of the academy at seventeen -- he sighs:


                  Aigh, thees is the 23rd Century -- what
                  good is woice recognition that doesn't
                  recognize your woice?
                          
                  Nine-Five-Victor-Victor-Two.




                  Your attention, plees: At twenty-two
                  hundred hours, telemetry detected an
                  anomaly in the Neutral Zone. What
                  appeared to be a lightning storm in
                  space.



     CHEKOV'S FACE appears on monitors throughout the great ship,
     including ENGINEERING: CRANE DOWN 12 stories of catwalks as
     engineers tend to the DILITHIUM CRYSTAL CHAMBER that operates
     the warp drive --


                  Soon after, Starfleet received a distress
                  signal from the Vulcan High Council that
                  their planet was experiencing seismic
                  activity. We then lost contact with
                  Vulcan entirely.

     WEAPONS BAY: TRACKING DOWN rows of PHOTON TORPEDOES stacked for
     war -- WEAPONS OFFICERS arming the cannons.




     VARIOUS SHOTS of the Crew at work in DIFFERENT SHIP LOCALS.


                  Our mission is to assess the condition of
                  Vulcan and assist in evacuations, if
                  necessary.

     MEDICAL BAY: as the med staff sets up a triage area --


                  We should be arriving at Vulcan within
                  two minutes. Thank you for your time.

     And as Chekov's message ends, Kirk suddenly SITS UP IN FRAME --
     his mind SPINNING, through the pain and sedative -- he tries to
     get off the bed, to his feet, as McCoy hurries over --


                  Jim, I told you to stay d-- good God!

     What McCoy has just seen -- what we and Kirk see now -- is that



                  -- what's this?!


                  -- I don't know-- a reaction to the
                  vaccine -- damnit --

     Kirk rushes to the video monitor where Chekov was seen -- using
     his huge hands, he REWINDS CHEKOV'S SPEECH -- replays this part
     as McCoy SCANS KIRK WITH A HANDHELD DIAGNOSER --


                  -- telemetry detected an anomaly in the
                  Neutral Zone. What appeared to be a
                  lightning storm in space.

     He FREEZES it -- eyes wild -- looks to McCoy --


                  -- Bones -- we have to stop the ship--


                  -- you're not allergic to Cardassian vole
                  dander, are you?


                  --- what? How the hell would I know?     Is
                  Uhura on board?





                You need an antidote, Jim, or you're
                gonna die.







                 Jim, I'm not kidding, you gotta keep your
                 heart rate down.


                 Computer, locate crew member Uhura --


                 I haven't seen a reaction this severe
                 since Med school.

      A MAP appears -- locates her --


                 Lieutenant Uhura is at signals monitoring
                 station twelve -- deck four.


                 We're flying into a trap.

      Kirk RUNS OUT -- McCoy hurrying after him with a bag of gear:


                 You're delusional, you know that.




      Kirk and McCoy enter -- Kirk stops, looks around --


                 Come here -- Jim -- don't move --

      And McCoy INJECTS HIM WITH ANOTHER SHOT --


                 -- ow!   Stop it!

      And Kirk runs into a ENORMOUS SPACE -- giant STEEL COLLECTOR
      TANKS surround a dozen workstations where CREW MEMBERS collect
      data -- Kirk races to Uhura --


                 The transmission from the Klingon prison
                 planet -- what exactly did you hear?


                 What are you doing here-- what happened
                 to your hands?!




      Kirk hides his hands behind his back -- as he talks it becomes



                   Who was it who escaped? What was the
                   ship that was stolen--?!
                           (to McCoy,
                            indiscernible)
                   -- what's happening to my mouth?


                           
                   -- you've got Numb Tongue --


                           
                   Numb tongue?


                   That's not good-- I can fix that--

      Kirk grabs a pen with his huge hands and writes -- shows her
      what he's written: "THE SHIP - WAS IT ROMULAN?" Uhura looks at
      him -- somehow scared -- as McCoy INJECTS HIM AGAIN:






      EPIC WIDE SHOT: Amanda's a spec against the MASSIVE, EAR-
      SPLITTING PLASMA TWISTER. The image is almost religious. POP
      CLOSER to her face -- mesmerized, terrified -- suddenly: a
      HOVERSPEEDER RACES IN behind her, at the controls is SAREK:


                          


      She turns to him in horror --






      Bridge doors WHOOSH OPEN as Kirk RUNS IN, followed by Uhura and
      a harried McCoy --


                   Captain Pike-- Sir, we have to stop ship!





      -- Mr. Kirk! How the hell did
      you get on board the                 This man is under the
      Enterprise?!                         influence of a severe reaction
                                           to a vaccine. He is
                                           delusional and I take full
                                           responsibility for --


                   Vulcan isn't experiencing a natural
                   disaster, it's being attacked -- by
                   Romulans.

      ON THE CREW as that lands.     But most specifically, SPOCK.


                   Cadet Kirk, I think you've had enough
                   attention for one day -- Dr. McCoy,
                   return to medical, we'll have words
                   later.


                   Yessir.

      Rebuked, McCoy exits as:


      As you know, Mr. Kirk is not
      cleared to be aboard this
      vessel. By Starfleet                  Yeah, I get it, you're a
      regulations, that makes him a        great arguer, I'd love to do
      stowaway...                          it again with you, too.

      I can remove the cadet from          -- Try it! This cadet is
      the bridge, Sir --                   trying to save the bridge!
      -- By recommending a full stop
      in trans-warp in the midst of
      a rescue mission?                    -- It's not a rescue mission--
                                           listen to me! It's an attack!
      -- Based on what facts?

      ON KIRK.   Enough.     And cadet or not, the bridge is HIS.


                   Fact: the same anomaly -- a lighting
                   storm in space -- that we saw today also
                   occurred on the day of my birth, before a
                   Romulan ship attacked the U.S.S. Kelvin.
                           
                   You know that, I read your dissertation.
                   Which was good.





                 Fact: This ship -- which had formidable
                 and advanced weaponry -- was never seen
                 or heard from again -- fact: the Kelvin
                 attack took place on the edge of Klingon
                 space and at 11-hundred hours last night
                 there was an escape from a Klingon prison
                 planet -- Rura Penthe -- fact: the
                 escaped prisoners were Romulans, Sir, and
                 it was reported that they stole a ship
                 from the prison dock.


                 And you know of this prison escape how?

      Kirk just points to Uhura.


                 Sir, I-- I intercepted and translated the
                 message myself. Kirk's report is
                 accurate.


                 We're warping into a trap-- there are
                 Romulans waiting for us, I promise you
                 that.

      All eyes on Pike.   He looks to Spock, who could screw Kirk
      here... But--


                 The cadet's logic is sound.
                         
                 And Lieutenant Uhura is unmatched in
                 xenolinguistics, we would be wise to
                 accept her conclusion.


                         
                 Scan Vulcan space, check if any
                 transmissions are being made in Romulan.


                 Sir, I'm-- not sure I could distinguish
                 the Romulan language from Vulcan.


                         
                 How about you -- you speak Romulan,
                 Cadet...?


                 Uhura, Sir.   All three dialects.





                   Uhura, relieve the Lieutenant -- Mr.
                   Hannity, hail the U.S.S. Truman.

      Uhura sits at the console -- she PUTS ON THE EARPIECE. We've
      just watched the birth of an icon. She works the controls --


                   The other ships are out of warp and have
                   arrived at Vulcan, Sir-- but we seem to
                   have lost all contact--


                   Captain, I pick up no Romulan
                   transmissions -- or transmissions of any
                   kind in the area. There seems to be
                   something jamming all communication
                   around Vulcan.


                   It's because they're being attacked.
                   Captain. Please.


                           
                   Shields up. Ready all weapons.

      LIGHTS GO RED. HOLD ON THE FACES of our people -- AFRAID,
      HEARTS POUNDING as they dread what they're about to see --


                   Arrival at Vulcan in five seconds!
                   Four... three... two--







      Sulu   DIPS the Enterprise FAST AND HARD and the spinning debris
      JUST   SCARS the ship. The bridge shakes, but rights itself. THE

      WIDE   AT THE MONUMENTAL SHIP -- meanwhile, inside:





      A PROXIMITY ALARM rings out --


                   Sir, another Federation ship!





                   Destroy it, too.



      Spock snaps to Pike as images FLASH on his console --


                   Captain, they're locking torpedoes!


                   Full reverse, come about Starboard ninety
                   degrees! Drop us down underneath them!
                   Prepare to fire all weapons!



      The Narada FIRES A TORPEDO and in a wild move, the Enterprise
      DROPS AND TUMBLES -- the SEPARATING TORPEDO passes RIGHT BETWEEN
      THE ENTERPRISE'S NACELLES -- ONE PIECE HITS our hero ship's
      DEFLECTOR DISH -- another the MAIN DISH and --



      A CREW MEMBER runs through the machine room catwalks as a HUGE
      EXPLOSION sends him -- and large steel tanks -- TUMBLING INTO


      We see the ship from a distance -- the scale of the destruction
      relatively small --




                   Shields at thirty-two percent! Their
                   weapons are powerful, Sir, we can't take
                   another hit like that!


                   Get me Starfleet Command!






                   Captain, the Romulan ship has lowered
                   some kind of high energy pulse device
                   into the Vulcan atmosphere-- its signal
                   appears to be blocking our communications
                   and transporter abilities!





                   All power to forward shields -- prepare
                   to fire all weapons!






      Photons LOADED fast by CREW MEMBERS and --





      The Enterprise SWOOPS AROUND, firing photons at the Narada which
      takes the hits in stride --



      The bridge in action --


                 Fire torpedoes, take them out--!

      And just before our heroes are blown into oblivion, Nero
      suddenly LURCHES FORWARD and stabs out a hand:




      Nero's eyes are hard and bright as diamond drills:


                 The hull -- magnify --

      On screen, the Enterprise's hull is revealed "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE
      NCC-1701." Nero LIGHTS UP with recognition --



      Pike on the comm:


                 Divert auxiliary power from port nacelle
                 to the shields--!

      But Pike stops when he sees, on the viewscreen


                 Captain, we're being hailed!

      Pike looks over -- nods -- Uhura works controls and on
      viewscreen, Nero appears. Cool. Cordial. In English:


                 Hello.


                 I am Captain Christopher Pike, to whom am
                 I speaking?





                   I am called Nero.

      CLOSE ON KIRK -- breathless -- suddenly staring at the man who
      murdered his father -- holy SHIT...


                   You've declared war against the
                   Federation. Withdraw, and I'll agree to
                   arrange a conference with Romulan
                   leadership at a neutral loca--


                   I do not speak for the Empire. We stand
                   apart. As does your Vulcan crew
                   member... isn't that right? Spock?

      All eyes on Spock.   Spock looks to Pike, who nods permission:


                           
                   Pardon me. But I don't believe you and I
                   are acquainted.


                   ... no, we're not. Not yet.
                           
                   I would like you to see something.
                   Spock.
                           
                   Captain Pike-- your transporter
                   capability is disabled. You will man a
                   shuttle and come aboard the Narada for
                   negotiations. That is all.

      The transmission ENDS.   The crew stares in grave anticipation --


      -- he'll kill you, you know
      that--                               Your survival is unlikely--
      -- Captain, we gain nothing by
      diplomacy-- going over to that       -- I, too, suggest you rethink
      ship is a mistake.                   this strategy.


                   I understand that --
                           
                   I need officers who have been trained in
                   advanced hand-to-hand combat!

      Sulu's hand goes up --


                   I have training, Sir!





                 Then come with me -- Kirk, you too--
                 you're not supposed to be here anyway.
                         
                 Radio the engine room, have Chief
                 Engineer Olsen meet us at Shuttle Bay
                 Five.


                 Aye, Keptin.


                 Let's go.

      Bridge doors WHOOSH open -- they EXIT.





      WE TRACK FAST with Pike, Kirk, Spock and Sulu as they HURRY
      through the Enterprise toward the shuttle bay:


                 Without transporters, we can't beam off
                 the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do
                 our job. I'm creating an opportunity:
                 Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will
                 space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have
                 chutes -- you'll land on that machine
                 they've lowered into the atmosphere
                 that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get
                 inside, disable that thing then beam back
                 to the ship.

      Kirk and Sulu share a HOLY FUCKING SHIT look --


                 ... okay.


                 Mr. Spock, I'm leaving you in command of
                 the ship. Once we have transport
                 capability and communications back up,
                 you'll contact Starfleet and report what
                 the hell's happening here.





                   Something you've got only precious few
                   minutes to figure out. If all else
                   fails, fall back and rendezvous with the
                   fleet in the Laurentian System.
                           
                   Kirk. I'm promoting you to First
                   Officer.



      What!?!                           -- Captain?


                   While I'm gone we need to keep the chain
                   of command. And you two make a swell
                   team.


                   Captain. Please. I apologize, but the
                   complexities of human pranks escape me.


                   It's not a prank, Spock.   And I'm not the
                   Captain. You are.

      And with that, he's DONE. Strides off.     Kirk finally shakes off
      the shock of his PROMOTION --


                   Once we knock out that machine... Sir,
                   what happens to you?


                   I guess you'll have to come get me.
                           
                   Careful with the ship. She's brand new.

      They appreciate the pure BALLS of that. BRAVERY washes over
      them -- they'd fucking DIE for their Captain, who now turns to
      Kirk and Sulu --


                   Suit up, Gentlemen.



      Sarek's hovercraft speeds along the desert floor, arriving at a
      massive CAVE OPENING -- he and Amanda hurry off the craft --
      into the cave --






     Bridge doors WHOOSH open -- all eyes on Spock as he enters --
     their new captain. With cold certainty, he takes the command
     chair, hits the intercom:


                 Dr. Puri, report --



     CHAOS, UTTER AND COMPLETE. WOUNDED MEN AND WOMEN, it's bad,
     bloody -- a HAND hits an intercom: McCoy, badly shaken --


                 It's McCoy-- Dr. Puri was on Deck 6, he's
                 dead.


                         
                 Then you have just inherited his
                 responsibility as Chief Medical Officer.


                 Aye, Sir.






      QUICK CUTS: Kirk, Sulu, and the ship's LEAD ENGINEER OLSON are
      suiting up for the drop, strapping on sleek AIRDROP ARMOR. WEB




      They race into the shuttle and take seats facing each other
      across a narrow aisle -- Red Shirt Engineer GRINS like he's
      going on a ski trip:


                 I am pumped to kick some Romulan ass!   No
                 joke. BRING IT ON!

      Kirk nods at him -- subtext: "What a fucking sack."     He looks to
      Sulu.


                 So what kinda combat training d'you have?


                         
                 Fencing.


                         
                 ... fencing.

      In the COCKPIT, Pike works the controls -- MOTORS WHINE and the
      craft LURCHES --



      We see the shuttle LEAVE THE DOCK --



      The shuttle soars from the Enterprise bay, the planet Vulcan a
      red orb below... THRUSTERS FLARE as it descends and now we





      The shuttle GLIDES to a hover, 60,000 FEET ABOVE THE DRILL --






      A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling depressurization of the cargo lock --
      the guys ready their equipment, snatching for handstraps,
      standing on the lip of THE AIRLOCK -- Kirk and Sulu meet eyes
      through their helmet faceplates, the point of no return --
      PIKE'S VOICE over their headsets:


                 Pre-jump on one: Three, two, one.





                 Good luck.

      Pike hits another control -- as the shuttle BOMB BAY DOORS OPEN -
      - and KIRK, SULU, AND RED SHIRT ARE INSTANTLY PULLED OUT, INTO:











      The falling trio TRACKED ON SCREEN, everyone watches, agape:


                 Away team's entering the atmosphere --

      SPOCK and UHURA meet eyes -- this is fucking insane -- and a
      MAN'S ENTHUSIASTIC YELLING takes us to:













      -- their chutes SNAP OPEN -- JERKING THEM HARD UPWARD AS THE RED














      Kirk approaches -- more terrified than ever -- he comes in hard,
      too -- SLAMS against the drill edge, bounces but quickly gets
      his footing -- hits a button on his chute and SLITS appear in
      the fabric, suddenly there's no more drag and THE CHUTE AUTO-
      RETRACTS into Kirk's pack -- A REUSABLE PARACHUTE.

      BUT SULU ISN'T SO LUCKY: 20 yards from the drill surface his
      chute gets SNARED IN THE CABLES, JERKING him upside down -- the
      WIND is so intense Sulu is BLOWN SIDEWAYS -- his CHUTE LINES
      begin RUBBING on the sharp metal of the suspension rig! Kirk
      holds on to one of the chute's cables -- yells up:




      As Kirk tries to climb up, Sulu's cables begin to SNAP! ONE BY
      ONE -- and Sulu tries to CLIMB BACK using his chute cables,
      toward the rig -- otherwise he's gonna fly off.

      As Kirk makes his way up the rig, suddenly:




      Kirk SPINS just as a Romulan appears -- tackling Kirk to the
      drill platform! The two FIGHT PRECARIOUSLY ON THE EDGE OF THE
      SWIRLING PLASMA DRILL, WIND ROARING -- and suddenly there's
      ANOTHER ROMULAN from an OPEN HATCH! SULU SLIDES DOWN THE CABLE -
      - JUMPING and tackling the second guard and the shit is ON: our
      Starfleet heroes battling these Romulans to the death -- and
      Sulu KICKS OFF AN ANTENNA PIECE and uses it as a SABER --
      fucking swashbuckling at 10,000 feet! It's a frenzied assault
      even the bigger Romulan isn't ready for, and Sulu manages to
      KICK him into the vortex, where he's VAPORIZED as --

      KIRK draws his PHASER and point-blank SHOOTS the Romulan,
      knocking him clear OFF the cylinder and into the sky, falling to
      his death, DISINTEGRATING as he falls --

      Against pummeling wind, Kirk and Sulu move toward the HATCH --
      OPEN IT -- as:








      Pike's SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS. Pike steps out. Surrounded by a
      dozen of Nero's men. Ayel steps forward. Pike stands firm,
      knowing this is the end for him:


                 I'm Captain Christopher Pi--

      WHACK! He's cut off by a PUNCH to the face. Drops to his
      knees. Looks up at Ayel with blazing eyes, wipes a trickle of
      blood from his lip:


                 So much for diplomacy.

      He's DRAGGED AWAY as --



      Kirk and Sulu DROP IN through the outer hatch to find a control
      console, Sulu madly flips switches, no luck --


                 None of this is familiar-- the interface,
                 the controls--


      Step back--                       -- what, you have an idea?
      -- yeahyeah, I do--

      Kirk FIRES his PHASER at the console, BLASTING IT --



      The immense column of light DISAPPEARS, leaving only a towering,
      swirling vortex of DIRT --



      Uhura's console LIGHTS UP with activity:


                 The jamming signal's gone --
                 communications are re-established --


                 Transporter control re-engaged --

      Spock looks up from his console, grave --





                   Chekov, run gravitational sensors -- I
                   want to know what they're doing to the
                   planet.


                   Aye, Commander-- Keptin, sorry.    Keptin.



      A Romulan Helmsman RUNS to Nero --


                   The drill's been sabotaged, Sir.

      Nero, mind racing --


                   Launch the red matter. Now.



      The POD we saw earlier is FIRED from the ship -- it WHIPS past.



      Kirk and Sulu pull themselves from the control cockpit back out
      onto the drill's outer hull, they start to hear a SOUND... A





      And for an instant... nothing. What looks like a puff of smoke
      billowing up from the planet's core... THEN A SHOCKWAVE BLASTS




                   Kirk to Enterprise -- they just launched
                   something toward the planet!
















                   Keptin: gravitational sensors are off the
                   scale -- if my calculations are correct,
                   that pod they launched is creating a
                   singularity... that will consume the
                   planet.


      STIRRING INSIDE HIM -- Uhura watches Spock, heartsick for him:


                   They're creating a black hole... at the
                   center of Vulcan?


                   ... yessir.


                   How long does the planet have?


                   ... minutes, Sir. I'd say minutes.


                           
                   Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a
                   planetwide evacuation-- all channels, all
                   frequencies -- maintain standard orbit --


                   What?   Spock, wait --

      She goes after him as he moves to the TURBOLIFT --


                   -- where are you going?


                   To evacuate the Vulcan High Council--
                   they're tasked with protecting our
                   cultural history. My parents will be
                   among them--


                   -- you can't beam them out?


                   It's not possible -- they'll be in the
                   Katrik Arc, I must get them myself--








      HOLOGRAMS of VULCAN UNDER DESTRUCTION -- Nero watching them,
      pleased. He turns to Ayel --


                   Retract the drill, let's move out!



      The drill platform LURCHES -- begins RETRACTING --



      The platform BANKS -- Sulu FALLS BACK, OFF THE PLATFORM --
      WITHOUT A CHUTE! Kirk, holding on, watching this wide-eyed --
      and knowing what he must do, he RUNS AND JUMPS --

      KIRK FALLS FAST, he's only gonna have one shot at this, presses
      his arms to his sides and ROCKETS downward, building speed, four
      hundred feet below is Sulu, FREEFALLING --

      KIRK moves his feet and hands, angling toward him -- slashing
      downward at 160 mph, closing like a missile -- the gap between
      them narrows -- Sulu's 30 feet below him... 5000 feet to the
      planet surface. 40 ft -- 20 -- 10 -- WHAM! Kirk slams into
      Sulu in a mid-air tackle -- they TUMBLE TOGETHER -- Kirk's made
      the grab and locked his arms around Sulu in an iron grip,
      screams in his face:




      Sulu DOES -- it opens -- but HOLY FUCK, the double weight RIPS









      The TRANSPORTER CHIEF works his controls, sweating -- trying to



                   I'm trying!   I can't lock on your signal!



      SNAP AROUND as Chekov hears this -- watching his controls --
      Uhura watching too --





                   -- you're moving too fast!


                   -- no-- I can do that-- I CAN DO THAT!!!

      Chekov suddenly BOLTS -- Uhura watches him race off -- a CREW
      MEMBER steps into frame:


                   The black hole's expanding, we won't
                   reach minimum safe distance if we don't
                   leave immediately!



      Chekov SPRINTS through CORRIDORS -- ENGINE ROOM -- YELLING:




      And we take him to:



      -- where he races to the controls, out of breath, yelling:





      -- and he begins working the controls --



      Kirk and Sulu SPEED-DROPPING -- TERRIFIED --






      Chekov's manipulating a joystick-like TARGETING DISPLAY --
      trying to match the CROSSHAIRS on the DROPPING FIGURES --


                   -- holdonholdonholdonholdon!



      A massive SHEET OF LAVA, MILES HIGH, BURSTS INTO THE SKY -- Kirk
      and Sulu enter frame, BULLET-WHOOSH right past us, DROPPING --





                           




      TIGHT ON CHEKOV as he struggles to lock onto them -- BEEP!


                   Compensating gravitational pull and--


      He HITS A BUTTON and --








      AND PAINFUL, BUT SAFE! Transporter engineers GAPE in utter
      amazement and relief -- Chekov, sweating, laughs. Kirk and Sulu
      get their bearings, peeling themselves up, at stunned whispers:


                   ... thanks.


                   ... yeah, not a problem.

      And Kirk looks up as SPOCK hurries in --


                   Step aside -- I'm going to the surface.

      As the console ENGINEER works the display --


                   The surface of what? YOU'RE GOING DOWN
                   THERE? Are you nuts?!


                   Energize --

      And Spock DEMATERIALIZES --



      PUSH IN as Spock MATERIALIZES -- the distant landscape around
      him COLLAPSING, IMPLODING, EXPLODING -- he sprints for the
      MOUNTAIN -- the entrance to the ARK -- a scared, small CREATURE
      runs past Spock as he heads up the mountain -- rocks falling --






      Spock RACES through the tunnels as the world SHAKES around him --
      he enters the massive ARK CHAMBER -- sees, atop the enormous
      stairs, FIVE VULCAN ELDERS, Sarek among them, hands placed on
      the sarcophagus-like ark. Mind melding with it. Amanda is here
      too, kneeling beside Sarek -- and she sees her son, who is now
      RUNNING toward them -- she stands:


                 Spock--!

      Spock rushes up the stairs --


                 The planet's not safe, it has only
                 seconds left -- we must evacuate now --

      And as they run out, ENORMOUS ROCKS COLLAPSE AROUND THEM -- and
      they run through the tunnels, the STONE COLLAPSING AROUND THEM --



      Spock and the group finally emerge from the tunnels to see --
      THE PLANET IS COLLAPSING, COMING TOWARD THEM -- Spock whips
      open a tri-corder, TREMBLING LIKE CRAZY --


                 Spock to Enterprise: take us back now!



      Chekov works the controls:


                 Locking volume, transport in 5-4-3--







      TO DIE -- and Spock, trying to hold it together -- even though
      their transport hasn't yet begun -- looks at Amanda -- their
      eyes lock -- THE COLLAPSING GROUND RACING TOWARD THEM -- and in
      a surreal, intimate moment, Amanda says to Spock, quietly:


                 It's okay.   To be scared.




      PUSH IN ON SPOCK, looking at her -- as the LIGHT DARTS start
      TRACING THEM -- and they begin to EVAPORATE AS THE GROUND DROPS
      FROM UNDER AMANDA -- AND SHE'S SUCKED DOWN -- AWAY -- as Spock







      Chekov in a panic at the controls --




      -- as the Vulcans MATERIALIZE on the pad, Spock still REACHING
      for his mother -- but all he gets it the GHOSTLY IMAGE OF HER --


      as it lands -- Sarek too... a mother... a wife... has been lost.
      And Kirk stands nearby, having observed all of this, without
      anything to do or say... there's no cheating death.



      And the Enterprise BLASTS AWAY -- in the distance, THE ENTIRE


      And over this we HEAR:


                   Acting Captain's log. Stardate 2256.42:
                   I have assumed command of the Enterprise.






      SHOCK. The kind that crashes after the world's changed. In
      triage, the bay's filled with wounded Enterprise Officers. The
      Vulcan Elders and Sarek being examined as well. Kirk sits here,
      getting his hand bandaged from the fight. During this, he looks
      up, seeing one of the Elders being treated for a slight wound --
      her GREEN BLOOD seen through the bandage...


                   We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I
                   have therefore classified him a hostage
                   of the war criminal known as Nero.






      Spock sits in the captain's chair, reporting. He's glassy-eyed,
      staring at nothing as he speaks. Behind him, Uhura sits,
      watching, concerned.


                 Nero, who has destroyed my home planet.
                 And most of its six billion inhabitants.
                 I estimate no more than ten thousand
                 survived.
                         
                 While the essence of our culture has been
                 saved, in the elders who now reside upon
                 this ship... I am now a member of an
                 endangered species.

      Spock considers this. Clicks off the log recorder.     Spock moves
      off, into the turbolift -- Uhura follows him --



      Spock and Uhura. Silence hangs. She glances over, wanting to
      say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of
      his life. He looks at her, with kind eyes. And Uhura does
      something odd -- she STOPS the lift. Spock looks over as she
      wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him. Just
      holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and
      comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the
      intimacy before -- this is their secret...


                 I'm so sorry.

      Spock looks off, taking comfort, bewildered and lost...


                 What can I do?     Tell me what you need.


                 ... I need...

      He's on the verge of some emotional release... but self-
      consciousness returns and he clamps up, starting the lift again:


                 I need for us all to continue performing
                 admirably.

      He looks at her again -- gives her another kiss. The door opens
      and he exits. She watches him go -- and the door closes on her.






      Kirk comes down the hall, stretching his hand bandage -- when he
      stops. Standing at the other end of the corridor, operating a
      DATAPAD is a familiar-looking GREEN GIRL. Guilt overcomes him.
      After a beat he moves to her. Awkward.


                 Hey.
                         
                 Listen, about what happened at Starfleet.
                 The test and everything-- I know it looks
                 like I was... using you, or whatever.
                 And I'm sorry. I really am. And... I
                 just hope you'll forgive me.

      She just stares at him for a long beat, as if she's just pissed.
      But Kirk's face changes... and then he says:


                 ... you're not Gaila, are you?


                          
                 No.


                          
                 Sorry.

      And he walks off.   (NOTE: ALT. VERSION HAS GAILA SAYING, "I'M




      Uhura at her station, scanning for enemy signals -- all of our
      principals are here, in debate:


                 Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero
                 is headed for Earth?


                 Their trajectory suggests no other
                 destination, Captain.


                 Earth may be his next stop, but we have
                 to assume every Federation planet's a
                 target.


                 Yes, agreed-- but why didn't they destroy
                 us?





                   Why waste a weapon?      We weren't a threat.


                   That's not it.     He said he wanted me to
                   see something.     The destruction of my
                   home planet.


                   And how the hell did they do that by the
                   way? When did they jump so far ahead in
                   the arms race?


                   The engineering comprehension necessary
                   to artificially create a black hole may
                   suggest the answer: such technology could
                   theoretically be manipulated to create a
                   tunnel through space time.


                   Damnit, man, I'm a doctor, not a
                   physicist -- are you suggesting they're
                   from the future?


                   That is what he's suggesting and I don't
                   buy it.


                   If you eliminate the impossible, whatever
                   remains -- however improbable -- must be
                   the truth.


                   How poetic.


                   Then what would an angry future Romulan
                   want with Captain Pike?


                   As Admiral he knows details of
                   Starfleet's defenses.


                   What we need to do is catch up to that
                   ship. Disable it, take it over and get
                   Pike back.

      They're all looking at Kirk like he's nuts.





                         
                 Fantastic, I'm in.


                 Captain Pike left us with standing orders
                 to rendezvous with the fleet on the other
                 side of the quadrant.





                 We're technologically outmatched in every
                 way. A rescue attempt would be
                 illogical.


                 "Illogical"-- you're funny.


                 Not to mention we couldn't do it anyway:
                 Nero's ship would have to drop out of
                 warp for us to overtake them --


                 -- what about assigning Engineering crews
                 to try and boost our warp yield?


      Remaining power and crew are
      being used to repair radiation
      leaks on the lower decks and
      damage to the main deflector
      shield-- without which we
      cannot communicate with          -- okay--okay, okayokayokay--
      Starfleet.                       there's gotta be SOME WAY!


                 We must gather with the rest of Starfleet
                 to balance the terms of our next
                 engagement --


                 There won't be a next engagement, Spock:
                 by the time we've "gathered", it'll be
                 too late -- how many planets are you
                 willing to risk? You say he's from the
                 future? Knows what's gonna happen? Then
                 the logical thing is to be unpredictable.


                 You're assuming Nero knows how events are
                 predicted to unfold. The contrary:
                 Nero's very presence has altered the flow
                 of history, beginning with the attack on
                 the U.S.S. Kelvin, culminating in the
                 events of today -- thereby creating a new
                 chain of incidents that cannot be
                 anticipated by either party.


                 Does anyone understand him?


                         
                 ... an alternate reality.





                 Precisely. Whatever lives we might have
                 lived, if the time continuum was
                 disrupted... our destinies have changed.
                         
                 Mr. Sulu, plot a course for the
                 Laurentian system, Warp Factor Three--




      -- wait-- don't do that --
      Spock -- running back to the
      rest of the fleet for a confab
      is a massive waste of time--        -- These were the orders
      -- He also ordered us to go         Captain Pike issued when he
      back and get him! Spock,            left ship--
      you're Captain now--!               -- I am aware of my
      -- Every second we waste,           responsibilities, Mr. Kirk!
      Nero's getting closer to his
      next target--!                      -- that is correct -- and why
                                          I'm instructing you to accept
      -- I will not allow us to go        that I alone am in command.
      backwards, away from the
      problem, instead of hunting         -- then I must remove you from
      Nero down!                          this ship. If I confine you
                                          to the brig, you'll likely
                                          escape. Mr. Chekov: have

      them. Torn, Chekov and Sulu close in on Kirk --


                 I'm sorry.


                 Yeah, don't worry ab --

      -- but Kirk SWINGS, Sulu jerks, FASTER, spins, GRABS Kirk's
      wrist! Kirk ELBOWS him as Chekov reaches for his PHASER but
      Kirk SLAMS HIM, the phaser DROPS -- Kirk reaches for it but
      Spock's fingers CLAMP on Kirk's neck: THE VULCAN PINCH:





      On PIKE'S FACE, strapped to a TABLE.    Nero looks down upon him.





                   You are only the second human I have ever
                   met, face to face. You must have so many
                   questions for me.





                         
                 I only have one for you. I need the
                 subspace frequencies of Starfleet's
                 border detection grids. Specifically
                 those surrounding Earth.

      Pike looks up at him -- quiet rage.   Then --


                 Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S.
                 Enterprise, registry NCC-1701.


                 Christopher.
                         
                 Answer my question.


                 No. You answer for the genocide you just
                 committed on a peaceful planet--


                 I prevented genocide.
                         
                 Where I come from, Christopher... this
                 ship is just a mining vessel. I chose a
                 life of honest labor to provide for
                 myself... and the wife who was carrying
                 my child.
                         
                 I sit here now... knowing you as enemies.
                 Not just of today. But of tomorrow. I
                 watched as your Federation did nothing.
                 They let us burn to death... as our
                 planet broke in half.

      Curiosity behind Pike's eyes.


                 Then Nero, you're confused. Romulus has
                 not been destroyed. How can you blame
                 the Federation for something that hasn't
                 happened--?


                 It did happen. I remember it. I... felt
                 it.
                         
                 When I lost her... I promised myself I
                 would not speak another word until the
                 day of my retribution. In twenty five
                 years I forgot the sound of my own
                 voice... but I didn't forget the pain.
                 That feeling cannot be erased.





                         
                 A feeling that every surviving Vulcan now
                 shares.

      Pike just looks at him.   Sees how fucking far GONE he is.


                 If what you say is true... you can save
                 Romulus. You have a second chance to --


                 -- yes, which is a gift I won't waste on
                 mercy.
                         
                 My purpose, Christopher, is not simply to
                 avoid the destruction of the home I
                 love...
                         
                 ... but to create a Romulus which exists,
                 free of the Federation. Only then will
                 she be saved.

      And the "she" could refer to the planet... or to Nero's lost
      love. Either way, Pike knows a losing battle when he's fighting
      one. Ever so nobly, he quietly says --


                 Then we have nothing more to discuss.

      Nero reaches for something under the counter Pike lies upon.
      Retrieves A FAMILIAR GLASS CONTAINER -- inside -- DOZENS OF
      CENTAURIAN SLUGS, the very ones used on Nero.


                 It's not the fault of the human race that
                 Starfleet chose Earth as its center.
                 You're a more noble race than my fallen
                 cousins. I'll take no pleasure in your
                 extinction.


                 How reassuring.

      Nero opens the container, reaches for a pair of TONGS


                 The frequencies, please.


                 Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S.
                 Enterprise, registry NCC-1701.

      Nero sad-smiles.   What he expected.





                 As you wish.

      A ROMULAN GUARD HOLDS PIKE'S MOUTH -- Nero uses the tongs -- and




      Our POV is BLURRY. We come into FOCUS on a blinking instrument
      panel. KIRK is stirring awake, his shoulder kills. He sits up:
      inside a ONE-MAN POD CRAFT. He WIPES THE GLASS -- looks up --
      like a TUNNEL OF SNOW, 30 feet long, to the sky. THE PODCRAFT'S
      EMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OF A VAST, ICE PLANET. Kirk's been
      MAROONED. He closes his eyes, his face falls...


                 Computer...    where am I?


                 Current location Delta Vega: Class "M"
                 Planet, unsafe. You have been ordered to
                 remain in your pod until retrieved by
                 Starfleet authorities.


                 Bite me, how's that.

      The CANOPY RISES -- a blast of cold air hits Kirk -- with some
      agony, out he goes -- he CLIMBS UP THE TUBE OF SNOW -- and gets
      to the surface -- looks out. HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING
      NOWHERE. Finally:











      TRACKING along a massive ICE SHEET... Kirk ENTERS FRAME walking
      along, cold, pissed... whips out a TRICORDER, speaks into it:


                 Lieutenant's log, supplemental: I'm
                 preparing a testimonial for my Starfleet
                 court martial assuming there's still a
                 Starfleet left.

      From overhead, what we see -- what Kirk doesn't -- is something
      HUGE, SLITHERING UNDERWATER beneath the ice --





                   Acting Captain Spock -- whose only form
                   of expression's apparently limited to his
                   left damn eyebrow -- has marooned me on
                   Delta Vega in what I believe to be a
                   violation of security protocol 49.09,
                   governing the treatment of prisoners
                   aboard a st--



      Kirk FREEZES at a nearby GROWL. He looks -- sees nothing --
      then ANOTHER GROWL -- he turns -- some thirty feet away, an
      eleven foot-tall cross between a polar bear and a gorilla (it's
      a POLARILLA) steps out from behind a mass of ice. Sees Kirk.
      It's horrifying. Kirk takes a SLOW, SMALL STEP BACKWARD -- and
      the fucking thing CHARGES HIM -- KIRK RUNS, TERRIFIED -- and the
      POLARILLA PURSUES -- gaining -- it's gonna EAT HIM ALIVE WHEN









      FALLS -- DROPS -- and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE
      SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and
      ROARS LOUDLY -- until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature
      starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense
      creature TUMBLING not far behind!

      And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD -- sees a distant CAVE. Looks
      up at the FLAILING CREATURE that is about to CRUSH HIM -- Kirk
      tries to run, but the ice is TOO SLIPPERY -- FINALLY he gets
      footing and runs off toward the cave -- as the red creature
      LANDS HARD -- its sharp SPEAR LIMBS STAB into the ice as it
      pursues Kirk --



      Kirk races through the darkened cave -- the creature comes
      after him -- Kirk goes as fast as he can -- the creature reaches
      out and fucking GRABS HIM -- pulls him toward the disgusting,
      wet, TEETHY MOUTH -- Kirk tries to hold on to anything he can --
      but he's fucking LUNCH -- and just as you're SCREAMING, there's
      LIGHT -- FIRE LIGHT -- and a FIGURE APPEARS, WAVING A TORCH --

      And the red creature's eyes ALL GO WILD -- and it DROPS KIRK and
      BACKS OFF, AFRAID -- the figure CHASES IT until it's gone.
      Kirk, on the ground, is freaked out, out of breath, and can't
      take his eyes off this man... who says:





                   The Hen-Gra.   Notoriously afraid of heat.



      And the Figure turns... we may have recognized the voice.
      IT'S SPOCK. As in NIMOY. HERE. Lit in the darkness by the
      fire. We'll refer to him as SPOCK PRIME. He looks at Kirk --
      moves closer to him -- finally seeing him. And is amazed...


                   Hey... thank you...


                   ... Jim?


                           
                   -- how d'you know my name?


                   How did you find me--? Does Starfleet
                   know of my presence?




      Spock looks deep into the eyes of the freaked out young man,
      feeling the full effect of fate playing its hand, but realizing
      he doesn't recognize him...


                   I have been... and always shall be...
                   your friend.


                   -- no, I don't know you -- the only
                   Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy.

      Of all the things Spock predicted Kirk might say, it wasn't
      that. He's analyzing a thousand steps ahead, calculating:


                   You are James T. Kirk. Your father is
                   George, as is your brother. Your
                   mother's name is Winona -- you were born
                   in 2233 --


                   Stop.   Please.     I don't understand.

      As Spock nods, we PRE-LAP:





                   ... I am Spock. One hundred and thirty
                   years senior to the Vulcan you know.


                           
                   Bullshit.



      Firelight flickers -- shadows of Kirk and Spock Prime dance on
      the ice walls. Remarkable NIGHT STARS outside.


                   It's remarkably pleasing to see you
                   again.
                           
                   ... especially after the events of today.


                   Old friend. Sir, I don't have any idea
                   how you know what you know. But I don't
                   know you and if you are Spock we're not
                   friends. You hate me. You marooned me
                   here for mutiny...


                   Mutiny?   You are not the Captain?


                   You're the captain.   Pike was taken
                   hostage.


                           
                   ... by Nero.


                   What do you know about him?


                           
                   ... he is a remarkably...





                  troubled Romulan.
                          
                  ... Please. Allow me -- it will be
                  easier--

      Spock Prime reaches for Kirk's face -- Kirk grabs his wrist --


                  What're you doing--?

      A skeptical beat, but Kirk finally releases his hand. Spock
      gently places his fingers on Kirk's cheek and temple --


                          
                  Our minds... one and together...One
                  hundred and twenty-seven years from now
                  everything ends.

      Spock's eyes SNAP SHUT, Kirk JOLTS as if by an electric charge --
      and the SCREEN OVEREXPOSES TO WHITE as we CUT TO our MIND MELD




      A SUPERNOVA. An EXPLODING STAR, like a LIGHT, EATING AWAY AT



                  A star in Beta Quadrant will go supernova
                  -- and like a cancer left untreated... it
                  will grow... and destroy everything.



      Now we're seeing VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY -- where SIX VULCAN
      SCIENTISTS study a HOLOGRAM of this event -- the star's ORIGIN,
      its PATH OF DESTRUCTION -- and SPOCK PRIME is among them --


                  I saw the beginning of it myself. Vulcan
                  Science Academy devised a plan to stop
                  it.



      PUSH IN as the JELLYFISH SHIP is under construction --





                  We built a ship containing a material
                  capable of generating the only thing
                  powerful enough to consume a supernova.
                  A black hole.



      Now we're INSIDE the ship -- the CONTAINMENT HOLD -- being
      ASSEMBLED by Vulcan Scientists --


                  I agreed to pilot the ship. Knowing I
                  would not return.

164   Now we see Spock Prime, in a ritual ceremony of a Vulcan         164
      Kamikaze pilot. Tea, sipped inside the Ark --


                  My sacrifice, in service of all races,
                  seemed only logical.

      Now Spock Prime sits in the Jellyfish COCKPIT --


                  Unfortunately... before I could begin the
                  mission... the supernova destroyed
                  Romulus.



166   -- and suddenly we're OUT OF THE MIND MELD as KIRK GRABS SPOCK   166



                  Nero's planet was destroyed--


                  Yes. He of course blamed us. Believed
                  Vulcan allowed his planet to die. Which
                  was hardly the case. Let me continue.


      This annoys me, I don't like      -- I know, I know, I'm not
      it-- do we have to do it like     surprised to hear you complain
      this--?                           -- allow me to finish.

      Spock Prime touches Kirk again and we go:






      -- the JELLYFISH SWOOPS PAST US -- and we PAN -- and see the
      MASSIVE SUPERNOVA in the infinite distance -- no sense of scale
      here -- but then -- THE NARADA APPEARS -- FIRES TORPEDOES at the
      Jellyfish.


                   Nero came after me. Determined to thwart
                   my mission. If Romulus was allowed to
                   die, he said... all planets should share
                   its fate.





                   I needed an exit. I knew if this mission
                   failed... everyone, everywhere... would
                   lose everything.

      Spock Prime LEAVES the cockpit --



      Prime ENTERS AN AIRLOCK -- TUMBLES IN WEIGHTLESSNESS and enters
      THE CONTAINMENT ROOM. QUICK CUTS as he REMOVES RED MATTER FROM



                   I realized: a large black hole could
                   destroy the supernova. A smaller one...
                   could be my escape. Could send me back
                   in time, allowing me to complete my
                   mission. So I created a black hole...

      Spock loads the CANNISTER with a small amount of RED MATTER into
      a JETTISON TUBE --



      -- and he FIRES THE CANNISTER INTO SPACE --



      Spock Prime back in the cockpit -- takes aim on his controls and




      A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED -- Spock Prime PILOTS TOWARD THE HOLE --





                  Nero must have understood what I was
                  trying to do. Because he began racing
                  for it.

      The NARADA and the JELLYFISH aiming for the BLACK HOLE --





      Spock Prime watches as the NARADA GOES IN -- LIGHTNING STORM-
      STYLE DISAPPEARING FIRST -- then SPOCK PRIME'S FACE -- WHITE



                  Nero simply got to it first. How long I
                  was travelling... I couldn't tell you.
                  It was timeless. But when I arrived...

      LIGHT on Spock Prime's face goes away -- he and the Jellyfish
      are back in SPACE --





      -- but now, facing him, is the NARADA.


                  Nero was waiting for me.





      KIRK INHALES, SHARPLY, having been there with Spock Prime.    Back
      to the two men, in a cave:

      Kirk stares at him... his mind spinning because now he
      believes him. The result is overwhelmingly emotional.


                  Forgive me... emotional transference is
                  an effect of the mind meld.





                           
                   ... so you do feel...


                   "Cthia" is the stricture that binds our
                   emotions... but few of us are that
                   perfectly Vulcan.

      Kirk gathers himself, wipes his eyes on his sleeve...


                   Going back in time... you changed all our
                   lives.


                   Yet remarkably, events within our
                   timelines, characteristics, people...
                   seem to overlap significantly. Tell me
                   about the rest of the crew? Chekov--
                   Uhura --?


                   Tactical and Communications --


                   -- Sulu --


                   -- he's the helmsman, why?


                   Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here
                   is not a matter of coincidence... but
                   rather, indication of a higher purpose.


                   ... he'd call it a damn miracle.


                   Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's
                   way of attempting to mend itself. In
                   both our histories, the same crew found
                   its way onto the same ship in a time of
                   ultimate crisis -- therein lies our
                   advantage.
                           
                   We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost
                   not far from here.

      But Kirk stands -- stops him:





                 Where you came from... did I know my
                 father?


                 ... yes. You often spoke of him as your
                 inspiration for joining starfleet.

      This is amazing for Kirk -- he looks off, trying to imagine that
      life. Spock intuits what this means.


                 You should know. He proudly lived to see
                 you become captain of the Enterprise.


                 ... Captain?


                 A ship we must return you to as soon as
                 possible.



      The Enterprise STREAKS through frame in a warp blur --



      Sulu at his controls:


                 Warp three. Course one-five-one mark
                 three, the Laurentian System.

      The turbolift opens -- McCoy enters, moves to Spock:


                 You wanted to see me?


                         
                 Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk
                 is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as
                 you did, must have been difficult.


                 ... are you thanking me?


                 I'm simply acknowledging your
                 difficulties.

      We're not sure how McCoy is taking this...





                  Permission to speak freely, Sir.


                  I welcome it.


                  Do you. Okay then: are you out of your
                  Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical
                  thing? Maybe. The right one?
                  Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure
                  -- that kid doesn't know how to lose.
                  Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have
                  a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the
                  Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize
                  stallion in the stable."


                  ... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a
                  stallion must first be broken before it
                  can reach its potential.


                  My God, Man... you could at least act
                  like it was a hard decision.


                  I intended to assist in the effort to re-
                  establish communication with Starfleet.
                  However, if crew morale would be better
                  served by my roaming the halls weeping,
                  I'll gladly defer to your medical
                  expertise.

      A strong look and Spock turns away as Sarek enters the bridge.
      Spock moves to meet him. Off McCoy, fuming --



      A fucking BLIZZARD.   Kirk and Spock Prime move through the
      maddening whiteout.   Kirk yells through it:





      And Spock POINTS -- an OUTPOST -- half a mile away.



      Long tile corridor. The door at the end opens -- SNOW AND WIND
      as Kirk and Spock Prime enter. Door closes. Silence again.





                   ... hello?!

      Echo. Nothing. They head down. After a beat, a SMALL, DARK,
      ODDLY ALIEN CREATURE STEPS OUT. Eyes them curiously. This is



                   ... can I help you?


                   Are you the station chief?

      Keenser looks them over.    Then:


                   ... no.   This way.

      And they follow Keenser into a MASSIVE WAREHOUSE, filled mostly
      with junked space parts. A large, tarped SHUTTLE in the
      background. In the middle of the huge, depressing space is a
      table. And a STARFLEET OFFICER who is ASLEEP, legs kicked up,
      leaning back in a chair, a hat covering his face. Keenser taps
      the Officer's boot.


                   Hm.


                   Visitors.

      A beat -- and the Officer peers from under his hat.     A cool,
      slow burn.


                   You realize how unacceptable this is.


                   Excuse me?


                           
                   ... Fascinating.


                   What?

      Officer stands, unhappy about something. Keeser watches nearby --


                   I'm sure it's no' your fault, and I know
                   youse lads are just doing your jobs, but
                   could you no' have come a wee bit
                   sooner?!





                 Six months I've been living on nothing
                 but Starfleet Protein Nibs and the
                 promise of a real food delivery! Six
                 months, boys! It's pretty clear what's
                 going on here, isn't it? Punishment!
                 Ongoing! For something that was clearly
                 an accident!


                 You're Montgomery Scott.


                 You know him?


                 Yes, that's me -- Scotty-- you're in the
                 right place-- are there any other hard-
                 working and equally-starving Starfleet
                 officers around?


                 Me.


                 You eat nothing. A bean and you're done
                 for a week, I need food. And now you're
                 here -- so. Thank you. Where is it.


                 You are in fact the Mr. Scott who
                 postulated the theory of trans-warp
                 beaming.


                 Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking
                 about! How d'ya think I ended up here?
                 I got into a debate with my instructor on
                 the issue of Relativistic Physics as they
                 pertain to subspace travel... He seemed
                 to think that the range of transporting
                 say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few
                 hundred miles -- so I told my instructor
                 I could not only beam a bird from one
                 planet to an adjacent planet in the same
                 system -- which is no big deal anyway --
                 but if I were so inclined I could
                 actually do it with a lifeform! So I
                 tested it on Admiral Archer's prize
                 beagle. Which... was a mistake.


                 I know that dog. What happened to it?





                 I'll tell ya when it reappears.     Dunno.
                 Feel guilty.


                 What if I told you your trans-warp theory
                 was correct? That it is indeed possible
                 to beam onto a ship that is travelling at
                 warp speed. And that you only required
                 the correct field equation to
                 recrystallize dilithium?


                 I haven't been stationed here that long.
                 If such an equation had been discovered,
                 I'da heard.


                 The reason you haven't heard of it, Mr.
                 Scott... is because you haven't
                 discovered it yet.

      Kirk reacts. Scotty reacts -- is almost spooked -- sobers up a
      bit... really regards Spock Prime. Skeptical. Amused.


                 Y'from the future, are ya? Brilliant.
                 D'they still have sandwiches where you're
                 from? Piece and jam? Mince 'n tatties?
                 Cockaleekie soup?


                 What is he talking about?


                 Food.


                 Allow us access to your shuttle... and I
                 will show you what a genius you actually
                 are.

      Off Scotty, who can't help but be intrigued --





      Scotty PULLS A TARP over much of the out-of-service shuttle.


                 She's a wee bit dodgy: shield emitters
                 are totally banjaxed, along wi' a few
                 other things.




      Spock finishes speed-typing the FIELD EQUATIONS on the
      TRANSPORTER CONTROL PANEL -- amazingly fast.


                   ... rapid.   That's impressive.

      Spock Prime steps aside:


                   Your equation for achieving trans-warp
                   beaming.

      Scotty looks at the equations -- we watch his expression run the
      gamut: from confused, to dumbfounded, to quiet awe and delight:


                   Imagine that! Never occurred to me to
                   think of space as the part that's moving.


                   Point of fact: it did occur to you.
                           
                   Extrapolating Enterprise's course --


                   -- Enterprise? Had its maiden voyage
                   already, has it? Well, you must've done
                   something right to be assigned to that
                   ship, Kiddo. She's a well endowed lady --
                   love to get my hands on her ample
                   nacelles, if you'll pardon the
                   engineering parlance.


                   Now's your chance, Mr. Scott.


                   Look, even if I believed you -- where
                   you're from, what I've done-- which I
                   don't -- we're still talkin' bout
                   slingshotting aboard while she's going
                   faster than light. Without a proper
                   receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a
                   bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a
                   blindfold. On a horse.


                   I calculate no more than a four meter
                   margin of error.


                   That's all well and good unless you
                   rematerialize four meters outside the
                   ship.




      As Spock works the keyboard, an ENTERPRISE SCHEMATIC rotates:


                 Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your
                 best option: a large space and no
                 unpredictable airlocks --


                 -- you're coming with us, right?


                 No, Jim. My destiny lies along a
                 different path.


      Your destiny can wait -- he         
      won't believe me, only you can   Under no circumstances can he
      explain w--                      be made aware of my existence.
                                       You must promise me this.


                 You're telling me I can't tell you I'm
                 following your own orders? Why not?
                 What happens?


                 Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the
                 one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero,
                 you alone must take command of your ship.


                 How, over your dead body?


                 Preferably not. There is, however,
                 Starfleet Regulation 619.
                         
                 Yes. I forget what little regard you had
                 for such things. 619 states that any
                 commanding officer who is emotionally
                 compromised by the mission at hand...
                 must resign said command.


                 So I need to emotionally compromise you?


                 Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell
                 you.  I am emotionally compromised.
                         
                 What you must do... is get me to show it.

      PUSHING IN ON KIRK as this lands for him --





                 Hm.


                 Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let's
                 get this over with. he Enterprise has a
                 decent cafeteria I'm guessing.

      Scotty's on the pad.   Kirk follows, looks at Spock:


                 You know... coming back in time...
                 changing history... that's cheating.


                 A trick I learned from an old friend.

      Something strikes Kirk -- his eyes GLINT with revelation. Spock
      responds enigmatically: a silent acknowledgment of what Kirk
      must do to get the ship. He raises his hand in the legendary
      Vulcan salute:


                 Live long, and prosper.

      And Spock activates the transporter and they DEMATERIALIZE --
      the light plays off his face as he watches them vanish --



      The Enterprise SHOOTS THROUGH FRAME at warp --



      Amid the ROAR of the ship's plasma drives, PARTICLES
      rematerialize... it's KIRK, eyes wide in suspense. He looks
      down at his legs, his chest, his arms to make sure he's still in
      one piece, glances over to share his relief with Scotty... BUT
      SCOTTY ISN'T THERE. A strange BANGING -- Kirk turns: the
      BANGING is coming from a large metal TANK -- then Scotty appears
      in a TRANSLUCENT PIPE -- FREAKING OUT -- BANGING ON THE CLEAR
      METAL -- Kirk's mind races -- he looks around for a way to save
      his new friend -- just then a STRONG CURRENT IS FELT inside the
      tube -- AND SCOTTY IS YANKED AWAY, DOWN THE TUBE!


                 -- no-- shit!

      And Kirk runs after him -- down the length of the ORANGE,
      TWISTING and TURNING tubes -- SCOTTY SEEN every time he enters a
      CLEAR TUBE AREA -- then DISAPPEARING again into the ORANGE tubes
      -- and Scotty gets sucked UPWARDS -- and Kirk turns and looks --

      GIANT WATER TURBINE -- essentially? A MASSIVE FUCKING BLENDER.





                   -- no--nonono--

      And Kirk HAULS ASS to the control panel -- we see the huge
      machine -- overhead, the RELEASE VALVE under the pipe -- and
      Kirk works as fast as he can --


                   COMEONCOMEONCOMEON -- like the simulator:
                   manual control enabled, pressure seal:
                   enabled -- shutdown--

      -- but the COMPUTER SAYS:


                   Turbine Shutdown Not Allowed.






      A display on the forward console, an ALARM FLASHES --


                   Keptin, we're detecting unauthorized
                   access to a water turbine control board!

      Spock moves from Sarek to Chekov --


                   Bring up video.

      Chekov brings up TWO DOZEN SECURITY VIDEO IMAGES ON ONE SCREEN.
      Spock points to one -- it ENLARGES -- and we see KIRK AND SCOTTY
      racing through the ship -- Spock's eyes narrow -- he moves to
      the Captain's chair -- hits comm:


                   Security, this is the captain -- seal
                   engineering deck and bring me the
                   intruders in turbine station three -- set
                   phasers to stun.



      INSIDE THE TUBE, SCOTTY TUMBLES, YELLING UNDERWATER as --






      Kirk, AT THE PANEL, accesses the RELEASE VALVE CONTROL -- he
      watches Scotty disappear through a CLEAR SECTION -- Kirk times
      it -- waiting -- then he HITS THE BUTTON and Scotty DROPS
      THROUGH THE RELEASE VALVE AND SLAMS TO THE FLOOR -- hurt, wet,
      but BREATHING, deeply --


                 You all right?


                         (recovering, looking
                          around)
                 -- nice --  -- ship. Really.


                 -- let's get to the bridge--



      Kirk and wet Scotty race through the ship -- only to finally
      turn a corner and be faced with PHASERS, AIMED RIGHT AT THEM.

      But suddenly PHASERS are at their heads. Two SECURITY GUARDS --
      one, THE GUY HE GOT INTO THE FIGHT WITH AT THE BAR, YEARS AGO.


                 Come with me.     Moon Beam.

      Off Kirk -- shit --





      WOOSH -- bridge doors open -- Kirk and Scotty are ushered in by
      the Security Guards. Spock moves to them, containing his anger
      and dismay. McCoy is here as well. Spock walks right up to
      Kirk... raises his eyebrow.


                 Surprise.


                         
                 Who are you?


                 He's with me.





                   We're travelling at warp -- how did you
                   manage to get aboard this ship?

      Kirk stares at the young Spock -- a different experience now --


                   You're the genius, you figure it out.


                   As Captain of this vessel I order you to
                   answer the question.


                   Well I'm not telling.
                           
                   Captain.

      HUH.   That confounds Spock.   And Kirk is off to the races --


                   Does that frustrate you? My lack of
                   cooperation... does it make you angry?

      Spock again focuses on Scotty --


                   You are not a member of this ship's crew.
                   Under penalty of court martial, I order
                   you to explain to me how you beamed ab --


                           
                   -- Don't answer him.


                   You will answer me.

      ON SCOTTY.   Weighing all this.     Then --


                   I'd rather not take sides.

      Spock nods back to the SECURITY GUARDS, over this --


                   Escort them to the Brig.

      But before the guards can do so --


                   What is it about you, Spock? Your planet
                   was just destroyed -- your mother
                   murdered -- and you're not even upset?





                 Your presumption that these experiences
                 interfere with my abilities to command
                 this ship is inaccurate--


                 HA! And yet you said fear was necessary
                 for command. I mean -- did you see that
                 bastard's ship? Did you see what he did?


                         
                 Yes, of course I--


                 So are you afraid or aren't you?!?


                         
                 I will not... allow you to lecture me
                 about the merits of emotion.

      Kirk gets close to Spock --


                 Then why don't you stop me.

      Sarek watches, tense.   McCoy, too.   Spock blinks --


                 Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.


                 What is it like? Not to feel? Anger.
                 Or heartbreak. Or the need to stop at
                 nothing to avenge the death of the woman
                 who gave birth to you?!


                         
                 -- back away --


                         
                 You must not feel anything! It must not
                 even compute for you! You must not have
                 loved her at all--!

      -- WHAM! SPOCK HAS JUST HIT KIRK -- and Kirk goes to hit back,
      but Spock fucking DELIVERS A SERIES OF POWERFUL BLOWS --
      Security stand back as the Captain attacks...

      And Spock is now fucking CHOKING Kirk -- HE SLAMS KIRK AGAINST






                  Spock!

      And everything -- everything -- STOPS. Spock, red-faced,
      releases his grip. Kirk GULPS air and tumbles to the ground.
      Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to
      collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression
      isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion.

      Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But
      worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin.
      Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of
      dignity... looks to McCoy. Softly --


                  Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I
                  hereby relinquish my command on the
                  grounds that I have been... emotionally
                  compromised. Please note the time and
                  date in the ship's log.

      JESUS. Spock just... QUIT. And after a beat, he leaves the
      room. Sarek follows a moment later.

      The crew just stands there in stunned SILENCE.   Finally --


                  I like this ship. It's exciting.

      McCoy turns to Kirk, exasperated --


                  Congratulations, Jim. Now we've got no
                  Captain and no first officer to goddamn
                  replace him.

      ON KIRK.   The moment is upon him.


                  Yeah we do.

      ON MCCOY. The CREW -- confused. Sulu just fucking POINTS at
      Kirk and they all realize HOLY SHIT -- Pike made KIRK the First
      Officer before he left!





                  Thanks for the support!

      And Kirk moves to the captain's chair, passing Uhura:





                    I sure hope you know what you're doing.


                    ... so do I.
                            (studies chair, sits,
                             into mic)
                    Attention crew of the Enterprise.   This
                    is James Kirk...



      TRACKING WITH SPOCK, hearing the announcement as he walks
      stoically -- past CREW, hearing this --


                    Mr. Spock has resigned commission and
                    advanced me to acting Captain. I know
                    you were all expecting to regroup with
                    the fleet, but I've ordered a pursuit
                    course of the enemy ship to Earth.





      On KIRK as he ends the announcement:


                    I want all departments at battle stations
                    and ready in ten minutes. Either we're
                    going down, or they are. Kirk out.

      Clicks off.    PUSH IN ON KIRK, staring off --


                    I want some answers.

      He looks up.    Uhura is there.   Pissed off:





                   Right now. Where the hell'd you get
                   trans-warp technology?


                   -- yeah, you know that's complicated --


                   Do I look simple to you?!


                   I'm a PhD in astrophysics, I think I can
                   handle it -- how'd you get back?


                   You vant us to trust you but you von't
                   tell us the truth?


                   No. No, I won't-- hey, I'm the Captain
                   now! I don't have to tell you anything!
                   Now listen: we need to figure out a way
                   to catch up and get to Nero's ship.


                   There's not a chance. They're gonna be
                   in geosynchronous orbit around Earth in
                   ten minutes. We'll never make it.


                   Even if we could, you can't go in guns
                   blazing, not with their technology,
                   that's suicide.


                   Then we find a way to get on that ship
                   and steal the black hole device away from
                   them.


                   Well you can forget transwarp. No way to
                   predict the Narada's position from here.


                   Uhura: anything from Captain Pike?


                   No... I've been monitoring all channels.



      SPOCK stand here, staring at the place where his mother should
      have, but didn't, arrive. Sarek enters. Sees his son. They're
      alone for the first time in ages. A beat:





                   You must not punish yourself.
                           
                   Speak your mind, Spock.


                   That would be unwise.


                   What is necessary is always wise.

      Watch Spock's face.   Struggling with what's pent-up inside...


                   I feel as conflicted as I once was. As a
                   child. Have I made so little progress?


                           
                   You will always be a child of two worlds.
                   I am grateful for that. And for you.
                           
                   And not only because you are all I have
                   left of her.

      Spock looks at Sarek.   This is as close to emotion as he'll get.


                   I feel anger. For the one who took her
                   life. An anger I cannot stop.


                   I believe she would say... do not try to.
                           
                   You asked me once. Why I married your
                   mother.
                           
                   I married her because I loved her.

      Their look HOLDS -- and for Spock, a revelation...



      -- the strategy session continues in FULL SWING -- now Chekov,
      the youngest of the bunch, gets up the courage to chime in,
      incidently becoming the very first officer to say:


                   Keptin Kirk?    Excuse me, plees, could


      All eyes shift to the wonder-kid who awaits permission to speak:





                   Yes, Chekov-- you don't need to ask
                   permission to--


                   Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan,
                   I've projected that Nero will travel past
                   Saturn. If we could drop out of warp
                   behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan,
                   the magnetic distortion from the planet's
                   rings will make us invisible to Nero's
                   sensors. We could follow him to Earth by
                   staying in his blind spot.


                   What blind spot?


                   Its exhaust wake. If we adjust our
                   shield frequencies, they shouldn't detect
                   us.


                   Wait a minute-- anyone understand this
                   kid? How old are you?


                   I am seventeen, Sir, how old are you?


                   We're all old enough to shave here.


                   Doctor... Mr. Chekov is correct.

      Everyone turns, surprised: SPOCK has entered the bay --
      galvanized, full of purpose --


                   I have reviewed his telemetry. If Mr.
                   Sulu can maneuver us into position, I can
                   beam aboard Nero's ship.


                   I won't order you to do that, Mr. Spock.


                   Romulans and Vulcans share a common
                   ancestry. Our cultural similarities will
                   make it easier for me to access their
                   ship's computer to locate the device.
                           (beat; a flicker of
                            emotion)





                 Also, my mother was human. Which makes
                 Earth the only home I have left.




      The crew looks at this very courageous Vulcan with deep respect -
      - but his focus is on Uhura, whose eyes smile back at him.


                 Then I'm coming with you.


                         
                 I would cite regulation, but I know you
                 will simply ignore it.


                 See, we're getting to know each other.

      And a MOMENT -- a burgeoning friendship --



      PANNING ACROSS AN ALIEN LANDSCAPE... and even though it's in
      shadow, you start to recognize it as THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.
      OUR POV ascends now to see:



      And we move past it, along the orbit of the moon, cresting the
      horizon to see EARTH -- AND NERO'S SHIP HOVERING ABOVE IT.



      CLOSE ON NERO -- his face illuminated on the DARKENED BRIDGE of
      the Narada by SOFT BLUE LIGHT. Light radiated by EARTH. A
      BEAUTIFUL HOLOGRAM before him. He doesn't notice behind him, as
      those BLADES from his STAFF APPEAR BEHIND HIS NECK. Nero
      tenses, only now sensing this unforeseen danger: AYEL HOLDS THE
      WEAPON. Strong. Tough. But under it all... terrified.


                 The men and I have discussed this. What
                 we are about to do.
                         
                 We have to turn the ship around. We can
                 save our home.

      Nero turns slowly and deliberately -- Ayel tenses:


                 Stop.

      Nero now faces Ayel, blades at his throat -- Ayel growing more
      nervous as he faces his master. The surrounding crew stare on,
      frozen in the moment, only slightly confirming their makeshift
      mutiny with scared looks.





                   We can go back. That's what we want. We
                   have taken our vengeance on Vulcan. No
                   more. We want to go home now.

      Nero considers this... nods gently.


                   There is no need, Ayel.   To threaten me.
                           
                   I understand.

      Ayel is massively relieved.     Nero gently reaches out, holds the
      staff .     He deactivates it -- the blades
      instantly RETRACT.


                   I understand.    But you are wrong.

      And just as Ayel realizes he's fucked, Nero somehow activates
      the staff in a way we have not seen -- AND THE BLADES APPEAR ON


      TO THE FLOOR, DEAD! Nero's hard face turns to the rest of his
      crew.


                   We will return to Romulus when the
                   Federation lies in ruins and not a moment
                   before. When those who watched our
                   people burn at last understand our pain,
                   our loss. I refuse to return as a slave!
                   We will return as conquerors!

      ON THE FACES OF THE MEN, SUBMITTING TO HIS WILL, our MUSIC
      BUILDING -- and then, his eyes on Earth like a fucking LION eyes
      a gazelle--


                   Deploy the drill.



      THE DRILL BAY DOORS open as they LOWER THE PLASMA DRILL.



      No sign of Kirk and Spock.     Sulu's in the captain's chair.
      Chekov at helm.


                   Mr. Chekov, transfer manual control to
                   the Captain's chair.





                   Aye.
                           
                   I've projected the parabolic course you
                   must follow. If you deviate by so much
                   as a meter, we will be detected.


                   Give me one quarter impulse burst for
                   five seconds and I'll do the rest with
                   thrusters. On my mark. Three... two...
                   one... fire.



      The impulse engines SURGE, shutting off as the ship slips out
      from behind the moon and into open space --



      Sulu makes rapid-fire thruster combinations to stay on track --
      a stealthy ballet of incredible dexterity. THE NARADA appears
      over the horizon in geosynchronous orbit, passing underneath the
      Enterprise as they arc in behind it.


                   All stop in three... two... one...



      The small Enterprise pulls into position behind the massive
      Narada's BLIND SPOT and comes to a gentle stop. Tension --




                   Transporter Room. We're in stable
                   geosynchronous orbit behind the Narada.


                           
                   No sign they've detected us --



      KIRK and SPOCK ready themselves for transport. STRAP ON UTILITY
      BELTS: COM-SETS, TRICORDERS, and of course, PHASERS --


                           
                   Well done, Mr. Sulu.





                   Whatever happens Mr. Sulu, if you feel
                   you have a tactical advantage fire on
                   that ship. Even if we're still aboard.
                   It's an order.


                   Yessir.   Good luck.

      Spock turns to Uhura, who hands him a small TRANSLATOR DEVICE:


                   We'll be monitoring your frequency...

      Uhura gives the translator to Spock -- AND HE KISSES UHURA.


                   Thank you, Nyota.

      They part, revealing KIRK'S SHOCKED FACE. Uhura walks off,
      leaving the two men -- Kirk looking stunned at Spock.


                   Her first name is...


                   I have no comment on the matter.

      Kirk still stunned as Scotty moves to transporter control.


                   If there's any common sense to their ship
                   design, I'll be puttin' ya in a cargo
                   bay, shouldn't be a soul in sight.



      - The moment of truth.


                   Energize.

      Scotty hits the transport and Kirk and Spock DISAPPEAR --



      Kirk and Spock MATERIALIZE in the cargo bay... to find
      themselves suddenly smack-dab in the middle of SIX ROMULAN
      GUARDS working at cargo consoles!!




      For a split second they're as shocked as Kirk and Spock, until
      they ATTACK -- Kirk immediately engages the closest Romulan,
      struggles -- but Spock's a machine: his palm snaps up CRACKING a
      nose -- SLAMS a head against the wall -- as battle-ready as the
      Romulans are, it's like trying to catch a GHOST, Kirk finally
      knocks his one opponent unconscious, and turns to see it's ALL



                           
                   Mine had a gun.


                   I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of
                   Suus Mahna.

      Kirk and Spock move to a still conscious Romulan as he struggles
      to get up. Spock reaches for the fallen Romulan's temples.


                   I am unable to meld with these Romulans --
                   there are subtle differences in their
                   physiology I did not anticipate --


      -- punch him in the face --
      make him talk! Suus Mahna his       -- Suss Mahna is only intended
      ass!                                for self-defense, he's no
                                          longer a threat --
      -- then pretend it's a threat -
      - I'm your captain, that's an
      order!

      Spock PUNCHES the Romulan HARD -- and via Uhura's comlink
      translator, speaks in SUBTITLED ROMULAN:


                   What is your computer access code?

      The guard SPITS green blood at Spock, who PUNCHES him again --








                   The plasma drill is repaired and fully
                   deployed.


                   Good.   Let's begin.










      The plasma beam SLAMS INTO SAN FRANCISCO BAY -- massive




      Cadets RUN to see the horrific sight of the plasma beam --



      As Uhura returns to the bridge, everyone's stations go DARK --
      STATIC on screens --


                 They've activated the drill --


                 Communications and transporter
                 inoperative --


                 They're on their own now.



      A ROTATING SHIP SCHEMATIC -- Spock typing at a console,
      searching -- accesses two inter-cam windows: on one, SPOCK
      PRIME'S SHIP, THE JELLYFISH -- in a lower containment hold -- on
      the other: PIKE, unclear if he's dead or alive.


                 What you refer to as the "Red Matter
                 Device" is in the main hangar -- and I've
                 located Captain Pike.


                 Is he alive?


                 Unknown.


                 Let's move.

      They cover each other with phasers as they move down the hall --






      Captain Pike's shuttle and the Jellyfish sit parked among the
      equipment. Kirk and Spock stealthily board the Jellyfish --



      Kirk hits a console, a familiar voice comes to life:


                 Voice print and face recognition analysis
                 enabled.


                 Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone.


                 Which may be problematic, as I am
                 unfamiliar with this ship's design.

      THE LASER GRID RESPONDS TO SPOCK'S VOICE, scans his features for



                 Welcome back, Ambassador Spock.


                          
                 Wow.   That's weird.

      He looks to Kirk in surprise -- Spock's eyes fix with sudden
      understanding. Ambassador Spock... of course... suddenly all
      the pieces start coming together...


                 Computer: what is your manufacturing
                 origin?


                 Stardate 2397, commissioned by the Vulcan
                 Science Academy.

      Spock looks at Kirk, a touch upset:


                 It appears you've been keeping rather
                 important information from me.


                 Just trust me.      Can ya do that?

      Spock weigh his options.     Trust.   Finally:





                    I'll get Pike.

      Kirk exits --



      Kirk moves through various areas of the ship --



      Spock works the control -- fires up the craft --



      LIGHTS COME ON -- he starts it up -- the ship begins to RISE --
      and with the enormous JELLYFISH now OPERATING -- FLOATING IN THE
      HANGAR, Spock turns the ship and FIRES AT THE MASSIVE IRIS DOOR,

      as --



      The ship SHUDDERS from within -- ALARMS --


                    Primary core rupture, warp engines off-
                    line!





                    Someone has detonated weapons in the main
                    hangar!




                    Restore power!     Engage auxiliary systems!


















      As the bridge crew fights to regain control:


                  The drill's been severed!


                  Ambassador Spock's ship has been stolen
                  as is heading out of the solar system!




      A beat -- the Romulan Commander looks up from his console:


                          
                  ... Spock.

      OFF Nero's fucking mega rage --



      The Narada turns -- accelerates in pursuit of the Jellyfish and
      AWAY FROM EARTH -- and now we're back to the imagery of the
      first few moments of the movie -- THE NARADA GAINING ON THE





                          
                  Open a channel --


                  Channel Open --


                  Spock -- I should've killed you when I
                  had the chance.






                  Under authority granted me by the Europa
                  convention, I'm confiscating this
                  illegally obtained ship and order you to
                  surrender your vessel. No terms. No
                  deals.

      And Nero?   Just grins in perfect contentment...





                   You can't cheat me again, Spock. I know
                   you better than you know yourself.


                   Last warning: unconditional surrender or
                   you will be destroyed.


                           
                   Fire at will.


                   Sir-- if you ignite the red matter, the--


                   I want Spock dead!    Fire!

      Nero hurries to the controls -- operates them himself and --



      -- FIRE IT DOES -- TORPEDOES BLAST FROM THE HOLD and to the
      jellyfish, which performs evasive maneuvers -- the torpedoes
      EXPLODE as --



      Kirk moves through shadow into an airlock shaft, starts climbing
      ladder rungs --



      The JELLYFISH TILTS, earth receding far behind it -- Spock veers
      to avoid being blown apart -- Nero's ship gaining -- firing --



      Kirk moves through the space -- into the TORTURE ROOM, where he
      finds PIKE, CLOSE TO DEATH -- Kirk begins unfastening his binds.
      Pike sees him through his fog -- amazed --


                   ... Kirk?


                   Came back, Sir. Just like you ordered.

      Kirk helps LIFT HIM -- but what he DOESN'T SEE are the FOUR
      GUARDS entering with weapons --




      But PIKE, God bless him, does: summoning his last ounce of
      strength, he manages to UNHOLSTER KIRK'S PHASER AND BLASTS THE
      FOUR GUARDS OUT OF EXISTENCE! Safe, he SLUMPS, dropping the
      phaser --



      The Narada FIRES again, TEARING a gash in the Jellyfish's side.



      An array EXPLODES --


                   ... you should've fled, Spock. Sight
                   target, standby torpedoes... FIRE!


                   Warning: Shields off-line.

      On Spock -- bad as things are, they just got worse -- his mind
      SPINS until:


                   Computer, prepare self destruct sequence.



      And the Jellyfish TURNS -- a new course RIGHT FOR THE NARADA --



      CLOSE ON SPOCK, bravely facing certain death -- on a collision
      course with the Narada -- looks like he's gonna sacrifice
      himself -- and we assume he'll pull away at the last second, of
      course he will, but he DOESN'T:











      As the ship's ROCKED HARD, Nero sees the black hole BUILDING
      through the cockpit window:

















      IT'S A RUSH, CRAZY, TENSE AS HELL --Uhura, McCoy, a MED TEAM and
      ND OFFICERS race in as Scotty finishes receiving incoming
      signals:




                         
                 Nice timing, Lieutenant --


                 Never beamed two targets from two places
                 onto the same pad before! That was
                 pretty good!

      Kirk transfers Pike to McCoy, who urgently SCANS Pike and barks
      to a MED-TECH:


                 -- we're gonna need gastric stimulators,
                 let's prep him for surgery, now!



      Everyone's HURLED off their feet -- consoles fry -- FIRE --


                 Nero-- it's the Enterprise!







      Nero's eyes come UNHINGED --



      WHOOSH: KIRK and SPOCK race back onto the bridge --


                 Keptin! The enemy ship is losing power--
                 its shields are down!





                   Hail them -- now!

      NERO appears on screen from the Narada bridge -- the Narada's on
      its last legs -- a beat before Nero TURNS, realizing Kirk's
      fucking GRINNING at him from the screen:


                   This is Captain James T. Kirk of the
                   U.S.S. Enterprise -- your ship is
                   compromised -- too close to the
                   singularity to survive without assistance
                   -- which we are willing to provide.


                           
                   Captain -- what are you doing?


                           
                   We show them compassion-- it may be the
                   only way to earn peace with Romulus.
                   It's logic, Spock! I thought you'd like
                   that.


                   No, not really, not this time.


                   I would rather suffer the death of
                   Romulus a thousand times than accept
                   assistance from you.


                   You got it.
                           
                   Lock phasers! Fire everything we've got!











                   Kirk to Engineering: get us out of here,
                   Scotty!


                   -- you bet yer ass, Captain --






      The walls are RIPPING AWAY, PYLONS pull free from their
      moorings, into the ever-expanding sphere -- NERO -- IN THE



                 Forgive me... Romulus...






      Leaving only the Enterprise -- its nacelles FLARE as the ship
      tries to make the quantum leap -- BUT: the black hole's now a
      TITANIC WHIRLPOOL so insanely strong that the Enterprise is held
      in place by the gravity well even at warp! IT SHAKES INTO A
      BLUR, trying to cut loose but it CAN'T --


















      Scotty SHOUTS BACK into the com against the SCREAMING DRIVE:









                         










      Scotty SLAMS the activation panel and we see the WARP CORE eject
      down a tube, like an INSTANT PNEUMATIC RELEASE --













      Everyone white-knuckles their seats as the blast DISSIPATES...
      and our crew sits, wide-eyed, trembling... finally, truly safe.



      Back home.



      Spock is seen in a medical office with Pike, who lies in bed,
      recovering -- McCoy monitors him - Spock exits -- walks through
      the corridor -- sees a VULCAN in silhouette, staring out at the
      Academy. Sarek. Spock moves to him -- says quietly:


                   Father...?

      Sarek turns -- but IT ISN'T SAREK.   IT'S SPOCK PRIME.     Who says:


                   I am not... our father.

      An incredible beat, our two Spocks in eye lock... both minds
      processing conversational possibilities at an incredible rate...
      surreal extensions of each other, separate but connected...


                   ... Fascinating.


                   There are so few Vulcans left.    We cannot
                   afford to ignore each other.

      Young Spock's eyes flicker in puzzlement...


                   Then why did you send Kirk aboard when
                   you alone could've explained the truth?





                           
                   Because you needed each other. Opposing
                   yet complimentary opposites. It was that
                   balance between us -- I should say
                   you and Kirk -- that often made the
                   impossible, possible.


                   ... it was a test?


                           
                   I'm in no position to pass judgment...
                   my actions have robbed you of much. I
                   could not also deprive you the revelation
                   of all you can accomplish together... of
                   a friendship that will define you both in
                   ways you cannot yet realize.

      There is, to young Spock's surprise, vulnerability in that.


                   How did you persuade him to keep your
                   secret?


                   I inferred universe-ending paradoxes
                   would ensue should he break his promise.


                   You lied.


                   I implied.


                   A gamble...


                   An act of faith. One I hope you'll
                   repeat in the future.

      Young Spock considers an enduring friendship between him and
      Kirk... for the first time, understanding it. But --


                   The future's not what it used to be... in
                   the face of extinction, it's only logical
                   I resign my Starfleet commission and help
                   rebuild our race.





                 And yet, you are in a unique position...
                 you can be in two places at once.





                         
                 I urge you to remain in Starfleet: I've
                 already located a suitable planet on
                 which to establish a Vulcan colony, and
                 assist in the foundation of a new science
                 academy.

      Young Spock takes that in, resolute...


                 My future cannot be determined by your
                 past. We are one, but not the same.


                 Then I ask that you do yourself a favor.
                 Put away logic. Do what feels right.
                 The world you've inherited lives in the
                 shadow of incalculable devastation... but
                 there's no reason you must face it alone.

      Spock Prime moves to the door, stops.    Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:


                 As my customary farewell would appear
                 oddly self serving, I will simply say...
                 good luck.

      Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
      Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
      jumble of thoughts... and our MUSIC BUILDS...



      As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
      man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
      SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
      just passed him is... oddly familiar.



      MUSIC STILL BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at
      dock, UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at
      attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of
      them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud --
      and we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, a man. The
      ACADEMY PRESIDENT stands at a podium:


                 This assembly calls Captain James
                 Tiberius Kirk...




      Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
      past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
      absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:


                   Your inspirational valor and supreme
                   dedication to your comrades are in
                   keeping with the highest traditions of
                   service and reflect utmost credit to
                   yourself, your crew, and the Federation.
                   For your... unique solution to the
                   Kobayashi Maru, it's my honor to award
                   you with a commendation for original
                   thinking.

      He opens a BOX -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:


                   By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
                   directed to report to Commanding Officer,
                   USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.

      Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
      ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
      but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE:


                   I relieve you, Sir.


                   I am relieved. Congratulations, Captain.

      Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest.


                   Thank you, Sir.

      Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE. As Kirk
      rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK
      of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words.
      He turns and leaves them to it... and our MUSIC SWELLS as --



      The turbolift WHOOSHES open and in walks Kirk -- to every fan's
      delight, wearing his iconic GOLD SHIRT. All around him, our
      crew -- young and fresh-faced but no longer children -- in
      charge of the greatest starship ever built:





                   Maneuvering thrusters and impulse engines
                   at your command, Sir.


                   Weapons systems and shields on standby.


                   Dock control reports ready.    Yard Command
                   signalling clear.


                   Scotty how are we?


                   Dilithium chamber at maximum efficiency,
                   Captain.


                           
                   Same ship, different day.

      And Kirk pauses. His eyes go over to the empty science console
      with a sense of incompleteness. In fact, everyone on the bridge
      feels it. A bitter truth they'll have to accept.


                   Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus--

      WHOOSH: the turbolift door opens.      SPOCK!!!   Wearing his BLUE
      UNIFORM. Our hearts soar --


                   Permission to come aboard, Captain.


                   ... Permission granted.


                   As you have yet to select a first
                   officer, respectfully, I would like to
                   submit my candidacy. Should you desire,
                   I can provide character references.

      Kirk nearly laughs. Spock's eyebrow goes up. Something passes
      between them... it carries acceptance, and trust...


                   It would be my honor, Commander.
                   Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.     Take us
                   out.


                   Aye, Captain.




      As the ship maneuvers out of dry dock, Spock takes his place
      next to Kirk. Gold and blue, side by side.



      And the ship crests the drydock portal, drifting into space...
      blessed one last time by the voice of our Vulcan hero:


                  Space... the final frontier. These are
                  the continuing voyages of the Starship
                  Enterprise. Her ongoing mission... to
                  explore strange new worlds... to seek out
                  new life forms, and new civilizations...
                  To boldly go, where no one has gone...
                  before...

      The TREK THEME SOARS as the Enterprise warps off into a universe
      of infinite possibilities...




















                   ... oh my God...
                           
                   A lightning storm... then this...
                           
                   Signal all departments: first contact
                   protocols. Looks like we have someone
                   new on the block. All Stop.


                   All stations, FC-3 procedures
                   initiated..."


                   Broadcasting universal greeting on all
                   open frequencies.


                   Sir, should we initiate an active scan?


                   That could be seen as an act of
                   provocation -- all readings passive--

      Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:


                   EM sensors in passive sweep...


                   Power signature detected -- level's
                   increasing.

      Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --




      Sir, I have a reading --
      they've locked weapons on us!     -- Red alert!   Arm weapons!

      ALARMS BLARE -- LIGHTS GO RED as --






The Narada FIRES a TORPEDO -- IT HEADS FOR THE KELVIN -- then
SEPARATES, fracturing into a multi-hit projectile --



Officers SCRAMBLE, brace for impact --




Torpedo locked on us at 320
degrees, mark two -- incoming      -- Evasive pattern Delta-5!
fast!


           Redirecting auxiliary power to forward
           shields!"


           Aft torpedo tubes are hot!



A direct hit SMASHES several decks along the DISH of the ship --



Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor --
then, on his chair com:


           Damage report!

INTERCUT with:



Moving with the Kelvin's CHIEF ENGINEER:


           Diagnostic's back online -- rerouting to
           auxiliary console.


           Power grid junctions C-7 and E-3 are
           out...


           Dispatch repair teams to deck 4.





             Our shields did nothing, Sir! Never seen
             anything like it! Weapons off-line!
             Main power at 38 percent!










           Then I ask that you do yourself a
           favor... put away logic, and do what
           feels right. The world you've inherited
           lives in the shadow of incalculable
           devastation... but there's no reason you
           must face it alone.

And from around his neck, he removes the PENDANT that until now,
we've only caught glimpses of. Places it on the table beside
his younger self. The feeling in his eyes is profound...


           This was a gift to me.   Representing...
           a dream. One we were unable to fulfill.
                   
           The way you can now.

And moves to the door.    Stops.   Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:


           As my customary farewell would appear
           oddly self serving, I will simply say...
           good luck.

Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.
Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a
jumble of thoughts. Looks to the pendant... and realizes it's a
HOLO-EMITTER. After considering a beat, he hits an activation
button and a MOVING HOLOGRAPHIC MESSAGE materializes before him:

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK. WILLIAM SHATNER.      As always, brash, wry,
confident -- and SINGING:


           Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to
           you...
                   
           I know I know, it's illogical to
           celebrate something you had nothing to do
           with, but I haven't had the chance to
           congratulate you on your appointment to
           the ambassadorship so I thought I'd seize
           the occasion... Bravo, Spock -- they tell
           me your first mission may take you away
           for awhile, so I'll be the first to wish
           you luck... and to say...
                   
           I miss you, old friend.




... and we're PUSHING IN on Young Spock, taking in the image of
Kirk's future self, the message, but above all -- the clear,
unquestionable friendship these two men had...



As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a
man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's
SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's
just passed him is... oddly familiar.


           I suppose I'd always imagined us...
           outgrowing Starfleet together. Watching
           life swing us into our Emeritus years...



MUSIC BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at dock,
UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at
attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of
them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud:


           I look around at the new cadets now and
           can't help thinking... has it really been
           so long? Wasn't it only yesterday we
           stepped onto the Enterprise as boys?
           That I had to prove to the crew I
           deserved command... and their respect?

And we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, proud. A man.
And to every fan's delight, finally wearing his YELLOW SHIRT.
The FEDERATION COMMANDANT stands at a podium:


           This assembly calls Captain James
           Tiberius Kirk...

Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --
past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably
absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:


           Your inspirational valor and supreme
           dedication to your comrades are in
           keeping with the highest traditions of
           service and reflect utmost credit to
           yourself, your crew, and the Federation.
           By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby
           directed to report to Commanding Officer,
           USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.




Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an
ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --
but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE
each other:


             I relieve you, Sir.


             ... I am relieved.

He opens a BOX in his lap -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:


             And as Fleet Admiral, for your... unique
             solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my
             honor to award you with a commendation
             for original thinking.

Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest...


                     
             Congratulations, Captain.


             Thank you, Sir.

Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE.    OUR
MUSIC SOARS. Bones leans in to Sulu, rolling his eyes:


             ... Same ship, different day.

As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to
the BACK of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond
words. He turns and leaves them to it... as he goes...


             I know what you'd say -- `It's their turn
             now, Jim...' And of course you're
             right... but it got me thinking:



Our montage comes full circle as we END on Kirk's transmission:


             Who's to say we can't go one more round?
             By the last tally, only twenty five
             percent of the galaxy's been chartered...
             I'd call that negligent. Criminal even --
             an invitation.





             You once said being a starship captain
             was my first, best destiny... if that's
             true, then yours is to be by my side. If
             there's any true logic to the universe...
             we'll end up on that bridge again
             someday.

Stops, grins.   Because this is the part he needs to say most...


             Admit it, Spock. For people like us, the
             journey itself... is home.

Young Spock's face.   Lost in feelings that flood through him.

           This is highly improbable.


           It seems we are under attack.


           I await my fate with a clear consciences.


           An end is just a beginning.




           All com channels open.


           We have clearance from Starfleet.

           Transporter deck is operational.


           Shields at one-hundred percent and
           stable.


           Engineering reports warp core is stable.


           Warp propulsion system is at maximum

           Warp drive is off line, we are on impulse
           only, repeat, impulse only.


           Sir, we've been detected -- Romulan
           vessel is turning about.
