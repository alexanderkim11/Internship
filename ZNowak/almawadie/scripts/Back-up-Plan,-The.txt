                                          August 30th, 2007



We're not exactly sure where we are. And we're not exactly
sure who's talking. All we know is that we are looking at a
foot. One bare foot with chipped red polish.


          I can't believe I didn't get a
          pedicure for this. How
          embarrassing. Look at that...

The toes open and then curl down as if trying to hide.


          What's wrong with me? If I were
          with a real guy doing this, I
          would've gotten a pedicure. And a
          wax. I'm pathetic.

The CAMERA PANS to the other foot, which is also chipped.


          Fuck, that one's even worse. And
          when did my toes get so fat? No
          wonder I'm alone. I'm a fat-toed
          animal.

Zoe lets out a sigh.    She speaks out-loud now.


          Sorry I didn't get a pedicure.


          What?

DR. HARRIS  looks up from between Zoe's
knees, the light on his head flashing right in Zoe's eyes.


          My toes...sorry.


          I'm not looking at your toes.


          Right.   Duh.

Dr. Harris stands and takes off his gloves.



          All done.




          That's it?

And now, for the first time, we see ZOE. Despite the paper
gown and worried look on her face, she's a late-30-something,
girl-next-door type. She could be your best friend.


          I'll elevate your legs for ten
          minutes and then you're good to go.

He sets a kitchen timer and then pushes a button to raise her
legs. We hear the loud TICK TOCK of the timer.


          This is the first time I've heard
          that ticking clock sound and it
          doesn't freak me out.


          Good.   Just relax.


          I can't, I'm totally freaking out.


          Everything's going to be great. I
          have a feeling you and...
              
          Number CRM-101404 are going to make
          beautiful babies together.

Zoe smiles.   Maybe he's right.   Yeah...of course he's right.


          Number CRM-101404? Are you high?






BOBBY, 39  gay and gorgeous, opens a file
and points to a piece of paper.


          Says here he has red hair and
          freckles.


          And glasses, too.


          And why are we picking him?




          Because he's honest.


          He's ugly.

Zoe points to a stack of potential donors.


          You think they're all telling the
          truth? If they're so smart and
          good looking, why are they beating
          off into a cup?


          Have you ever fucked a guy with red
          hair and freckles?


          No, and I won't have to.


          But what about your kid? No one's
          going to want to fuck your kid.
              
          That came out wrong.


          Yeah...it's a good thing you're not
          going to be the father.






Bobby spits out a mouthful of Sauvignon Blanc.


          What?    I can't be the father!


          Come on, we don't have to have sex.


          Oh, Jesus, I didn't even think
          about that. Rewind, rewind,
          rewind...


          You're one of my best friends.
          Don't you want to help me?




          Yeah, but...that's too much. I'll
          walk your dog, tell you when you
          look fat, be honest about your
          eyebrows...


          Just a few sperm. Big deal. You
          waste billions of them every night.


          You know I flee at the slightest
          chance of intimacy. Do you see
          these bags under my eyes? Ricardo
          slept over last night, and he
          wanted to hold me. I actually had
          to fake a seizure.


          Forget it.     Forget the whole thing.

Zoe sighs and puts her head in her hands.


          Forget the whole thing.    It's just
          a phase...






Zoe and MONA, Zoe's age but looks much older, sit at the
kitchen table.


          You don't want kids.    Trust me.


          Easy for you to say.    You have
          four.


          Yeah, and it's awful.

Three CHILDREN run through the kitchen yelling and screaming.
A beat later, a TODDLER runs after them crying.


          They've ruined my life.


          Come on...




          Have you seen my vagina?

Zoe shakes her head.


          Do you want to?

Zoe shakes her head again.


          I would do that for you. To prove
          to you that you don't want to have
          kids, I will show you my vagina.


          I don't want to see your vagina.    I
          want a baby. My own baby.


          Is it possible you're just a little
          lonely? You know, you haven't met
          the right guy and--


          It's not about a guy. I don't need
          a guy. I don't even think I want a
          guy at this point. I've dated a
          hundred guys in the last five
          years, and not one of them is even
          close to being the one. How long
          am I supposed to wait?


          You never know. He could be right
          around the corner.


          Well, then he's late. And I hate
          people who are late. And what if
          he's not right around the corner?
          What if he's miles away?

Zoe shakes her head.   She becomes very serious.


          I want to have a baby. And time is
          running out. I hear a clock
          ticking every time I close my eyes.
          I need it to stop.

We hear a loud DING.





Zoe opens her eyes. We're back in the exam room.      She looks
at the timer, which just hit zero. She smiles.


          Ding.

Then a tear forms in the corner of her eye. She wipes it
away. She wipes a tear from the other eye. Happy tears.
Then she looks at her legs high above her on the table.


          How the fuck am I supposed to get
          down from here?




Zoe walks down the hall with her legs pressed firmly
together, moving only from the knees down. Dr. Harris
passes.


          You don't have to walk like that.


          Oh.   Okay.

Zoe separates her legs an inch.     And then closes them.


          Should we hug? We might have just
          made a baby together.




Zoe walks through the waiting room with her legs still
pressed together. She sees two PREGNANT WOMAN, touches her
own stomach and smiles. She finally feels part of this
exclusive baby club.


          Hi.


          Hi.




Zoe enters the elevator where there is a WOMAN holding a
BABY. Zoe smiles at them. Another member of the club...




          Hi.


          Hi.

The elevator descends. Zoe continues to stare at the baby
with a big smile. She stares for an uncomfortably long time.


          You're starting to freak me out.


          Sorry.

Zoe looks down.    After a beat, she sneaks another look.


          Stop it.




It's POURING outside. The kind of rain that turns umbrellas
inside out. NEW YORKERS run for cover with newspapers over
their heads.

Despite the rain, Zoe skips out of the building with her
hands in the air and twirls around. Realizing that she's
spread her legs too far apart, she snaps them back together.

A WOMAN pushing a baby stroller covered in plastic runs by.


          Hi!

Zoe looks uptown for a cab. Nope. Nothing. She starts to
walk, still keeping her legs firmly pressed together. She
rounds the corner towards the subway station and then,
miraculously, spies a cab.


          Taxi!

She runs  across the street.




Zoe closes the door behind her.


          Hallelujah!



As soon as the word comes out of her mouth, she notices
someone entering the cab from the other side.

This is STAN, early 40s, but looks more like a college kid --
faded jeans, t-shirt, cute, messy hair.


          Uh...excuse me. This is my cab.


          You own it?


          No, but I'm about to rent it.


          Actually, if we're being technical,
          you kind of stole it.


          I don't think so.


          If you see someone about to get in
          a cab, you can't just run in from
          the other side and say it's yours.


          I didn't see you.


          I saw you see me.


              
          Sir, who saw you first?

The CABBIE picks up his paper and starts to read.


          Maybe you're not from around here,
          but there's a code. It's like war,
          even though it's brutal and bloody,
          there are still certain rules we--


          Fine.   Forget it.   I'll get out.

Zoe grabs the door handle and then turns back.


          But not because you're right, but
          because I am in a terrific mood,
          and you are ruining it.




          No.   I'll get out.

They each get out.




Zoe and Stan stand on opposite sides of the taxi in the
POURING RAIN. Zoe crosses her arms.


          Now what?


          I don't know. You tell me.

That question is answered by the cabbie, who now peels out.


          What? Where's he going?!
              
          Come back!

They both stand there with a taxi's width between them.


          Well, that was stupid. Why'd you
          get out, you, stupid-head?


          You said you were in a great mood
          and I was ruining it. I felt bad.
              
          Did you just call me stupid-head?

Zoe storms off with her little steps.




Stan and Zoe each swipe their Metrocards at the same time.

They enter the subway platform which is jam packed with all
the other NEW YORKERS who are shit-out-of-luck in the cab
department. Rain droplets drip from the ceiling above.


          Oh, man...


          How's your great mood now?





A packed subway car. Zoe and Stan are back-to-back, pushed
together by the crowd. Zoe tries to read her paper.


          How `bout now?


          Please stop talking to me.




Zoe and Stan walk up the stairs a few feet apart from each
other. Zoe does her best to ignore the obvious.


          So, why are you in such a good mood
          anyway?

They reach the top of the stairs. The rain has stopped, and
the sun is just starting to peek through. Everything is wet
and has a magical quality.


          Not that it's any of your business,
          but...good things are happening to
          me.

Stan is moved by this.   What a thing to say.


          That's nice. I hope it continues.


          Thanks. Well, have a nice life.
          Try not to steal any more cabs.


          You do the same.

They nod and separate.




Hudson Pets is a small but quaint West Village pet store
filled with dogs, cats and a few rabbits.

Zoe enters. Her dog, NUTS, a raggedy, pug-like dog with hind
legs in a WHEELCHAIR, bounds/wheels towards her, barking.




          Hey, Nutsy. How's it going?

She gives Nuts a good scratch. JALISA, mid-30s, Latina
hottie, and Bobby run from the back.


          Oh, my God, you're glowing.
              
          She's glowing, right?


          Glowing.   Tell us everything.


          Everything.


          There's not much to tell.


          You just got shot up with a wad of
          red-headed-freckle sperm. There's
          something to tell.


          He had red hair and freckles?


          I tried to talk her out of it.


          Why'd you do that, Mami?


              
          I know, right?


          Red pubes.     Eek...


          I'm never going to see his pubes!


          You'll see your kid's pubes.


          I doubt it.


          But you'll know they're there.




          What is wrong with you?


          So, what happened?    Come on...


          I lay down, put my feet up, five
          minutes later it was over. I
          barely felt a thing.


          Sounds like Ricardo.


          Tell me about it, Papi.

Bobby and Jalisa high five.    Bobby then turns to Zoe.


          So...what happens now?


          Now, we wait.


          That's no fun, I want to know if
          I'm going to be a fairy godmother.


          We'll just have to wait and see.

Zoe smiles and heads for the back.




The lights in the pet store go dark.   Moments later, Zoe,
Bobby, Jalisa and Nuts exit.


          Come on, Zoe, one drink. You can
          have an O'Dhouls or something.


          We'll go to the piano bar and get
          Bobby to sing some Ace of Base.


          Forget it, she's not coming. I can
          tell by the dull look on her face.


          Love you.



They all hug.   Bobby and Jalisa walk away arm-in-arm,
singing.


          I saw the sign and it opened up my
          eyes, I saw the sign...

Zoe turns to lock up.   While her back is turned, Stan appears
from the shadows.


          Hi.


          Aahhh!

Zoe screams and drops the keys. Nuts, overexcited by Zoe's
reaction, starts to run/wheel in circles and then tips over.


          You scared the hell out of me!


          Oh, wow.   Is he...okay?

Nuts is still on the ground, his wheels spinning.   Zoe sets
him upright.


          What are you doing here?


          I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare
          you. Or hurt your dog. Don't
          worry, I'm not a stalker.


          How'd you know I worked here?


          I followed you after the subway.
              
          That sounds a little stalkery, huh?


          Yeah.


          I just really wanted to see you
          again. Almost like I had to see
          you again. Can I walk you home?
              
          Is it me or does everything I say
          make me sound more like a stalker?



Zoe allows a small smile.


          Can I just give you my card? Here.
          Take my card. I'm not a freak.
          Really. I sell cheese.

This hangs out there for a beat.


          Cheese?


          Yeah. My family has a goat farm.
          We make cheese. You like cheese?


          I guess. I've never really thought
          about it.


          Little Goat. Maybe you've seen us
          at the Farmer's market? Come by
          sometime and you can taste my
          cheese.
              
          Okay, I'm going to go. This has
          not gone as planned.

Stan smiles meekly and then turns to go.


          Bye.

Stan lifts his hand to wave but doesn't even turn around.
Clearly, he feels like an idiot. Zoe watches him go.




Establishing shot of a cute brownstone with window boxes and
a front stoop. We TILT UP to the third floor window.




Zoe is asleep with the morning sun on her face. Nuts is
beside her, his two little, lame legs hanging off the pillow.
Zoe opens her eyes.

After a beat, she gets up and walks to the mirror. She lifts
up her pajama top and looks at her stomach, sticking it out
as far as it will go. It's flat as a board.





Seven WOMEN sit around the cramped living room of this small,
East Village apartment. At least one woman is nursing a
child that looks entirely too old to still be nursing.

This is the SINGLE MOTHERS BY CHOICE Support Group. CAROL,
40's, short hair, tank top and no bra, is the leader.


          Everyone, please say hello to Zoe.


          Hi, Zoe.


          Welcome to Single Mother's By
          Choice. As the name suggests, we
          are all single mothers by choice.
          Some of us have adopted, some
          conceived with a donor, every story
          is different, but with the same
          common denominator. We wanted to
          have a child, and we didn't need a
          partner to make it happen.

The women smile and nod. They are a proud, no-nonsense,
somewhat masculine bunch. LORI, pregnant with a buzz cut,
turns to Zoe.


          Are you a doer or a tryer?


          Excuse me?


          Are you already a single mother or
          are you trying to become one?


          Oh, I guess I'm trying. I was just
          inseminated a few days ago.
              
          Inseminated...makes me feel like a
          cow or something.


          Well, when we don't have partners
          with penises, we do what we've got
          to do, right?
              
          So, tell us a little bit about
          yourself.




          Okay. Let's see...um, I own a pet
          store on Hudson Street. Dogs,
          cats, rabbits...no birds, they
          creep me out. Before that, I
          worked for Google, which I
          completely hated. One day, I
          decided life was too short, and,
          against my accountant's advice, I
          quit Google, cashed out and bought
          the pet store. Now I'm really
          happy on the work front, but I
          still haven't found, you know, the
          one.


          Ah, yes.   The elusive "one."


          I always imagined I'd be married
          with kids by now, but it doesn't
          look like it's going to happen that
          way. So, time for Plan B.


          Society tells us we're supposed to
          find that special person to make us
          happy and complete. But guess
          what...you have to create your own
          happiness. You don't need someone
          to complete you, some...man. You
          already are complete.


          Amen, sister.


          If you want to have a baby, we here
          at Single Mothers By Choice can be
          your partners. We will be your
          emotional rocks.

Zoe looks around at her new "partners." There's SARA, the
one nursing the toddler. And TABITHA, a tall women with an
even taller afro and a nose ring. BRIDGET, a young girl
covered in tatoos. And several more...


          From inception to college
          graduation and everything in
          between. We're here for each
          other.

Sara smiles and nods at her nursing child.




          Dakota was actually born right here
          in this very room. Right where
          you're sitting, actually.


              
          Really? Right here?      Imagine that.


          Best day of my life.


          And how old is she now?

Dakota looks up from the breast.


          I'm three.




Zoe and Mona are sitting by the window sharing a plate of
pastries and a pot of coffee.


          Why did you join a support group of
          unattractive, militant lesbians
          when you have me?


          Because you're really not that
          supportive.


          Sure I am.


          You just told me that if I breast-
          feed "my girls" will end up looking
          like empty tube socks.


          I'm just being honest. And don't
          even get me started on what
          childbirth does to your bladder.


          What does it do to your bladder?

Mona cracks up and then stops abruptly.




          I just peed a little bit.


          I don't think I'm pregnant. The
          doctor says it will probably take
          several tries. Something about
          frozen sperm being lazy.


          Good.   Take your time.

Zoe takes a sip of coffee and looks out the window.


          So, should I call this guy?   Do you
          think that would be weird?


          Do I think it's weird that you're
          pursuing someone at the exact
          moment in time that you might be
          most unavailable? No. Because
          that's what you do. You sabotage.


              
          He works at the Farmer's market.
          And it's right around the corner.
          Are you thinking what I'm thinking?


          I look fat and old?


          No.


          Then, no.


          Let's go spy on him. Come on. It
          will be fun. Like high school.


          I can't.
              
          This twenty minute breakfast
          concludes my "me" time for the
          week. More proof that you should
          not have kids.





The Farmer's Market is crowded with people. We hear the
sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby.

Zoe spies the LITTLE GOAT sign. But Stan is not there.    She
looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.


          Oh, well.

She walks towards 14th street. We see the bluegrass band on
the steps by the subway station. It's not a big band, just a
few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "The
Organics." The country twang of the music is in sharp
contrast with the tall buildings all around.

As she gets closer, she notices that Stan is in the band.
He's playing banjo.

Zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, OLIVIA'S
BERRIES. OLIVIA, mid-twenties, natural beauty, approaches.


          Can I help you?


              
          No, I'm fine.

Zoe watches Stan. She mindlessly starts eating some
blueberries out of the display pint. Olivia sees that Zoe is
looking at Stan.


          Tasty, huh?

Zoe nods and takes another berry.


          All ripe and juicy. And firm, too.
          Bet you could just eat him up in
          one bite, right?

Zoe now turns, confused.


          What?


          And don't look now, but he's coming
          this way.



Olivia winks and moves off. Zoe turns back and is now face-
to-face with Stan, who's smiling from ear-to-ear, his banjo
slung over his shoulder.


          A-ha! I didn't scare you away
          after all.


               
          I was just in the neighborhood. I
          thought I'd come by and get some
          blueberries. I'm going to make a
          pie.


          I love blueberry pie.

Stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to Zoe.


          I'm confused. I thought you made
          cheese or something.


          What makes you think I don't?


          I don't know, you're over there
          playing the banjo.


          Can't someone do both?


          Honestly, I didn't know anyone did
          either.

Olivia returns.


          Aren't you going to introduce me to
          your new friend?


          Nope.
              
          Come on. Let me show you around.

Stan puts his arm around Zoe and leads her away.   Olivia
watches them go with her arms crossed.





Stan walks Zoe through his cheese stand.


          This is our basic chevre, probably
          our best seller. The cheese that
          started it all, as they say. Then
          over here we have our surface-
          ripened cheeses. These are the
          aged/raw milk cheeses.
              
          This is really boring, huh?


          No, not at all.


          It's like you're in a foreign
          country and the only thing to watch
          on tv is a documentary on cheese.
          You don't want to watch it, but
          somehow you can't stop...


              
          I think it's interesting.    Really.


          All right, you asked for it...
              
          The aged/raw milk cheeses are made
          from raw milk and then aged for
          four to six months. Sometimes
          more. Sometimes less. Usually
          more. Depends on the cheese.


          Stop.   You're killing me.

FRED, early twenties, white guy with Rasta-type dreads, looks
up from behind the counter.


          Fred, Zoe, Zoe, Fred.
              
          She's the one I followed from the
          subway the other day like a total
          psychopath.


          Right...I heard about you.




          I don't know whether to be
          flattered or terrified.


          Be afraid.


          Don't scare her away.   I'm trying
          to redeem myself.


          Then you should put down the banjo.
          You look like a doofus.


          Doofus?
              
          Do you think I look like a doofus?


          I don't really know what a doofus
          looks like.

Fred points to Stan.


          Okay. If I put the banjo down, can
          I take you to lunch or something?


          I should really get back to work.


          Come on, say the word and we can
          have a six-course tasting menu at
          Union Square Cafe. I know the
          chef.


          That sounds nice, but, I should
          probably go.


          Well, can I call you?

Zoe smiles.




Zoe enters the pet store with two big bags of vegetables. As
soon as she steps foot in the store, Bobby and Jalisa accost
her.




Okay, spill it.


Who is he? What does he do?    How
do we know him?


What are you talking about?


Stan from the Farmer's Market?
He's called twice already.


Really?


Is he a farmer? Because that's not
okay.


No.   He makes cheese.


He's a pilgrim?


I don't know what he is. He's cute
and different and plays the banjo.
    
I think I like him.


What about the, you know, bun in
the oven?


I really doubt I'm pregnant.


You want to be pregnant. You don't
want to be pregnant. I'm confused.


I want to be pregnant. Of course I
want to be pregnant. I mean, I put
a lot of thought into this, right?
    
So what did Stan say?


He says to name any restaurant you
want to go to.




          He'll be there with bells on.
              
          He didn't say the "bells on" part.
          I added that. Sounds a little too
          gay, though, so I take it back.




Zoe walks down 8th street. This is the first time we've seen
her really pulled together, and she looks hot. She turns
into the restaurant she's chosen for the big date.




Zoe and Stan stand at the counter with an array of hot dogs
in front of them. Stan looks at the hot dogs skeptically.


          We could have gone anywhere.


          Just take a bite.   You'll see.


          Per Se, Jean Georges, Nobu...


          Gray's Papaya.   Cheers.

She clinks his dog and then they each take a bite.


          Good, right?

Stan nods, covering his mouth because the bite is so big.


          You've lived here your whole life
          and never been to Gray's Papaya.
          What's wrong with you?


          I actually haven't lived here my
          whole life. We moved out of the
          city when my parents bought the
          farm....not died, but actually
          bought a farm and moved upstate.


          That must have been a nice place to
          grow up. On a farm.




          What about your family?


          It's just me and my grandmother.
          She lives in a retirement community
          in Queens.
              
          My parents died when I was young.


          I'm so sorry.

There is a long silence.   They both stare at the hot dogs.


          I don't know what to say now.    I've
          made it all awkward and sad.


          It's okay.
              
          My dad was kind of a bad guy,
          anyway.


          Shit.   I'm so sorry, Zoe.


          No, come on, we'll get all this
          stuff out of the way so we never
          have to talk about it again. Let's
          ask all the awkward, get-to-know-
          you questions right now.


          Okay.   Good idea.


          Let's see...are you religious?


          Nope.   What about you?


          No.


          Have you ever been married?


          No.




            Aren't you sick of going to
            weddings?


            If I have to listen to one more
            couple write their own vows...


            I hate when they write their own
            vows!

They clasp hands. Not in a high-fivey way, but in a
connected, we have so much in common way. Their hands stay
together, feeling the charge between them.


            What about kids?

Zoe feels the blood rush to her cheeks.   Like everyone there
must now be looking at her.


            What about them?


            Well, do you want them?


            Yeah.   I want kids.

She pulls her hand away. This has all gotten suddenly real.
She looks at Stan, almost afraid to ask the next question.


            Do you?


            Yeah.   Absolutely.

Zoe nods.   Slowly, she starts to breathe again.




They are now walking home together, arm-in-arm.


            Okay, first kiss...


            Jen Salzer. Seventh grade. She
            wore a head-gear. What about you?




          Summer camp. I think his name was--

Stan interrupts by kissing her. And it's a great kiss. Full
of promises and answers. They linger there for a moment...


          That was way better.


          When can I see you again?

Zoe feels her heart jump.    She kisses him again.




Zoe is lying in bed with Nuts on the pillow next to her.    The
sun is shining and they are both waking up.

She gets up and goes to the mirror. She lifts up her
nightgown and looks at her stomach, this time with a slight
look of concern on her face.




Zoe and Mona are side-by-side on the elliptical machines.
Zoe is going very fast, while Mona is barely moving at all.


          What if I'm pregnant?


          Then you'll get fat and hormonal
          and I'll say, "I told you so."


          But what if this could go somewhere
          with Stan? Like, really go
          somewhere.


          Then it will work out perfectly.


          What do you mean?


          Because just when you really like
          him, you'll break up because you're
          pregnant and then you never have to
          put yourself out there and possibly
          get hurt. That's your dream.




              
          I'm not pregnant.

She gets off the machine.




We are in a foggy steam room with Zoe, Mona and a few other



          So, when are you seeing him again?


          Tonight.


          Well, don't have sex with him.
          That's the last thing we need. You
          get knocked up and we'll have no
          idea who the father is.

A few women look over.


          And then we'll have to do a
          paternity test. Is it the cheese
          farmer or the red-pubed bandit?

More women look over.


          I'm not going to have sex with him
          tonight. It's too soon.
              
          I'm not a slut.


          Well, bring condoms, just in case.
              
          And a pregnancy test.


          Very funny.


          I'm not joking.

All of the women are now staring at Zoe.


          I'm really not a slut.





Zoe sits on the bed, holding a pregnancy test in her hands.
Nuts is beside her. He looks up at her.


          There's no way, right?




Zoe pees on the stick.   Nuts is beside her, watching with his
head tilted.


          Stop looking at me like that.   I'm
          not pregnant.

Zoe finishes peeing and looks at the test.   Nothing yet.


          Come on, come on, come on...

We hear the doorbell RING.


          Shit.

Zoe looks down at the test. Still nothing.      We wait and
watch the test. The doorbell RINGS again.


          Shit!

A faint PLUS SIGN is forming.


          Shitshitshitshit...

The plus sign then turns BRIGHT PINK. Zoe's heart stops.
There it is. Plain as day. Pregnant.


          No, shit.

Zoe stands.   Looks at herself in the mirror.   And then...


          Holy fucking shit!





Manhattan fades into the distance, as they drive over the
Brooklyn Bridge. Zoe cracks the window.


            Are you feeling okay?

Zoe nods.   Her face looks pale.


            Good, because this should really
            be a culinary adventure. This is
            an underground restaurant that
            moves from apartment to apartment,
            depending on the chef.

Zoe nods again. Hasn't heard a word he's said. She rolls
the window all the way down and hangs her head out.


            And some of the guys from the band
            will be there. So, we might get a
            little jam going. Sounds fun,
            right?
                 
            Zoe?

Zoe's POV. Headlights from passing cars whiz by, and the
wind swirls her hair into her face. Brooklyn approaches like
a bad dream.




Stan walks down a long table filled with appetizers. He is
making a plate for each of them. Zoe trails behind, beads of
sweat on her forehead.


            And this looks like a mache salad
            with grapes and feta.

He takes some for each of them.


            And this, oh this must be white
            beans and lamb's tongue. You've
            got to have some of this. Etienne
            is famous for his lamb's tongue.

Olivia approaches.




          Hey, stranger.


          Oh, hey, Olivia.   You remember Zoe.


          Right. How'd that blueberry pie
          turn out?


          What?


          You bought blueberries from me?
          Said you were going to make a pie?


          Um, can you excuse me for a second?

Zoe hurries off.   Olivia watches her go.   Eyes narrowing.


          No way she knows how to bake a pie.




Zoe hovers by the window, whispering into the phone.


          I'm pregnant.


          What?!   Where are you? I'm on my
          way.


          Brooklyn.


          Where's that?

Zoe hangs up the phone.




Zoe is now on the phone with Mona.


          Don't panic. Could be a false
          positive. Take another test.




          I can't. I'm at some underground
          foodie party in Brooklyn. Where am
          I gonna--

Out the window and across the street, we see a drugstore.




Zoe runs down the aisle and empties one, two, three...what
the fuck, every pregnancy test into her basket.

Her cell phone RINGS.    It's Bobby.   She picks it up.


          Okay, I'm looking at a subway map.
          Which way is Brooklyn?

She hangs up again.




Zoe hurries through the living room, a packed drugstore bag
hidden under her arm. Stan comes up behind her.


          Where have you been?

Zoe jumps and accidentally drops the bag. The tests spill
out onto the floor. She quickly scoops everything back in.


          Sorry.   You scared me.


          Did you just go to the store?


          Yeah, I had a little emergency. I
          have a, a, um...corn, and I needed
          to get those little...corn pads.


          Corn pads?


          I know, it's gross. Do you know
          where the bathroom is?

Zoe walks off leaving him to ponder.




          What's a corn pad?




Zoe pees on eight sticks at once.


          Corn pad?    What the hell is wrong
          with you?

Someone KNOCKS on the door.


          Corn pad.    Jesus Christ.

The knocking turns to an angry BANGING.


          Relax! I'll be out in...
              
          Three to five minutes.

Zoe holds up the tests. One by one, the little windows all
show PLUS SIGNS and CHECK MARKS and DOUBLE HASH MARKS.




Zoe exits the bathroom with a wide-eyed, terrified look on
her face. By the bar, she sees a PREGNANT WOMAN sipping a
glass of wine. She rushes over.


          Excuse me, are you allowed to drink
          when you're...

Zoe makes hand motions at her belly, but can't say the word.


          You know...

More hand gestures.


          Pregnant?
              
          My doctor says one glass is--

Zoe doesn't wait for her to finish. She rushes the bar,
pours a glass of wine and downs it like a frat boy funneling
a beer.



Outside, we hear a banjo and guitar tuning up.




Stan, JERRY and SCOOTER are just starting to play. A small
crowd gathers round. Stan starts to sing an old tune called
"Sweet Little Miss Blue Eyes."


          Who makes me forget all the other
          girls I met, sweet, little Miss
          Blue Eyes. Who's sweeter to me,
          than she really ought to be, sweet
          little Miss Blue Eyes.

Zoe appears at the door to the patio.   Stan smiles at her
while he sings.


          Who's gonna start takin' care of my
          heart, she makes me realize. And
          it's lucky for me and I really want
          to be with...
              
          sweet, little Miss--

Stan's POV as Zoe covers her mouth with two hands and bolts
for the bathroom, puking.


          Blue eyes?




Zoe's head is in the toilet. Just when we think she's done,
she pukes again. Finally, she lifts her head.


          Ohhhhhhhh.

She spies an unused pregnancy test on the floor.  One that
must have dropped. Maybe this will be the one with the
answer she's looking for. She sits back on the toilet,
mustering up all of her focus to pee again. She closes her
eyes.


          Please, God...

But she can't pee.   She tries and tries.




          Water, water everywhere, but not a
          drop to...

She doubles over and pukes between her knees.   When she's
done, she holds up the test.

CU of the stick, which has no pee on it but is covered in
vomit. Slowly the test reveals a PLUS SIGN.


          Fuck me.




Stan and Zoe walk towards Zoe's brownstone. Stan is
practically holding her up. Zoe stumbles along.


          My singing made you vomit.


          No.    It's not that.


          Sure, we were a little out of tune,
          but...


          I really don't feel well.


          Is it your corns?    Hurts to walk?

ANGLE on Carol, from Single Mother's By Choice, approaching.
Zoe's face pales.


          Zoe?


          Wow.   Hi.    Hey, there...


          Where have you been?    You haven't
          been coming to any--


              
          Right. I know. I've been so busy.
          Next one, I'm there. For sure.
              
          This is my friend, Stan.




          Hi.


              
          Hello. Are you two--


          Late. Yes. We are. We really
          are.
               
          I'll see you at the meeting. Bye.

They walk on.   Stan looks at Zoe.


          An old...boyfriend?


          Her name is Carol. We're on
          a...committee together.

They reach Zoe's front stoop.   Zoe peers over Stan's shoulder
to make sure Carol's gone.


          All right. I have to go to bed
          now. I'll call you, okay?


          Okay.
              
          Hey, I was thinking, if you don't
          have any plans this weekend, maybe
          you'd like to come up to the farm
          and get away for a few days.


          I'll call you tomorrow.
          Something's not agreeing with me.


          Was it the lamb's tongue?

Zoe runs inside holding her hand over her mouth.   Stan stands
there for a beat. He calls after her.


          Okay, well...this weekend.   Think
          about it.





Zoe lies in bed. Nuts sleeps beside her. Zoe stares out the
window at a flickering street lamp, her face full of fear.


          What the hell have I done?




Establishing shot of a retirement compound in Queens.




The lobby is well-appointed and cheery. A young STAFF works
behind a front desk area. Were it not for a scattering of
PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS, you might think we were at a Ramada.

Zoe walks by the front desk.   ANNIE, an employee, looks up.


          Hi, Zoe.   You look fantastic.


          I don't know how that's possible.


          Something's different. Did you get
          highlights or a spray tan? Your
          face looks like it's...


          Please don't say glowing.


          Yes!   Exactly!




There is a small group of WOMEN speed walking around the
courtyard. They are fully decked out in jogging suits,
visors and nose shields. The ringleader is NANA, 83, fit and
fabulous.

On the sidelines is ARTHUR, 87, with his walker and big grin,
as he watches the ladies exercise.


          Morning, Arthur.




          Hello, my dear!

He struggles to get up.


          No, no, no, don't get up.


          Good, because I can't get up. Came
          to see my lovely fiance? She's
          looking fine today, let me tell
          you. Fine.

Nana rounds the bend and waves enthusiastically.


          Hi, Nana.


          One more mile to go. Do you have a
          minute? Talk to Arthur.

Zoe looks at Arthur who's now watching Nana's ass, nodding.


          That's what I'm talking about.
          Work it.

Horrified, Zoe quickly runs after Nana.




Zoe is now speed walking with the ladies. She mimics the
same strong arm movements and heel-toe foot action.


          Do you want a nose guard?   I have
          an extra.


          No, I'm fine.


          Are you sure? Ethel Silverbeck
          just had another carcinoma removed
          from her nose.


              
          I kind of need to talk to you.
          Alone.



Nana gives her friends a nod, and they fall back several
paces. Zoe waits for them to be out of earshot.


          Don't worry, they can't hear
          anything anyway.


          I'm pregnant.


              
          What?


          I'm pregnant.


          What?


          I'm pregnant.


          I can't hear you, darling.


          Jesus, Judy, she's pregnant.   Turn
          your hearing aide up.

Zoe closes her eyes.    Nightmare.




Nana hands Zoe a cup of tea.   Zoe's eyes well with tears.


          What am I going to do?


          I'm confused. Isn't this what you
          wanted? You bought sperm and were
          inseminated by your doctor. This
          isn't what we would call an
          accident.


          But now it's all happening so fast.
          Did I really think this through?




We talked about it for months. You
said it was what you wanted more
than anything in the world.


But this guy, he's...special.   It's
all going to fall apart now.


What makes him so special?


I don't know. He's very...real.
And funny. And different. The
other guys I've been with all had
their briefcases and their five-
year plans and their secretaries
they were fucking. Stan doesn't
have a five-year plan. I don't
even know if he has a plan.


What about a secretary?


Some kid named Fred.
    
I like him, Nana.


Well, if he's the right one, he'll
stay.


Do you really think so?


Gosh, I don't know. I hoped that
would be enough to appease you.


Should I still visit him for the
weekend? Or should I just vanish
and hope he forgets I ever existed.


Don't be silly. Go up there for
the weekend. Spend some time with
him and see what he's really like.


Yeah.   You're right.




          You might find out he's a total
          douchebag and then the whole thing
          is moot.

Zoe looks at Nana.   Douchebag?




Zoe is in the car. We are CLOSE on her as she talks rapidly
and a bit maniacally.


          Okay, so we'll just hope that he's
          a douchebag. Could happen, right?

WIDEN to reveal Nuts in the passenger seat.      He's yawning.


          I'm sorry.     Am I keeping you up?

Nuts closes his eyes and lays down.


          My whole life is falling apart and
          you can't keep your bug-eyes open?
              
          Thanks. Now I'm yawning. But why
          am I so tired? I slept nine hours.
              
          And I'm starving, too. What the
          hell is going on?

Zoe sees a gas station and jams on the breaks.




Zoe pours a massive cup of coffee. One of those gas station
Big Gulp cups. Even the TRUCKER next to her chooses a
smaller cup. Then, a look crosses her face.


          Am I even allowed to drink coffee?

The trucker looks at her.    She looks at him.


          Do you know anything about being
          pregnant?





Zoe's car is now parked on the side of a highway in the
middle of nowhere.




Zoe is sound asleep with her head back and her mouth open. A
small, empty coffee cup in her hand, crumpled candy bar
wrappers on the floor, and an almost empty bag of Cheetos is
in her lap.

Her cell phone RINGS. Zoe doesn't move. After the third
ring, she lifts her head and looks around. It takes her a
few moments to realize what's happened. She looks at the
little coffee cup.


          Thanks a lot, decaf.

She picks up the phone.


          Where are you?

Zoe looks around.


          I have no idea.




Zoe bumps along the winding driveway of this idyllic Hudson
River farm. There are red barns in the distance and green
pastures filled with goats and sheep. The house is an old
carriage house with a rusty weather-vane on top.

Zoe parks the car and takes in the whole scene. Stan opens
the front door, with a huge smile on his face. Zoe sighs.


          He's so not a douchebag.




They enter the front door.    Zoe takes in the charming
carriage house.


          I can't believe you live here.
          This is ridiculous.




          I just come on weekends. My
          parents really live here.


          Oh.   Where are they now?


          In the kitchen.

Zoe stops short.


          Wait, they're here? Now? Is this
          a "meet the parents" kind of thing?
          I wasn't prepared for this.


          No. Not at all.    I mean, you'll
          meet them, but--


          When you said come up for the
          weekend, I assumed it was just us.
              
          I think I need to lay down.




Zoe lies in the small bed with the covers pulled up to her
chin. Stan stands above her with an odd look on his face.


          Are you hung-over or something?


          I'm just...not myself. Give me ten
          minutes. A ten-minute power nap
          and I'm good. I need to regroup.


          Are you sure you're okay?
              
          Zoe? Hello?

But she's already out.   Stan gives her a little poke.




Stan enters the kitchen. His parents, JOAN and EDWARD look
up expectantly, as if about to meet their new daughter-in-
law.




          Oh.   It's just you.


          She's taking a nap.


          A nap?   Now? She just got here.


          Mom, I need you to not be
          judgemental, okay. I like this
          girl a lot.


          How can I be judgemental?    We
          haven't even met her yet.

We hear a SQUEAK, SQUEAK, SQUEAK coming down the hall.


          What the heck is that?

The SQUEAKING continues and then all eyes turn as Nuts rolls
into the kitchen and stops. He tilts his head.


          Oh.   This is Nuts.

Joan and Edward take in the raggedy/wheelchair-bound dog and
then look at Stan. Stan shoots his mom a look.


          Who's judging?!




It's now dark. Zoe is asleep in the exact same position.
Suddenly, we hear a loud GRUMBLE. Her eyes open.


          What was that?

We hear the GRUMBLE again.    It's her stomach.   She puts her
hands over it.


          Whoa.

Zoe gets out of bed and goes right for the Cheetos. The bag
is empty. She smears her hand on the inside of the bag and
then licks the orange cheese from her fingers.





Zoe peeks out of the bedroom and looks both ways.


              
          Stan?

No one in sight.   She waits a beat and then whispers louder.


          Stan!




Zoe peers her head into the empty kitchen.   Nuts is with her.


          Stan?    Hello?

Zoe stands there unsure of what to do next. Then we hear her
stomach GROWL again. Her eyes turn to the stove. Something
smells out of this world. She tiptoes over and opens the
pot. It's beef stew.


          Oh, my God.

She makes sure the coast is clear and then looks for a spoon.
She can't find one. She spies a loaf of white bread. Grabs
a piece, folds it and then scoops up a heaping bite of stew
and devours it.


              
          Oh, my God.

She replaces the lid on the pot. And now she just stands
there. And stands there some more.


          Oh, who am I kidding?

She quickly takes two slices of bread and goes back in. This
time, she uses one piece of bread as a ladle and then the
other to turn it into a sandwich. She takes a huge bite.


          Oh.   My.    God.

Stew dribbles down her chin. She takes a third piece of
bread to wipe her face and then takes a bite of that one.



Nuts starts to whine and beg. Zoe uses her bread-ladle to
toss some stew on the floor for him. It lands with plop.

And now Joan enters. Zoe and Nuts turn, their mouths
bursting. Joan doesn't quite know what to do. All she knows
is she's supposed to be open-minded.


            Would you like a plate?

Zoe shakes her head no.     Wow.   This is embarrassing.


            A napkin?

Zoe nods her head. Joan gives her one. Zoe holds it over
her mouth as she tries in vain to swallow this inhuman bite.


            I'm Joan.

Zoe nods.   Still can't swallow the bite.


            And you must be Zoe.

Zoe nods again. She tries to shake Joan's hand. It's the
best she can do. Unfortunately, her fingers are fluorescent
orange from the Cheetos powder. Joan pulls her hand back.




The dining room is warm and lovely. There's faded wallpaper
and an old stagecoach lamp serving as a chandelier. Despite
the inviting room, Zoe looks very uncomfortable.


            The stew is delicious, honey.


            Yeah, Mom, it's awesome.


                
            Have you ever in your life had stew
            like this? Come on, be honest.

Zoe looks at Joan.      Joan smiles.    It will be their secret.


            Uh...no.    Never.





They are having coffee and dessert in the living room.
Things seem more comfortable now. Zoe actually looks like
she might be enjoying herself. Nuts sits beside her.


            So are all the animals in your pet
            store...differently abled?


            Oh, you can say paralyzed. He
            doesn't mind.
                
            No, our pets are all in great
            shape. Purebreads mostly, but not
            from puppy mills.


            Those puppy mills are terrible.    I
            read about them in the paper.


            Well, that's actually how I ended
            up with Nuts. I bought him from
            this pet store near my house. Six
            months later, I had thousands of
            dollars in vet bills and had to put
            him in a wheelchair.


            You should have sued that place.


            I thought about it, but what was
            that really going to do? They were
            still going to sell inbred dogs.
            So...I took the money I made when I
            left Google and just bought the
            place figuring I would do better.


            You worked for Google?

Zoe nods.


            How could I not know that?


            You never asked.




          And you made a lot of money and
          then bought a pet store?

Stan puts his arm around her and gives her a squeeze.


          I love that.


          It's been fun. Beats brand
          management, that's for sure.


              
          That sounds like us, honey.


          It's true.
              
          When we bought this farm we just
          wanted to make cheese because we
          couldn't find anything we liked in
          the stores. And now, twenty years
          later, here we are...


          Sometimes in life you just have to
          take matters into your own hands.
          Make things happen your own way,
          you know?

Zoe forces a smile.   If only they knew.




The moon is full and fireflies dot the air as Zoe and Stan
walk the grounds of the farm.

Nuts trots/rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair.
This one is more rugged, with mountain-bike-type wheels.


          I can't believe that Nuts has an
          off-road wheelchair.


          He's got one for snow, too.      With
          little skis on the bottom.

Stan smiles and shakes his head.




          What?


          You're really something.


          Are you making fun of me?   Do you
          think I spoil him?


          No, I really think you're amazing.
          I mean, that story you told
          tonight. You just quit your whole
          professional life because of this
          little dog? Started your own
          business, just like that?

Zoe shrugs.


          You're very...unique.


          Well, you're a dime a dozen. I
          can't tell you how many banjo
          playing, cheese makers I've been
          with.


          I keep waiting for the other shoe
          to drop. Like, how can you be so
          perfect? Why are you even still
          single? I can't believe no one's
          snatched you up by now.


          I drive them all away, I guess.


          Yeah, right.

Stan takes her in his arms.


          Look, I know this is all going
          fast...the time we're spending
          together, meeting my parents and
          everything...but, I'm okay with
          that. I want it to go fast.


          It is going fast.




          But isn't that okay? Aren't we old
          enough to skip all the bullshit?
          What are we waiting for? I...want
          to be with you.

Zoe opens her mouth. She's got to tell him.    Before this
goes any further, she has to tell him.


          Stan.


          Come on. There's something I want
          to show you.




It's floor to ceiling wooden shelves all filled with cheese.
Stan ceremoniously unwraps a wheel.


          What is it?


          It's cheese.


          I can see that.


          It's a new kind of goat's milk
          we're using. I've been developing
          the recipe, and now it needs to
          age. It'll be ready for market in
          several months.
              
          Want to know what it's called?


          Okay.


          Zoe.


          You named a piece of cheese after
          me?


          Not just one piece. The whole
          line. This will forever in history
          be known as the Zoe.




          Unless, of course, it tastes like
          shit, and then we'll just scrap it.
              
          But that'll never happen.


          How do you know?


          Because it's going to be fantastic.
          Sweet and sassy and very complex.
          Why do you think I'm calling it
          Zoe?


          No one's ever named a piece of
          cheese after me before.

Zoe stares at the cheese for a long time.


          You're kind of hard to read right
          now. You're either seriously
          flattered or totally repulsed.

Zoe smiles.


          What?


          I want to kiss you right now, but
          it really smells like cheese in
          here.




The door to the dairy kicks open and Stan carries Zoe out.
Her legs are around his waist and they are making out like
crazy.




Stan carries Zoe up the stairs. They are tripping and
kissing and now tearing at each other's clothes.




Stan throws Zoe on the bed and then peels off his shirt. His
body looks amazing in the shadowy moonlight. Zoe lies there,
looking at him before he jumps on top of her.




              
          You're such a douchebag.


          What?

Zoe shakes her head and then melts into him.






They are now on their backs staring at the ceiling.    They
look happy and worn out

Their P.O.V. Those little glow-in-the-dark star stickers are
all over the ceiling. There's barely any glow left.

Stan lets out a big sigh as he looks at the "stars"...


          That was amazing. I mean, like,
          totally and exceptionally, over-the-
          top, amazing.

Zoe turns to him.   Takes a deep breath.


          Stan.


          Yeah.


          There's something I really have to
          tell you.


          There's something I have to tell
          you, too.

Now Stan turns to her.     They are face-to-face.


          Can I go first? `Cause if we're
          going to say the same thing, I want
          to say it first.


          We're not going to say the same
          thing.




          Well, let me go, because this is
          really embarrassing, and I just
          have to say it.


          Okay.


          I've dated a lot of women. I mean,
          not tons, but a lot. And, the
          thing is, I've never...been in love
          before. I've never even told
          anyone I love them before. Because
          I just never felt it. But from the
          day we met, from the first time our
          backs accidentally touched in the
          subway, I feel this, this...
              
          Maybe this is too much to say right
          now, but...I love you, Zoe. I
          really do.

Stan finishes.    He looks at her and smiles.   Zoe just stares
at him.


          In my mind, you were supposed to
          say, I love you, too.

Instead, Zoe covers her mouth and runs to the bathroom.     A
beat later, we hear her vomit.




Zoe is at the sink, furiously brushing her teeth.    Stan
enters.


          Zoe?

He looks at her.   Sees the tears in her eyes.


          Why are you crying? Everything's
          perfect.


          It's not.


          Sure it is.



Zoe takes a deep breath.


            What?


            I'm pregnant.


            Uh, I'm pretty sure it doesn't
            happen that fast.

Zoe shakes her head.


            I just found out.


            Pregnant? As in you're going to
            have a baby?

Zoe nods.


            I don't understand.


            I know.   It's hard to explain.


            Well, who's it?


            I don't know.


            What?


            I don't know who the father is. I
            kind of know him. I just don't
            know his name exactly. It was sort
            of anonymous.


            Anonymous?


            He's a donor. From a sperm bank.


            Seriously, what the fuck are you
            talking about? Sperm bank? What?




          I know, this is so fucked up.


          When did all of this happen?


          The day we met. That same day.
          And I didn't tell you because I
          didn't think there was any way I
          could be pregnant.


          But...why?


          Because supposedly with frozen
          sperm it takes a few tries and...


          No, why would you do this?


          Because I wanted a baby. And I'm
          almost forty, and I never met the
          right guy. I was afraid if I
          waited any longer it would all pass
          me by, and I'd miss my chance.

Stan just looks at her.       Speechless.


          I didn't know you. I would have
          never done it if--


          I just told you I loved you.


          Well....do you not now?


          You're pregnant.


          Don't say it like that.


          You're pregnant.


          Yes.   I'm pregnant.      I'm pregnant!




          I tell you I'm in love with you and
          you tell me your pregnant with some
          stranger's child?


          Don't say it like that.     You make
          it sound dirty.


          I'm sorry. I...I'm stunned. I
          don't know what to say. What the
          fuck am I supposed to say?! This
          is great fucking news?
          Congratulations?! Why did you wait
          so long to tell me?


          Because I'm freaking out, okay! I
          didn't know what to do. I made
          this big decision to do this and
          then I met you--


          Well, what am I supposed to do now?
          This isn't how it was supposed to
          be. This isn't what--


          I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Life
          isn't perfect. It's not all neat
          and tidy like your perfect family
          and your perfect farm and your
          bluegrass band. It's messy. It's
          fucked up. This is real life,
          okay? I'm sorry to break it to
          you.

They both stand there.    After the raised voices, the silence
feels more pronounced.


          I'm sorry.


          Sorry?   What's sorry going to do?

Stan walks out. Zoe stands there.     And stands there.   And
then she starts to cry.




Zoe lies in bed awake.    Nuts is beside her.    They are alone.





It's daybreak at the farm. FARM HANDS move herds of goats
from one pasture to another.




Stan lies awake in a small guest room.   Joan enters and is
startled to find him in there.


          Oh, I thought you were in your
          room. Sorry.
              
          Everything okay?

Stan doesn't answer.   Joan sits on the corner of the bed.


          Well, she seems really terrific.
          Dad and I both think so. She's
          smart and poised and...

Next door, we hear Zoe puking again. Joan stops.   Then,
wanting to seem open-minded, continues.


          And warm and gracious...

Another very LOUD HURL.


          And pretty and...

Another HURL.    Joan looks at Stan.


          What the hell's going on in there?


          She's pregnant.


          Oh, dear God.

We hear the toilet FLUSH.




Zoe sits in the passenger seat with the key in the ignition.
Stan leans against the car. They are both quiet.




          I don't know what to say.

Neither does Stan, who says nothing.    He runs his foot back
and forth in the gravel.


          I guess I'd given up on meeting
          someone like you, and I did what I
          thought was best.

Stan still doesn't say anything.


          But, for what it's worth...I love
          you, too.

She puts the car in gear and pulls out.    Stan watches her go.
His hands in his pockets.




Zoe stands in the hallway of Mona's apartment building.   A
beat later, Mona opens the door and holds out her arms.


          Come here.

Zoe walks slowly into her embrace. They stand like this for
a long time. Just holding each other. Until Mona's three
kids run out with wiffle-ball bats and chase each other down
the hall. A beat later, the toddler runs after them crying.




Zoe lies in bed with Nuts. She opens her eyes and stares at
the ceiling. Then, with a sigh, she gets up and does her
morning ritual.

She pulls up her nightgown and sticks out her stomach.    For
the first time, we actually see a little bump.




Zoe lies on the table with a paper gown over her lap. She
looks down at her feet in the stirrups. Sadly, we notice a
perfect pedicure.

Dr. Harris comes in with a big smile.




          Congratulations! What luck to get
          pregnant on the first try, huh?
          And with frozen sperm, too. So,
          how are we feeling?


              
          Okay.


          You sure about that?


          It's been hard. I don't know if I
          was really prepared for this.


          Well, your hormones aren't helping,
          and going through this without a
          partner must be difficult.

Dr. Harries readies the ultrasound wand and inserts the
device. He turns the monitor so that Zoe can see.


          Well, the good news is everything
          looks great. You are now eight
          weeks pregnant, which is an
          important milestone. With a little
          luck, we should be able to see a
          heartbeat today.

On the screen we see a small flickering dot.    Dr. Harris
smiles.


          That's it?     That's...my baby?

Saying these words out loud for the first time hits Zoe.
Tears fill her eyes.


          Hi, Baby.
              
          Is it okay? Is it healthy?


          Everything's just...
              
          Wait, a minute...


          What?   Wait a minute, what?




          Well...I see another heartbeat.


              
          It has two hearts?


          No...but you have two babies.

Zoe's mouth falls open.




We're back at Single Women By Choice. The women are sitting
on the floor. Sara is still nursing Dakota. Zoe has her
head in her hands.


          Twins!   That's fantastic!

Zoe bursts into tears.


          Why are you crying?   That's so
          lucky.


          Yup.   That's me.   Lucky, lucky, me.

The women are sensing the sarcasm, but not getting it.


          Are you okay? Is it a financial
          concern? There are many programs--


          No. I'm fairly loaded, actually.
          Used to work for Google.
               
          I'm sorry. This is hard for me. I
          don't know if I can talk about it
          yet.


          Take your time. When you feel like
          sharing, we're here for you. We're
          all sisters here.
               
          Let's give Zoe some space. When
          she's ready to talk, we're ready to
          listen. Deep, cleansing breaths,
          Zoe.



Carol takes a deep breath and then lets it out.


          Now, in the meantime, does anyone
          else have anything they want to
          discuss? Problems? Concerns?

Tabitha, the tall woman with the nose ring, raises her hand.


          I'm having a hard time. Luca keeps
          asking why he doesn't have a daddy,
          and I just don't know what--


              
          There's this guy. His name is
          Stan. And he's fantastic.


          I knew it!


          Uh...wasn't I just speaking?


          I knew you were with that guy!


          What guy?


          Zoe, this group is called Single
          Mother's By Choice.


          I know.   I'm sorry--


          Um, excuse me. What about Luca?
          He's been really, really sad.


              
          Have you ever met a guy and you get
          butterflies and you think this is
          the kind of man who could take care
          of me forever? The kind of guy who
          makes you re-examine everything?
          Like, maybe I can be a stay-at-home
          mom and be barefoot and pregnant.

The women stare blankly at Zoe.




          He actually lives on a farm! Plays
          the banjo! Maybe I could learn to
          sew and take care of the animals.
          Like Laura Ingalls.

Even Dakota stops nursing and looks over at that one.




The women file out. No one dares look at Zoe. It's very
awkward, although Zoe seems unaware. She turns to Carol.


          Carol, thank you. This has been
          really helpful. Just getting it
          all out and being with other women
          who--


          I'm going to have to ask you not to
          come back.


          What?   Why?


          I don't think we can help you, and,
          quite frankly, you're against
          everything we stand for.


          But, I thought we were all sisters.


          No.  Not you.
              
          Do you know how long it took me to
          conceive? Five years. I had three
          miscarriages and spent every last
          dime on in-vitro. And Dana? The
          woman with the short hair?


          Which one?


          The one with the really short hair?


          Yeah, that doesn't really narrow it
          down much.




            She   just flew to Memphis to watch
            her   baby being born. Seconds after
            the   birth, the birth mother changed
            her   mind and refused to give it up.

Zoe's face changes.     She starts to get it.


            So, as you can see, we are really
            dedicated and choosing to be single
            mothers, and you seem to be in a
            slightly different place. You're
            carrying two healthy babies, and
            you have no idea how lucky you are.


                
            You're right.


            I like you, Zoe. We all like you.
            But you kind of need to figure out
            where you are.

Zoe nods.




Zoe and Nana are walking the loop around the courtyard. Zoe
looks terrible. Like she hasn't slept in days. They
complete a lap. Arthur gives them the double thumbs up sign.


            That man is obsessed with my ass.


            I know.   It's kind of upsetting.


            He wants to take me on a cruise so
            that we can finally tie the knot.
            But, I don't know. What's the
            hurry?


            You've been engaged for nine years.


            No reason to rush into anything.

Nana looks over at Zoe.     She sees the bags under her eyes.




          You look terrible, dear.


          Thanks.


          You must really love him, huh?


          I guess I do.


          Honey, I'm sure he's wonderful, and
          I'm sure he loves you, too. But,
          you have put him in a really
          awkward position. Having a baby is
          a big adjustment for any couple.
          And you're not married. And he's
          not the father. And you've only
          been together a little while. And
          now you're having twins. And--


          Please stop.


          I'm just saying, if he actually
          wanted to stay with you right now,
          he'd be the greatest man in the
          world, and, quite frankly, I don't
          think any man is that great.

They complete another lap around the courtyard.   Arthur
smiles at them and then "raises the roof."


          Arthur's just about the best man I
          know, and look at him. He's a
          fucking idiot.




Stan leans against the fence looking at the goats. He has
the beginnings of a beard growing. The scruff makes him look
older. Thinner.

Joan approaches and stands next to him for a bit.


          You know, people thought we were
          crazy when we bought this farm.




             All of our friends in New York,
             they thought we'd lost our minds.

Stan nods.    We get the feeling he's heard this before.


             I guess I'm saying that you may
             have envisioned your life going one
             way, but the reality is, it could
             go a totally different direction.
             You just have to be open to it.

Stan watches a nearby goat coaxing her baby to nurse.      He
shrugs.


             Having a baby with someone I barely
             know, someone else's baby...it's
             just not how I pictured it.


             I used to work on Wall Street. Now
             I wear boots covered in goat shit.
             This isn't how I pictured it,
             either. But guess what...I'm
             happy.

She gives him a sympathetic hug and walks away.




Stan lies in bed looking up at the "stars." There's even
less glow now than last time. He sighs and then turns over
to try and sleep.

ANGLE ON Nuts' off-road wheelchair in the corner of the room.
Stan looks at it and can't help but smile.




Zoe and Nuts lie in the bed. They are looking at each other
on the pillow. Zoe scratches behind his ears.

Zoe goes to the mirror and does her usual. The bump is
growing. For the first time, we see a smile.




The Single Mother's By Choice women are sitting in their
usual circle. Lori is passing around a list.




          Make sure you put your numbers
          down. I want to have everyone's
          number handy in case I go into
          labor early.

Zoe enters.   All eyes turn.    She waves sheepishly.


          Hi, guys.

No one knows what to say.


          Hi, Zoe.


          I just wanted to apologize. I'm
          sorry I got into a relationship and
          wasn't honest with you guys, and
          I'm sorry I interrupted you,
          Tabitha. I hope Luca is doing
          better.


          Thanks.


              
          And I've thought a lot about what
          you said, about how lucky I am. I
          got into this whole situation
          because I wanted to have a baby.
          And, somehow, I lost sight of that.
              
          Anyway, I need partners in this,
          and I hope you'll take me back.

Lori smiles and hands her the piece of paper.


          What's this?


          It's a phone tree. I'm due next
          month, but my midwife thinks I may
          go sooner. I want everyone to be
          there. Are you in?

Zoe smiles.


          I'm in.





Zoe has her head held high and her cute belly pushed out as
far as it will go.

A WOMAN with a double stroller approaches.   Zoe smiles.


          Hi.


          Hi.


          Hi./Hi.

Zoe walks on. She sees her reflection in a store window and
smiles. She looks like an actual pregnant person now. As
she is walking and smiling to herself, we hear a familiar
voice.


          Hi.

Her P.O.V. Stan appears next to her in the reflection.     For
a brief second, they look like a family.

Zoe turns. They both stop. Unsure of whether to hug or
what. They just stand there.


          Hi.


          Hi.


          You said that already.


          You...look great.

Zoe touches her belly.    Proud but protective.


          How are you feeling?


          Okay.


          Good.

A long silence.




            You have a beard.


            Yeah, it's awful isn't it.


            No.


            Don't lie.
                
            Did I tell you how pretty you look?

Zoe nods.   Another silence.


            I miss you.

A group of SCHOOL KIDS, lost in their own conversations, push
up the block, separating Zoe and Stan for a moment. This
separation makes the moment all the more tense.


            I miss you, too.


            This whole time we've been apart,
            I've been trying to figure out what
            it is about you that I love so
            much. And I think that it's that a
            lot of people talk about doing
            things, but you actually do them.
            You're really kind of daring. How
            you quit your job and took over a
            pet store all because some asshole
            sold you a lame dog. You came and
            found me at the Farmer's Market
            even though the night before I
            acted like a total stalker...

Zoe smiles at the memory.      Stan continues.


            And now you're pregnant. Because
            you wanted to have a baby and
            didn't think you could wait any
            longer. Well, that's just the same
            kind of thing. It's...brave. And
            I can't love you for being that way
            but then walk away for the same
            reason.

Stan takes her hands.




          I love you. I've been waiting my
          whole life for you. And I can't
          let one little baby get in the way
          of that. I just...can't.


          There's something I need to tell
          you.


          Okay.


          It's big. And you're allowed to
          take all of this back when I tell
          you.


          What.


          It's not just one baby....I'm
          having twins.

Stan looks at her. Is she joking? Her look says no. He
takes a beat. And then, even though it's not a joke, he
starts to laugh. A little laugh at first and then a big one.

And then, Zoe starts laughing too.   The whole thing is just
so ridiculous.


          This is insane.




It's late. Zoe and Stan are naked in bed, lying face to
face. Stan puts his hand on her stomach. He feels the
little bump, new since he's last been with her.


          Do you feel any kicking?


          Sometimes.


          What does it feel like?


          Like butterflies.



Stan smiles. He likes this image. He runs his hand over her
belly. Zoe moves in closer. Touches his cheek.


          Are you really sure you want to do
          this?


          Yeah.     I'm really sure.

They look at each other for a long time. Finally, Zoe closes
her eyes and settles in for sleep, with Stan watching her as
she dozes off.




CU of a MONITOR where we see two distinct baby shapes
floating head-to-toe.

Dr. Harris holds the ultrasound wand to her belly. Stan
doesn't say anything. He looks on in total amazement.


          Are you okay?


          They're so...perfect.      They look
          like real babies.


          Would you like to know the sexes?

They look at each other.      Zoe smiles.   Stan shrugs.   Zoe
nods. Stan does, too.


          Yes.     Tell us.


          You're having two healthy little
          girls.

Stan gets tears in his eyes.


          Two girls?


          Two girls.


          Congratulations.





Stan and Zoe walk down Madison Avenue. All of the other NEW
YORKERS are on some kind of mission -- shopping, rushing to
meetings, or fighting for cabs.

But Zoe and Stan just walk slowly hand-in-hand. Every so
often looking at each other and just smiling or laughing.
Then, suddenly, Stan picks her up in the middle of the
street.


          Two girls!

A WOMAN with a BABY in a Baby Bjorn passes by.   Stan smiles.
Now he's part of this exclusive club.


          Hi.


          Hi.




We PAN past several small plates of food on a table.   A chef
tells us what delectable items we are looking at.


          Here we have a yellowtail sashimi
          with ponzu sauce and pea shoots.
          This is carpaccio with shaved white
          truffles. And, finally, an
          heirloom tomato salad with fresh
          Buratta flown in from Italy this
          morning.


          Thanks, Sam. It looks incredible.

Sam tops off their champagne and exits.   Stan picks up his
fork and starts eating. Zoe does not.


          Aren't you hungry?


          I can't eat any of this.


          Why not?




              
          Raw. Raw. Unpasteurized.
              
          Alcohol.


          Let me get Sam back. He'll make
          you anything you want.


          I don't want to hurt his feelings.
          You go ahead. I'm fine.


          Well, what are you going to eat?




The CASHIER reads back Zoe's order.


          Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with
          cheese, four large fries, and a six
          piece chicken McNuggets?


          Make that an eight, no, ten-piece
          McNuggets.
              
          You'll have some, right?


          No.


              
          Ten-piece. Someone will eat them.

Stan stands behind Zoe with an incredulous look on his face.




Zoe and Stan lie in bed, each reading a copy of "What to
Expect when You're Expecting."

Zoe has the McNuggets box on her chest. She dips each nugget
in three different sauces and then takes a bite. Stan
watches with a mixture of amusement and revulsion.




              
          Have you gotten to page 79 yet?


          No. I stopped reading when you
          ripped out one of my pages and used
          it as a napkin.


          Says here many women in the second
          trimester experience an increased
          sexual appetite.


          Really?

Zoe smiles and then slowly triple dunks another McNugget.
She takes a seductive bite.


          Are you coming on to me? It's kind
          of hard to tell right now.


          Yeah.   I'm coming on to you.

Zoe throws the McNuggets on the floor and climbs on top of
him. She puts his hands on her body and then starts to kiss
him voraciously. After a beat, Stan stops.


          What?


          You have chicken in your hair.




Zoe and Mona are on the elliptical machines. Zoe is going
very fast, while Mona is barely going at all.


          Why are you even working out? This
          is the one time in your life you're
          allowed to let it go.


          Because look at me. I just keep
          getting bigger and bigger.




          Well, yeah. That's kind of how it
          goes.


          I'm afraid I'm going to scare him
          away. I'm like one of those giant
          bouncy castles. Soon I'm going to
          take over the whole back yard.


          Come on.   He loves you for you.


          I'm just getting kind of freaked
          out by everything. He asked me to
          go to this wedding with him. What
          kind of first impression am I going
          to make on all of his friends?


          Well, you're knocked up with some
          stranger's twins. So, already
          you're not exactly...


          Not helping.


          Do you have anything to wear at
          least?




Stan, dressed in a tux, sits on Zoe's bed.    He turns to the
closet.


          Everything okay in there?

A cocktail dress FLIES out and hits him in the head.


          Never mind.

He waits a few beats.   Another dress FLIES out.


          This SUCKS!!!


          Honey, whatever you wear is fine.




          I don't have anything to wear!
          That's the problem.

Another dress sails through the air.


          Fuuuuuuck!


          You always look great. I've never
          seen you not look great.

Stan goes to the closet. Zoe is pulling on a long black
dress. She tries to smush her boobs down into the top.


          That's perfect. You look hot.


          Really?    You think?

Zoe turns to reveal the back.     The two sides of the zipper
are ten inches apart.


          Do you have a shawl or something?

Zoe bursts into tears.




A cab pulls up in front of Zoe's brownstone. Stan opens the
door for Zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress. While
it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great.


          You look smokin'.


          Thanks, honey.

Zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door.


          Let's go.     We're super late.

She tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight.
Then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around,
but again, the dress is too tight.


          Hmmmm...




          Why don't you sort of go in...head
          first and then turn around.

Zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie
down sideways on the seat. Stan tries not to laugh.


          Shut up and push me.


          Push you?


          Just do it.

Stan pushes her legs, and Zoe disappears inside the cab.




Zoe lies down straight across the seats like a board.


          I hate everyone.

She sucks in her breath and tries to sit up. As soon as she
bends at the waist, we hear a horrific RIP. She bursts into
tears again.




We PAN over the coffee table. There's a pint of melty Ben
and Jerry's, a roll of cookie dough  US Weekly,
and The National Enquirer.

Zoe and Bobby lie on the floor looking at the ceiling.


          Do you think he's telling everyone
          why I didn't go? I'm too much of a
          fat-ass walrus to go to the
          wedding?


          You're not a fat ass walrus.
          You're pregnant.

Zoe eyes well up with tears again.


          Why are you crying? So what?   You
          missed a stupid wedding.




          You got to have girls' night with
          me. This is way more fun.


          I don't know. I'm just so
          emotional lately. It's the
          hormones.


          You can't help it. Being pregnant
          sucks. You're emotional, and
          irrational, and you get back fat.


          I have back fat?


          No.  I'm just kidding.
              
          Okay, yes. You have back fat.

Zoe feels her back.


          How's Stan going to stay with me
          through this? I'm disgusting.


          We'll go shopping tomorrow. We'll
          get some hip maternity clothes...
          whatever that means.


          Look at me, Bobby.


          What?


              
          Look at me. What do you see?


          I see the most amazingly wonderful
          person I know.

Zoe smiles.   Tears come to her eyes again.


          With back fat.





Stan leans against the bar with a beer in hand. He is
watching all of the Farmer's Market girls and his co-worker,
Fred, on the dance floor. Everyone looks drunk and happy.

Olivia stumbles towards him with an empty glass of champagne.


          Why aren't you dancing?


          I'm just about to go.    It's late.


          Come on, one dance.

The spaghetti strap of her dress falls over her shoulder.
Stan notices. She steps in closer.


          For old time's sake.


          I have a girlfriend, Olivia.


          Never stopped you before.

She tries to kiss him.    Stan steps away.


          It's serious this time.

Olivia pulls back, surprised.




Zoe is asleep in the bed. Her bump looks very cute under the
covers. Stan quietly gets ready for bed. She turns to him,
half asleep.


          How was it?


          Boring.


          Good.

Stan gets in bed next to her.   Zoe scoots into him.




I miss my old ass.


Excuse me?


It was one of my best features.


You know what's weird?   I never
knew your old ass.


It's kind of like this ass but way
hotter.


I also don't know what you really
like to eat and what's just a
craving, or when you start laughing
hysterically and then crying and
you say, this isn't me, if that's
true because I don't really know
the real you. All I know is the
pregnant you.


That is weird.


Or like how you're horny all the
time? Is that you? Or is that
pregnant you?


    
That's me.


When all of this is over, who will
you be?


Hopefully, myself again.


But...who is that?





The clock by the bed says 2:30 a.m. Stan is snoring
slightly. Nuts is on the pillow beside him. Zoe's side is
empty.




Zoe sits on the floor of the living room sifting through a
box of photographs.

We FOLLOW her back into the bedroom and onto the bed. As
Stan slowly opens his eyes, she holds up a photograph.

His P.O.V.    It's a picture of a woman's ass.


             This is my old ass.

Stan blinks a few times.      His eyes adjusting.


             Why do you have a picture of your
             ass?


             My college boyfriend took it. So,
             I guess in fairness, my ass doesn't
             look exactly like this anymore, but
             it's pretty close. It's held up.


             It's a nice ass.


             You said you don't know the real
             me, so I thought I'd show you.

She picks up another photograph. This one is of Zoe at
twelve and at her most awkward -- short hair, braces and
acne.


             This is me in seventh grade.

Stan props himself up in one elbow.


             Wow.


             I know.




          You look like Anthony Michael Hall.


          This period, as horrible as it was,
          made me who I am. I think every
          person should go through a
          hideously ugly phase. It builds
          character.
              
          It also taught me that I should
          never, under any circumstances,
          have short hair and a perm again.

She picks up another picture. It's Zoe in a bathing cap and
Speedo. She's holding up a yellow ribbon and has her arm
around Nana.


          This   is one of my favorites because
          look   how happy I am. I don't even
          know   what place yellow is, but I'm
          sure   it's not good.


          Fifth place.


          But I still look super happy,
          right? That's all because of Nana.
          Whatever I did, she thought it was
          the best.

The next picture is a Halloween shot of Bobby, Mona and Zoe.
Bobby is all in green, Zoe is all in yellow and Mona is in
regular clothes.


          These are my best friends, Bobby
          and Mona. Mona and I met in high
          school and Bobby passed out on my
          couch in college and never left.
          You haven't met them yet because
          they might scare you away.


          Why are you dressed like that?


          Halloween. We were supposed to be
          a traffic light but Mona bagged out
          at the last minute and so Bobby and
          I just look like idiots. That's
          typical Mona, by the way.



Zoe puts the picture down and picks up another. It's a woman
in a hospital bed. She's giving the thumbs up sign.


          This is my mom.

Stan takes the picture and studies it.


          You look just like her.


          This is the last picture of her
          that I have. She lived for a few
          more years, but we never took any
          pictures because she didn't want us
          to remember her like that. I was
          eight when she died.


          I...can't imagine.


          She had a great laugh. And really
          soft hands. She used to rub my
          back before I went to sleep.

Zoe puts the picture on the bedside table, propping it up
next to her clock.


          Do you have any pictures of your
          dad?

Zoe doesn't say anything.


          I'm sorry. If you don't want to
          talk about it...


          My mother was in a coma for two
          years before the end. That's when
          my dad left her.


          Oh.


          So...that's when he died.    To us,
          anyway.


          God, Zoe.    I'm so sorry.




              
          It's okay. It was an important
          lesson. That's when I realized
          that nothing lasts forever.

This sad statement hangs in the air for a few moments.


          So, that's my story. That's the
          real me.


          Things can last forever, you know.


          Not for me they can't.

Stan takes her hand, and they stay like that for a while.
Just holding hands on the floor of her moonlit room.
Finally, the silence is broken by the telephone RINGING.


          That's weird.




Zoe and Stan enter the lobby of an old building in Tribeca.


          I'm confused. Why did you say you
          would come witness this birth in
          the first place?


          I don't know. Seemed like a good
          idea at the time. I was trying to
          get back in their good graces. Go
          home. I'll meet you there. I
          don't want them to see you anyway.


          It's four in the morning. I'm not
          letting you walk home alone.


          Fine. I'll just pop in, show my
          face and leave. Ten minutes, tops.





There are candles everywhere and a table of food and drinks.
Kind of like a birthing cocktail party. Zoe eats a brownie.

Carol approaches with Lori, who is wearing a caftan and
rubbing her large stomach. They all hug.


            Zoe, it's so nice of you to come,
            especially at this crazy hour.


            You're really one of us now.


            Are you sure you're in labor?
            You're so calm.


            Oh, I'm sure.


            Well, I just wanted to come and say
            a quick hi and good luck.


            You're not staying?


            You have to stay. Lori wants us
            all to be together for this.


            Well, I really want to be here
            but...um, the truth is...actually
            I've been wanting to tell you guys
            for a while but, the truth is...

Lori drops her head on Zoe's shoulder and lets out a giant
MOAN. It's long and it's awkward.


                
            She's having a contraction.

Zoe nods.   This is weird.   Lori breathes through it.


            Okay.   What was it you were saying?


            I'm back with Stan.




          Stan who?


          The farmer?


          Actually, he makes cheese. He
          named a cheese after me. Isn't
          that romantic? Sort of?
              
          Well, anyway, I'm not technically a
          single mother by choice anymore.
          So, if you want me to leave right
          now, I totally understand. I'll
          just walk out the door and--


          No, I really want you to stay.


                
          Oh.


          Listen, Zoe, if you're happy, we're
          happy. We'd love to meet him.
          Bring him to group any time.


          Well, actually, he's downstairs, so
          I should probably get back to--


          Great.   Invite him up.


          Oh, no, no, no...


          I'm not shy. I've been through
          this before. It's quite beautiful,
          really.

Zoe stands there trying to come up with another excuse.
After a few moments, it's clear that she cannot.




Stan looks up from the Hunan Lotus take-out menu he's been
reading to pass the time.




          Excuse me?


          Just a few minutes.


          I don't know, Zoe.


          You have to come up. They begged
          me. And truthfully, I'm kind of
          scared of them. Please?




Zoe and Stan hover over the dessert table. They both eat
brownies and keep their eyes down. Sara is next to them
nursing Dakota.


          This is weird.


          Good brownies, though. This one
          has peanut butter in it.

Carol walks by with a little DRUM, which she bangs
rhythmically.


          Come on everybody, it's time.
          She's getting into the water.


          The what?


          Oh, it's a water birth.   Didn't Zoe
          tell you?

Carol starts banging the drum again and moves off.


          What's a water birth?


          I don't know. But just so we're
          clear, this...
              
          Is not the real me.




          I'll wait here.

Zoe grabs another brownie and exits.




In the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is
an inflatable baby pool. And in this baby pool is Lori, who
is now naked and pushing.

Zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand.    Carol
is beside her, playing the drum and chanting.


          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.


              
          Wow. Wow. Wow.


          I know. It's amazing how the body
          can open up like that.

Zoe covers her mouth. It looks like she is going to throw
up. She stumbles for the door.


          I'm just going to get some air.
          I'm feeling a little...


          Don't move, Zoe, you're my focal
          point.

Lori then GRUNTS through another big contraction.


          Push, Lori. Push.

While Lori's eyes are closed, Zoe tries to sneak out.    Carol
chases after, still beating the drum.


          You can't leave.   You're her focal
          point.


          Can't she use someone else?




          She's in labor. You want to argue
          with her now?






Carol beats the drum faster now. Some of the other Single
Mothers by Choicers join her in the chant.


          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

Lori lets out a SCREAM as Tabitha and the MIDWIFE pull her
legs back. Zoe watches with both hands over her mouth.


          Oh, Jesus.
              
          What is...that?


          Sssshh. It's perfectly natural.
          Sometimes the bowels just let go.
              
          Hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-ya-hi-ya-hi-ya-ya.

The midwife fishes out the poop with a plastic bag.   Zoe
turns away, gagging. She drops her brownie.


              
          Don't move, Zoe, I need you!
          You're my focal point.


          What does that even mean?

Zoe turns back.   Her face white as a sheet.   Lori lets out
another WAIL.


          I need to turn over.    Please!


          Do it, Lori. We're here for you.
          We're all here for you.

Carol beats the drum faster as Lori gets on all fours. The
midwife lifts Lori's leg up to the side.   Lori lets out a
loud, WHALE-LIKE MOAN.




              
          Here comes the head.

Lori's moan turns into a DONKEY-LIKE BRAY.


          We can see the head, Lori.


          There's so much hair!


              
          I don't think that's the baby's
          hair.


          I want to see the head. Get me a
          mirror. It's in the bedroom.


          I'll get it.

Zoe makes a desperate attempt to run from the room.







Out in the foyer, Stan is paralyzed.   Next to him is Dakota,
who is crying.

Through the hallway mirror, he can see what's going on in the
living room: a hefty woman on all fours in a dirty inflatable
swimming pool with a hairy head coming out of a hairy vag.


          Stan, get the mirror!




Stan, walks backwards with his head down, holding a mirror.


          Excuse me.     Hello. I'm Stan.
          Excuse me.     Hi. I'm Stan.

Carol grabs the mirror and holds it under Lori. Lori lifts
her leg like a dog taking a piss and then starts to cry.




          Look at all that wet, curly hair.

Stan steals a look, starts to dry heave and rushes to Zoe.


              
          Let's get the hell out of here.


          I can't.   I'm her focal point.


          What does that mean?


          I don't know.

Suddenly, we hear a huge SCREAM.

Zoe and Stan turn just in time to see the baby emerge and
plop into the water.

CU of the baby in the dirty water still attached to the
umbilical cord.

CU of Zoe and Stan's horrified faces.

Zoe's eyes roll back and we:



OVER BLACK we hear silence. Blessed silence. No drums. No
chants. No screams. Nothing. Until, we hear the SPLASH.




We are CLOSE on Zoe's face.    She opens her eyes.   Blinks a
few times.


          Are you okay?


          I don't know. Why am I wet?

WIDEN to reveal that Zoe is lying in the inflatable pool.
Her eyes go from side to side. The horror of the situation
becoming clear. A spongy, purple thing floats by.


          What is that?




              
          I think it's the placenta.

Zoe's eyes roll back again and we...






14th street is just coming to life as the FARMERS start to
unload their wares.

Zoe and Stan head up the street slowly, wearily, like
soldiers back from battle.


          Wow. We really shouldn't have seen
          that.


          No.


          I did mention that I barely know
          those people, right?


          Like forty times.


          I feel the need to say it again.

They turn into the Farmer's Market.

ANGLE ON Fred unloading cheese from the back of the Little
Goat truck. Stan and Zoe slowly walk towards him.


          It won't be like that for us.


          How do you know?


          Well, for starters, you wax.

ANGLE ON Olivia crossing from her berry stand to the cheese
stand with a blueberry pie. She is about to place the pie on
Stan's table when she looks up and sees Stan and Zoe.


          Oh, hi.




          Hi.
              
          You remember Zoe.


          Right, hi.

And then Olivia notices Zoe's pregnant belly.


          Wow.
                 
          Wow.

At the same time, Zoe notices the post-it on the pie.   It
says, SORRY ABOUT LAST NIGHT.


          What is that supposed to mean?


          It's nothing.

Olivia crumples the post-it and turns to Stan.


              
          I had no idea it was that serious.


          I told you it was serious.


              
          What the hell does, "sorry about
          last night" mean?


          It's stupid. I was drunk and...


          It was nothing.


          What was nothing?

Olivia turns back to Stan, flabbergasted.


          You're having a baby? I didn't
          know you'd been together that long.




          Well, they're not mine...but, yeah,
          we're having a baby. Two actually.

On Zoe's look of shock we...






The fruits and vegetables and flowers become a blur as Zoe
runs out of the Farmer's Market. Stan chases after her.


          Nothing happened.


          Get away from me.

Stan runs in front of her, forcing her to stop.


          Nothing happened!


          You said, "they're not mine."


          I didn't mean to say it.


          How could you say that?


          I don't know. I was flustered.


          Flustered?


          I'm sorry, I'm not exactly thinking
          straight. I've been up all night
          watching Orca give birth!


              
          "They're not mine?"


               
          Well, I mean...technically, they're
          not.



The minute he says this, he wishes he could take it back.
Zoe just looks at him. She shakes her head.


          You know, all this time you're
          trying to figure out who the real
          me is, but who the fuck are you?


          Zoe.

She runs to a nearby cab and slams the door.




Zoe enters the apartment and slams the door behind her. She
runs to the couch and collapses in tears. Nuts wheels over
and stands beside her.




Zoe and Mona are at their usual table.    Zoe looks like she
hasn't slept.


          Do you really think something
          happened with the berry girl?    They
          both said nothing happened.


          Well, are they going to come out
          and tell me? And that's not even
          the point. He said, the babies
          weren't his. And if he says that,
          he thinks that. And if he thinks
          that, he's not really committed.


          So, now you run?


          Why should I stick around for the
          end of the story when I know what
          it's going to be?

Mona says nothing.   She looks like she might say something
and then doesn't.


          What? If you want to say
          something, say it.




          Do you know the end of the story?
          Can't you just give him the benefit
          of the doubt? He seems like such a
          good guy.


          You haven't even met him.


          Yeah, and don't think I don't know
          the reason for that. You were
          never going to see this through,
          Zoe. Never. It was doomed before
          it began. Just like all of your
          relationships. You get out before
          you get hurt.


          You don't think I'm hurt right now?


          Every man is not your father. When
          are you going to realize that?


          You don't know what you're talking
          about.


          I've known you for thirty years. I
          know you don't trust people. You
          and your grandmother, both. She's
          been engaged to Arthur for how long
          now?


          Leave Nana out of this.


          She's never going to marry him.
          Just like you'd never marry Stan.
          No wonder you ended up with a sperm
          donor. He'll never let you down.
          It's your ideal boyfriend.

Zoe's face changes.    She looks incredibly hurt.


          I used a donor because I wanted a
          baby.


          I'm sorry.     I went too far.




          Because I wanted to have a family.
          Because Nana is the only one I've
          got and she's eighty-four years
          old. And then it will just be me.
          So, yeah, you went a little too
          far.

Zoe leaves Mona at the table.




Zoe and Nuts lie on the pillow together.    Zoe scratches
behind his ears.


          Guess it's just you and me again.

Nuts licks her face. She gets out of bed and goes to check
her belly in the mirror. It's actually getting kind of huge.




Zoe walks down the steps. Stan is waiting for her on the
sidewalk. His hands in his pockets.


          What.


          It's Thursday. We have a doctor's
          appointment.


          There is no "we", Stan.


          Come on, I didn't mean to say it,
          and that's not how I feel.

Zoe shakes her head.


          I made a mistake trusting you.


          Don't say that.     That's not true.


          You're not good for me. You made
          me think I needed you, and I don't.




          So that's it? Because of one
          stupid, asinine thing that I said,
          it's all over? This is how it
          ends?


          Yes.  This is how it ends.
              
          I don't know why you're so
          surprised. I told you, nothing
          lasts forever.

Zoe gives him a matter-of-fact shrug and walks off.




Dr. Harris moves the ultrasound wand over Zoe's belly.   Zoe
holds up her shirt and watches the monitor.


          Things look great.


          Good.


          So, I'll see you back in two weeks,
          and we'll start checking to see if
          the babies are dropping.


          It's hard to believe we're in the
          home stretch.

Dr. Harris helps Zoe sit up.


          Now's the time I start discussing a
          birthing plan with my patients. Do
          you want me to wait until next time
          when Stan's here?


          Oh.    Uh, no. He won't be here.


          He's out of town or something?


          No.    He's just...out.




          Oh.   I'm sorry to hear that.


          It's back to just you and me now.
          We've come full circle.


          Well, don't you want anyone with
          you in the delivery room? You
          know, like a birthing partner?




Zoe and Nana are speed-walking.    Nana stops, excited.


          Me?


          Yeah.   Is that okay?


          Of course.


          Good.   `Cause you're all I've got.


          What do I have to do?


          I don't know. It will be a
          c-section, so, basically, just
          stand there and try not to faint.


          I can do that.


          Thanks, Nana. It means a lot to me
          that you'll be there.


          Are you kidding me? I've been
          waiting my whole life for this.

They pass Arthur, who is in his usual spot, but instead of
leering at Nana, he's in his chair with his head back and
eyes closed.


          Holy shit, is he dead?




          Sleeping.


          How can you tell?


          He's been like that all morning.    I
          wore him out last night.


          Wow.   I did not need to know that.


          We were celebrating.
              
          We finally set a date.

Zoe stops dead in her tracks.


          Excuse me?




Nana walks Zoe through the Shadybrook dining room.


          So, we'll put the band here and the
          dance floor right here.


          I can't believe you're getting
          married. What made you change your
          mind?


          All of a sudden it just hit me,
          what am I waiting for? I love him.
          He loves me. What am I so afraid
          of?


          Wow.   This is...really big news.


          You don't seem happy.


          No, I am. It's just...it just
          makes my situation seem all the
          more tragic. You're getting
          married and here I am...



Her voice trails off.


          Zoe.


          Don't worry. I'm fine.    I'm really
          happy for you.


          I'm worried about you, honey.


          I'm fine.


          I just don't want you to make the
          same mistakes I made. I've been
          alone for over thirty years now,
          and that's too long. Sometimes in
          life you have to forgive and move
          on.


          Are you talking about my father or
          Stan?


          Both, baby.




Zoe has her box of photographs.   She pulls out a picture from
the very bottom.


          Because if you don't learn how to
          forgive, you will always be stuck
          in the past.

The photo is Zoe at age four and a man who looks so much like
her, that it can only be her father.

After a long beat, she puts it on her bedside table, next to
the one of her mother. The two pictures, side-by-side make
up a family. Zoe and her father in one shot and her mother
from the hospital bed giving the thumbs up sign in the other.

Over this image, we hear a quartet playing WEDDING MUSIC.





The music takes us into the church and there we find Nana,
lovely in her wedding gown, and Arthur, dashing in his
morning suit, standing at the alter holding hands. Both have
tears in their eyes. Arthur lifts her veil and gives her the
sweetest kiss.

ANGLE ON Zoe and Bobby in the first pew, passing a
handkerchief back and forth.




Bobby leans against the piano singing a beautiful rendition
of "What a Wonderful World."

Nana and Arthur are alone on the dance floor.   It's their
first dance as husband and wife.


              
          I see trees of green, red roses
          too. I see them bloom for me and
          you...

Zoe watches, her hands on her belly.   Mona stands beside her.


          This song always makes me cry.


          Me, too.


          Is it happy or sad? The words are
          happy but the song is so sad.


          I guess it's both.   Happy and sad.


              
          I see skies of blue and clouds of
          white. The bright blessed day, the
          dark and sacred night...


          I'm sorry about the things I said.


          I know.




          It was really shitty of me.


          It was. Especially because you
          were right.

Mona takes Zoe's hand.


              
          And I think to myself...what a
          wonderful world...


          I don't want to be alone forever,
          Mona.


          Then don't be.




Stan stares off into space. His beard is back.   A CUSTOMER
surveys the different cheeses on the table.


          Is this new? The Zoe?


          Yeah. This is the first week it's
          been out.


          Can I have a sample?     What's it
          like?


          It's...very stubborn, overly
          suspicious and distrustful of men.

The customer looks up at Stan.


          Huh?




Bobby pulls Zoe onto the dance floor.


          Come on, you old maid.




          No.


          Dance with me. One dance.


          Forget it.


          Fine. But it doesn't mean that I
          won't dance with you.


          What?

Bobby starts dancing. But really dancing. Justin Timberlake
style. Zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk
away. But Bobby won't let her escape. He blocks her path
and keeps dancing. This time turning around and shaking his
ass triple-time, like Beyonce.


          Haaaaaay.


          Go away, you freak.

A crowd of old people gather round. They start clapping,
thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine.


          Smack it, Bitch.

Bobby takes Zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it.


          You know you love it. Uh-huh.
          That's right. Smack it.

The old people do the same. Trying to learn the hip new
dance the kids are doing. Several octogenarian couples
smacking each other's asses.

While this is happening, a weird look crosses Zoe's face.

Bobby jumps up and turns around to face Zoe. But when he
lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he
hits the floor.


          What the hell?

An OLD MAN in the crowd looks down at the puddle.




          Damn it. Not again.
              
          Nope. Not me.

A few other old people look down and check themselves.   At
which point, Zoe looks down and realizes.


          I think my water just broke.




The whole retirement community is outside throwing rice as
Zoe, Bobby, Mona, Nana and Arthur try to figure out the
logistics of the trip to the hospital.


          I'll drive.


          You're in labor.   You can't drive.


          I'll drive.


          You don't have a car or a license.
              
          You drive.


          We're in Queens. I don't even know
          what side of the road they drive on
          here.


          Will someone please just drive me
          to the fucking hospital?

All of a sudden, a white ROLLS ROYCE pulls up.   Mona's at the
wheel. She leans out and waves.


          This was my surprise for after the
          wedding, but let's hit it.


          This works.

They all pile in.



And then the car pulls off, revealing a sign that says, JUST
MARRIED...FINALLY! "Ensure" cans tied to strings bump along
behind them.




Things are a bit frantic in the car.


          Are you okay? Remember to breathe.
          Breathe in, breathe out, breathe
          in.

Mona looks at Zoe in the rearview and does Lamaze breaths.


          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee.


              
          Hoo-hoo. Hee-hee...


          Hoo-hoo.   Hee-hee...


          Please stop. It's getting really
          breathy in here. I'm fine.


          What about me? I have amniotic
          fluid on my Gucci tux.

ANGLE on the mini bar, which is fully stocked.


          Who needs a drink?

Everyone  raises their hands.




Zoe is being wheeled into Labor and Delivery with the gang in
tow. Bobby still has a glass of champagne in his hand. Nana
grabs the glass and swigs it.


              
          Bobby...


          What?




          I don't know if I can do this.


          What?!


          I can't go in with her.


          Well, I certainly can't do it.   I
          don't do vaginas.

They look at Arthur, who struggles to keep up with his
walker.


          Don't look at me.

Nana starts to hyperventilate.


          Help me, Bobby.


          Nana, pull yourself together. This
          is the biggest moment of Zoe's
          life, and you can't let her down.
          I'd slap you right now, but I'm
          afraid your teeth would fly out.




Zoe is now alone in a room wearing a hospital gown.


          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, hee-hee, hoo-hee.

 Bobby enters, all sweetness and light.


          Hey, girl.     How ya doing?


          Okay.


          Good.
              
          So, I really don't want you to
          worry, but Nana just passed out at
          the nurse's station and is now down
          in the ER getting stitches.




          What???


          Everything's under control. Good
          thing we're at the hospital, right?

Zoe jumps out of bed.


          Where is she?


          Get back in bed. All is well.
          Arthur's with her. Now, on to
          bigger and better...who do you want
          to be your birthing partner? Your
          choices are me or Mona.

Zoe starts to cry.


          I know. They're shitty choices.
          Do you want me to call your scary
          lesbian friends from your group?


          I don't know.


          We're going to get through this,
          okay? You just have to really
          think about it. Who do you want
          with you in the delivery room?

Zoe wipes her tears.


          Who is the one person you want by
          your side?




Zoe runs down the street with a blanket over her hospital
gown.


          Taxi!




Zoe jumps in.   The cabbie looks at her in the rearview mirror




          You're not an escaped mental
          patient, are you?


          Kind of.




Zoe runs across 14th street. The blanket flaps behind her
like a cape. She looks like a hugely pregnant super-hero.

And suddenly, she has to slow down and then stop completely
for a contraction. She leans against a parked van to steady
herself.


          Ow.   Son of a bitch, that hurts.


          Are you okay?

Out of the corner of her eye, Zoe sees an enormous strawberry
on the side of the van. And then next to it, she sees
Olivia.


          Are you in labor?

As soon as the contraction ends...


          Fuck off.

Zoe takes off again.    Olivia watches her go.




Zoe runs through the market looking for Stan.

ANGLE ON Stan's truck, where Stan and Fred are unloading
cheese.


          Stan!

Fred turns around and sees Zoe running. All belly and boobs
bouncing towards him. Her gown starting falling off.


          Whoa. I've had nightmares that
          started like this.




          Stan!

Stan turns.


          Zoe?


          Stan!


          Are you okay? Don't run!


          I can't help it!

She keeps running towards him. He now runs towards her.
They finally meet. Zoe is out of breath and can barely talk.


          Are you all right?


              
          Great. I'm great.


          Why are you in a hospital gown?


          I'm in labor.


          What?   What the hell are you doing
          here?


          It's you.


          What?


          Nana's my birthing partner, but she
          passed out and needed stitches, and
          Bobby asked me who I most wanted
          with me, and...it's you. It's only
          you.
               
          I don't want to be alone anymore.
          I love you. You don't know how
          much I love you.



Stan doesn't know what to say.   He's literally speechless.


          More than anything in the world, I
          love you.


          I've been in love with you since
          the moment you stole my cab.

Zoe bends over, holding her stomach.   A contraction.


          Hee-hee, hoo-hoo, it was my cab,
          hee-hee, hoo-hoo.

The contraction ends. Zoe can finally smile again.      Stan
laughs and throws his arms around her.


          Ow.   Ow.   Ow.


          I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I just
          love you. I love you so much.
              
          Let's get the hell out of here.


          Yeah. I think I really need to go
          to the hospital now.

They kiss again. And then pull apart and look at each other.
Stan has tears in his eyes.


          Let's go have our babies.

People clap and cheer as they hurry out of the Farmer's
Market. Even Olivia, watching from a distance, can't help
but applaud the big moment.




Some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing...

We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She is smiling.    She does not
look scared. And she does not look alone.

WIDEN to reveal Stan by her side.



And we PULL BACK and above the operating table and see Dr.
Harris performing the C-section. He pulls out the babies one
by one.

We FOLLOW the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed
back to Zoe and Stan.

Zoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other.
They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry.




It's night.   Zoe is asleep.

She opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she
is. She turns to the side and finds Stan sleeping next to
her, curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed.

To the side of the bed are two bassinets.   Each baby sleeping
soundly in a little pink hat.

And in the next bed is Nana, asleep with a bandage on her
forehead.




Nuts trots/rolls down the sidewalk wearing a sweater that
says, "I'M A BIG BROTHER."

We TILT up and see Zoe and Stan strolling arm in arm, each
with a Baby Bjorn with a rosy-cheeked baby girl in it. Both
girls have flaming red hair.

A woman pushing a stroller passes by.   She smiles at Zoe and
Stan. They smile back.


          Hi.


          Hi.


          Hi.




They are now at the counter with hot dogs in front of them.


          Who knew you were such a romantic.




          Well, it's the anniversary of our
          first date. Where else would I
          take you?
              
          Cheers.

They clink dogs and each take a bite.


          What a year, huh?


          Incredible. Wouldn't change a
          thing. Well, except for the part
          where you dumped me.


          And the part where you dumped me.
              
          Girls...Mommy and Daddy were
          stupid.

The babies smile and coo.


              
          Yes, we were. Yes, we were.


          The first time we held hands was in
          here. It started out as a high-
          five, but then I strategically
          turned into a hand-hold.


          How do you remember that?


          We both agreed that we were totally
          sick of weddings and hated when
          people wrote their own vows.


          That's right. I remember that.


          So...I hope you won't hold it
          against me.


          What?



Nana and Arthur come through the door smiling.    Zoe looks at
them, confused.


          What are you doing here?

And then Bobby comes through the door.


          Bobby?

And then Mona.


          What's happening?

And Joan and Edward. And Jalisa. And Fred. And Carol, Lori
and Sara with Dakota planted on her breast. And a priest.
And we...






Zoe and Stan, still wearing the Baby Bjorns, stand face to
face in front of the guests and the priest.


          I promise to love you even though
          you still eat chicken McNuggets in
          bed. I promise to name cheeses
          after all of our children no matter
          how embarrassed they are by it. I
          promise to always check out your
          ass when you walk away, and I
          promise to love you more tomorrow
          than I do today, which doesn't even
          seem impossible...

And slowly, the sound of Stan's voice fades out and the sound
of Louis Armstrong's voice fades in...

And we watch Zoe's face as she realizes that there are some
things that really will last forever.
