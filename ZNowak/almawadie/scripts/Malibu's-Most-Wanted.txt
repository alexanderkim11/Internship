     A tricked-out Cadillac Escalade with the windows tinted
     deep black rolls INTO FRAME.

                'It's like a jungle sometimes,
                It makes me wonder how I keep from

     A small crowd and the press are gathered around BILL
     GLUCKMAN, his wife BESS 
     and daughter BRENDA  who are on the porch of their
     12,000-square-foot mansion.






                 ... And so if you elect me
                 governor, I promise to take care
                 of California the same way I take
                 care of my own family; with
                 compassion, caring, kindness, and
                 most of all, with an interest in
                 everyone. My friends...
                         
                 'California is my family!'
    The crowd cheers and waves "Gluckman For Governor" signs.

                 Speaking of family, I'd like to
                 introduce my wife Bess...
    Bess smiles and waves.

                 ... and my daughter, little
                 Brenda.
    Brenda smiles and waves like a campaign-trail veteran.

                 Any questions?
    The press begins shouting questions.       Bill picks...

                 Deb?

                 Where's your son?

    Bill is instantly flustered and TOM GIBBONS, Bill's
    campaign manager (African-American, but the soul of
    William F. Buckley) steps in front of Bill.

                 Thank you for all your questions,
                 but we've run out of...
    Just then the ground shakes with a frightening RUMBLE.
    Everyone quiets down -- is it an earthquake?   As the
    RUMBLE HITS again, the surface of the water in the koi
    pond ripples, a la Jurassic Park.
    Reporters look around anxiously as another RUMBLE HITS;
    Bill's face falls as he sees...





    The Escalade rolls into the driveway, hopping up and down
    on its amped-up hydraulics like something from Crenshaw
    Boulevard on a Friday night.
    The rear doors pop open and MOCHA (a.k.a. CHADWICK VAN
    PELT), dressed head to toe in hip-hop gear, steps out of
    the passenger side.

                 Yo yo yoooo!   Listen up, y'all!
    He lays down a beat "human beat box"-style as MONSTER
     climbs out. She's big,
    wearing short shorts, a tight leather halter, huge hoop
    earrings and oversized designer sunglasses.

                 Y'all better chill...
    Next out is HADJI , a skinny
    Persian kid with cornrows.

                 ... 'cuz B-Rad G about to get
                 ill!!!
    The driver's door swings open, and a gleaming white      pair
    of four hundred dollar, untied Nike sneaks as they      step
    to the pavement; we CRANE UP, PAST Nike sweats, to      BRAD
    GLUCKMAN, wearing a do rag under his Nike baseball      cap.

                 Yo! What's up all you media
                 people?! This is B-Rad G, kickin'
                 it real from the 'bu,
                 represizzin'!!!
    Four fine white girls in bikini tops, vinyl shorts and
    Timberlands come out and dance behind Brad, shaking
    everything they've got. Reporters move in like vultures.

                 'Y'all gathered here on this
                   special occasion.
                 Listen to my pops, he's your
                   West Coast liaison'
                 So show up, don't make me throw
                   up.







                 Take out your purse and cough some
                   dough up.
                 My chickens get wit you, if you
                   vote right.
                 And don't worry y'all, cuz my
                   girls is tight.
                 Immigration, education, runaway
                   inflation.
                 California ain't flowin' like old
                   constipation.
                 Vote Bill G on your election
                   ballot.
                 If you don't I'm gonna hit you wit
                   a mallot!
                 Get Glucked y'all!
    Tom again steps in and blocks Brad from view.

                 That's it for today, guys, very
                 busy schedule, thank you!!
    Reporters shout questions as Tom herds Bill up the steps.
    Two staff members hustle Brad into the house.



    Bill Gluckman's election team  work
    the phones as Tom paces; Bill stares out the window,
    lost.


                 What's the damage?

                 We're down nine points in the
                 polls.

                 In fifteen minutes?

                 And dropping.

                 It's a disaster.






                 What's the spin?

                 I called the Times and the
                 Chronicle, they're gonna play the
                 whole thing off as a joke.

                 Thank God.

                 How the hell did this happen?


                 I have no idea. I thought he was
                 out of town.

                 Jen, I gave you specific orders to
                 get some handlers and keep Brad
                 locked down until after the
                 announcement.

                 I did! They flew to the ranch in
                 Maui last night!

                 Maui?! Wasn't he at the villa in
                 South Hampton?

                 I thought he was at the chalet in
                 Aspen.


                         
                 Nope... It was the compound in
                 Bermuda.

                 Oh for God's sake!   Can't we --
    Brad enters and Tom shuts up.

                 Yo, Pops, that was off the
                 hizzook! I just got you another
                 million votes right dare!





    Brad's pants are so baggy, they fall to his ankles,
    exposing his boxers. Brad pulls them up.

                 What are you doing here, son?

                 I knew I had to show up in order
                 for you to blow up. So I had
                 Captain Tony fire up the Lear
                 jizzy and booya! I'm in da hizzy,
                 gonna be on the campaign trizzy,
                 24/seven, you know, kissin' babies
                 and whatnot. Pound it!

    Brad holds out his fist and Bill reluctantly hits it.          On
    his way out, Brad chest-bumps Tom.

                 Bill, you've got to shut this
                 down, now. Tell Brad he can't
                 work with you, period.

                 No, no. I love his enthusiasm...
                 It's just a little misguided.
                 There must be something he can do
                 for the campaign, where he can't
                 hurt us.

                 Such as...?

                 I don't know... phones, stuffing
                 envelopes, making signs,
                 something.



    Bill is at the end of a stirring speech to the Women's
    Organization of California.

                 ... in Bill Gluckman's
                 administration, women will have
                 better health care, women will
                 have better day care, and women
                 will have better jobs! From here
                 on in, my campaign has a new
                 slogan!






    Tom signals Brad, who enthusiastically yanks a cord, and
    we...



    unfurls behind Bill. It is spray-painted graffiti-style,
    and reads: "BILL GLUCKMAN'S DOWN WITH THE BITCHES AND




    Brad looks on proudly; Tom closes his eyes, a migraine
    kicking in.



    An angry mob of women chase the limo as it backs down the
    driveway full speed.

                      
              Bill Gluckman's down with the
              bitches and ho's'?

                 It was supposed to read, 'Women
                 are first with Gluckman.'


                 That's old school. Pops, you got
                 to keep your pimp hand strong.



    The limo pulls in.     Bill, Tom and Brad get out.

                 Peep y'all later. I'ma go work on
                 my new campaign rhyme, 'Election
                 Erection.' It's gonna be large!
                 Yo! I'ma start on a new sign.





    He heads for the house.

                 That's it, Bill. If Brad doesn't
                 straighten up, your political
                 career is finished.

                 No, Tom. I promise you, I will
                 not lose this election over my
                 son.

                 What are you going to do?


                 Set up an appointment with my
                 shrink.



    Plush. Brad sits unhappily on an overstuffed couch
    opposite DR. FELDMAN. Bess and Bill sit off to the side.

                 So... Bradley...

                 Why you keep callin' me dat?

                 Well that's your name, isn't it?


                 It's my slave name, a'ight?    I
                 told you like fi'ty times.

                         
                 Yes, okay... B-Rad...

                 Wassup?

                 Let's play an association game.
    He picks up three CD's, keeping the backs to Brad.






                 Alright, B-Rad. I want you to
                 look at these...
    He turns the first one around. It's an NWA CD. Next is
    a Snoop CD, then a Naz CD, and last is Brad's high school
    yearbook photo.

                 Now, which one doesn't belong?

                 Shoot. N.W.A., fool.   They broke
                 up a long time ago.


                         
                 Dammit, Brad, stop acting like a
                 gang member. You're from Malibu,
                 you live in a nice home...

                 With nice maids!

                 Bill, Bess, go to your happy
                 places.
    Bill sits back, frustrated.

                 What are your goals, B-Rad?    What
                 do you want out of life?

                 To be the biggest rapper dere ever
                 was! See, I got something to say,
                 and I need the world to hear it.
                 I'm the shiznit. I'll buy y'all
                 cars!

                 I see. And when did you first
                 start feeling like you were
                 this... shiznit?

                 Oh, damn... way back in the day.
                 I've had these beats in my head
                 since I was a little shortie...





    Toddler Brad  sits on the floor, playing
    with a toy as GLADYS, Brad's housekeeper (African-
    American, thirty) vacuums, while listening to her
    Walkman. The PHONE RINGS, Gladys pulls off her Walkman
    headphones and answers the RINGING PHONE.

              Gluckman residence.
    Brad takes the headphones and pulls them over his ears.

              No, Bill and Bess are out of the
              country until December.

    His eyes go wide as the hip-hop gold enters his head for
    the first time...

              From then on it was hip-hop
              24/seven.



    SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BRAD sits alone at the table, wearing a
    Run DMC hat (a la "Rock Box", playing with his food. His
    headphones, around his neck, BLARE NWA.

              Finish those vegetables, Bradley.

              You can't be excused until you do.


              Tch.   Forget y'all.
    REVEAL: on the table across from Brad is a video
    conference system. Both parents are on separate monitors
    -- Bess's has a sign that reads, "Paris," and Bill's
    reads, "Tokyo." There is a place setting in front of
    each monitor, as if they're dining with him.

              That's it, mister.

              When we get home... sometime in
              the near future... you're going to
              be in big trouble!!





     Using the remote, Brad changes the channel on his
     parents' monitors to "Yo MTV Raps."




                  What I'm sensing, Brad, is that
                  your parents weren't really there
                  for you.

                  Nope.

                          
                  That's ridiculous!

                  What about your bar mitzvah?




     Bill and Bess enter with suitcases. The house is crowded
     with relatives and Brad's 13-year-old friends.

                  Mazel tov, Bradley!

     UNCLE LOUIE, fifty and fat, with prayer shawl and
     yarmulke, moves past them and calls out to Brad:

                  What's the theme of your party,
                  kid? Star Wars? Baseball?
                  Superheroes?
     REVEAL: THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLD BRAD dressed like Flava Flav,
     a big clock around his neck, looking like he's just
     smelled a fart.

                  It's O.P.P., bitch!
     Brad exits through French doors, and as we FOLLOW him





     It's like we've suddenly stepped into a hard-core rap
     video -- big-bootied home girls in bikinis freak with
     clean-cut Jewish kids as the staff serve barbecue and
     malt liquor to the freaked-out guests. Among them, we
     see a 13-year-old HADJI, MONSTER, and MOCHA, all nicely-
     dressed for temple. Above, a huge spray-painted banner

     Bess sniffles and dabs her eyes.

               Bess, I'm sensing you'd like to
               share.

               B-Rad, you're a wonderful son...
               it's just that, well --

               Oh stop beating around the bush,
               Bess. What we're trying to say
               is, Brad, that your behavior is,
               well, it's an embarrassment to the
               family.


               Yo, Pops, that hurts my feelings.

               I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

               Don't be hatin'.

               And, Brad... I can't have you on
               the campaign any longer.

               What?! Oh that's how it is?
               A'ight then. I'm Audi! I need to
               take a drive.





      Brad leaves, slamming the door behind him.

                   What can we do, doctor?

                   Well, his lack of parental
                   guidance left Brad wide open to
                   outside influence, allowing hip-
                   hop culture to firmly imprint on
                   his psyche.

                   Do you think we can bring him
                   back?

                           
                   I don't know. This is the most
                   advanced case of gangsta-phrenia
                   I've ever seen.

                   Oh no, not gangsta-phrenia!



      Brad relaxes in a lounge chair, wearing sunglasses and
      sipping on a forty. Bess enters wearing a Chanel suit.
      She sits on the lounge chair next to him.

                   Bradley, I know you're busy, but
                   we need to talk.
      Brad lifts his sunglasses and turns to his mother.

                   What's up?

                   After our therapy session I
                   realized that your father and I
                   could have been better parents.
                   We neglected you and I feel
                   terrible.



      MALIBU'S MOST WANTED - Rev. 8/22/02 


                   For real?

                   Yes.  So from here on out I'm
                   going to be a better mother. I
                   want to get closer to you... be
                   there for you. If ever you
                   need --
      Just then, her CELL PHONE RINGS.         She pulls it out from
      her hip and answers.

                   Hello? Celeste! When did you get
                   back?! What?! Oh my God! I've
                   been waiting for that bag for six
                   months!
                           (to Brad, covering
                            phone)
                   It's my personal shopper.
                           
                   Stay right there. I'm on my way!
      She stands.

                   So... where we... Oh yes. I'm
                   always here for you, Bradley. Do
                   you have my cell number?
      She hands Brad a piece of paper and exits. Brad pulls
      down his shades and takes a long sip from his forty.





      Brad sits at the massive dining room table as Gladys pours
      him a big glass of grape juice, then cuts up his food.

                   Gladys?

                   Yeah?

                   Ever feel like you don't belong?






               All the time, baby. Most folks
               only feel comfortable around folks
               who are the same as them. When
               they meet someone different, they
               get scared and angry, wanna keep
               'em down.






                  What do you do about it?

                  Nothin' to do but keep it real.
                  Be proud of who you are.

                  Yeah, you right... Gladys, when
                  they gonna leave our people alone?

                          
                  I don't know, baby, I just don't
                  know...
                          
                  Eat your greens before they get
                  cold, boy.
     A PAGER GOES OFF. Brad searches his pockets, pulls out a
     pager -- that's not it; pulls out another pager -- that's
     not it either; pulls out a two-way -- that's the one.

                          
                  Oh no, not again!
     He gets up and runs out of the room.



     Bill, Tom, the staff, and several AIDES of varying
     ethnicity are mid-meeting.

                  How'd it go with Feldman?

                  Great news. If he sees Brad five
                  days a week, he says we'll see
                  improvement in three to four
                  years.

                  But... the election's in two
                  months.

                  Right, good point.






                  We've been brainstorming on some
                  different approaches, and I think
                  we may have something solid here.

                  I'm all ears.

                  Guys?
     The team gathers around -- it's a gang pitch.

                  Brad might act 'ghetto,' but let's
                  face it, he's never been east of
                  Beverly Hills.

                  But what if we give him a little
                  dose of reality?

                  Let him get a firsthand look at
                  the ghetto.

                  You mean, have Brad actually... go
                  there?

                  Exactly.

                  Sounds dangerous...


                  It'll be perfectly safe.

                  How does it work?

                  We hire actors to play gangsters.

                  They car-jack Brad,     then take him
                  on a 'tour' of the     'hood... give
                  him a little taste     of what thug
                  life's really like.      It might just
                  scare the black out     of him.





     Tom gets strange looks from everyone.

                  Excuse me?

                  Look, I'm as down as the next
                  brother, guy... fellah. I grew up
                  in Compton, okay? But let's get
                  over the P.C. thing and face
                  facts. Unless we do something
                  soon, Brad's gonna cost us this
                  election.

     The team all nods.

                  I don't know... it sounds so drastic.

                  Maybe drastic is what Brad needs,
                  Bill. He is twenty-four. I mean,
                  what's he gonna do for a living,
                  rap?
     They all chuckle.     Bill sighs.

                  Who do we get for the gangsters?

                  Remember the anti-crime spot we
                  shot last month?

                  We've got it cued up.
     They turn to the TV and Gary hits PLAY.
     On the monitor:     A Gluckman campaign ad plays.


     A young, black gangbanger , glares at camera.

                  For too long, street violence has
                  torn Californians apart...
     A second banger , glares at camera.






                  Bill Gluckman wants to put our
                  divisions behind us.
     We cut wide: to reveal Bill Gluckman standing in between
     the two gangbangers. He's in shirtsleeves, tie loosened.

                  Fellas, instead of thinking of
                  yourselves as what set you're
                  from, or what crew you're rolling
                  with, why can't you both be
                  brothers. What do you say?


                  I guess we never thought of each
                  other like that.

                  Me neither, dawg.
     PJ and Sean think is over, nod and shake hands.

                  You see...
                          
                  'California is my family'...
     Cut to angle on Bill and the gangbangers playing
     basketball, having a wonderful time.

                  If we work together as a family
                  there's no telling how high we can
                  go.

     Bill flies by, obviously from an O.S. trampoline, and
     soars over the gangbangers for a monster dunk.
     Freeze on:     the two awestruck "gangbangers."


     As they talk we see Brad, out the window, raising a
     banner.

               Those are our guys, right there.

                  Will he be safe?






                  Absolutely.

                          (fed up and
                           confused)
                  I don't know... can't we just...
     He looks out the window and sees Brad's new banner.       It
     reads, in graffiti colors: "ELECTION ERECTION."

                  Alright, fine, just do it.




     Brad urgently runs into the Mali-Brew Coffee Shop
     , where he and his crew spend ninety
     percent of their time. He is stopped at the door by a
     very worried Mocha and Monster.

                  Lemme go.

                  You don't want to see him like dis.

                  What happened?

                  He O.D.'d again.


                  Why didn't you stop him?

                  I tried, yo!

                  How many did he do?

                  Like twelve, thirteen, I don't
                  know!

                  Damn. Twelve Frapachizzo's.
                  Brotha's caffeined out. Move
                  aside.





      Brad pushes past and looks on in horror at Hadji, pacing
      and talking to himself like a rabid dog on angel dust.

                   I'ma get mine! Step, fool!   I'll
                   cut you, I swear!

                   Just chill, Hadji, we're here to
                   help. What's up?

                           
                   I... I... I was pickin' up
                   aromatherapy candles at
                   Illuminations for Moms, right?
                   And the counter trick gave me
                   lemon when I specifically axed for
                   lilac!
      Brad turns to Hadji.

                   It's on now!
      MUSIC:   PUBLIC ENEMY'S "Fight The Power" KICKS IN as
      we --



      Brad, followed by his crew, exit, ready for battle.




      We're still listening to     "FIGHT THE POWER," only now it's
      a Muzac version, piped in     through the mall's PA SYSTEM.
      Brad, Hadji, Monster and     Mocha strut through the mall.
      Rich shoppers get out of     the way.



      Brad and his crew approach the OLD WOMAN CASHIER.






                   Yo, fool! We got some hard-core
                   drama 'bout to go down right neow!!

                   Dat's right!

                   Dis is our mall. Always was and
                   always will be!

                   Woof woof!


                   Oh, Mr. Amiraslani. I'm so glad
                   you came back. Our clerk
                   accidentally gave you the wrong
                   aromatherapy candles. Here you
                   go.
      She hands Hadji a box marked "Lilac."

                   You better be validatin' my
                   parking?

                   Of course, sir.

                   Dat's what I'm talkin' 'bout.    We
                   get ours!



      Tom, standing by a limo, is speaking with Sean and PJ,
      dressed as their actual, preppy selves.

                           
                   Hold the phone, buddy... you want
                   us to scare this kid until he
                   starts acting like a nice little
                   white boy again?

                   Don't think you can handle it?






                  Of course I can handle it. I
                  studied at Juilliard for God's
                  sake.

                  Fantastic.
     Tom hands them a manila envelope.

                  Here's some background information
                  on Brad.

     PJ pulls Brad's CD from the envelope.

     It is Brad, throwing the Malibu sign, surrounded by women
     in thongs with gigantic asses. The title, in graffiti
     font, reads: "MALI-BOOTAY!"

                  Malibootay?


                  He considers himself a 'rapper.'

                  Frickin' A.
     They all laugh.        Tom hands them a checklist/itinerary.


                  Okay, so here's the story -- it's
                  your basic kidnapping...

                  So we hold him for ransom?

                  Right.   But when you see   him
                  acting ghetto and all, it    pisses
                  you off  so much, you tour   him
                  around the 'hood to show    him what
                  things are really like.
                          
                  I had my guys brainstorm    a few
                  ideas...






                          
                  'Mugging, drive-by shooting, crack
                  deal gone bad...'

                  Why don't you have him steal some
                  watermelon while you're at it?

                  Pays fifteen grand apiece.

                          
                  We're in.

                  Good.

                  Wait -- we're kidnapping him,
                  couldn't we get arrested?

                  Got you covered. Mr. Gluckman's a
                  billionaire -- if you run into any
                  problems with the law, we're very
                  close with the commissioner. On
                  the flip side, if you screw up and
                  a single hair is touched on
                  Bradley's over-privileged head, I
                  will make sure that you do serious
                  time. Clear?

                  Cris... tal.

                  Good.

                  What about the money?
     Pulls out a smaller envelope.

                  Five up front, twenty-five when
                  you return him to us, white.

                  ... As the driven snow.






                  I'll call you.
     Tom gets in the limo and leaves as Sean and PJ head for
     their car.

                  Congrats, my brother.   We just
                  booked another gig.

                  Yeah, but it's totally dangerous,
                  dude. You know what it's like in
                  the 'hood. We could get shot!


                  We can handle ourselves. Come on,
                  man, it's the ultimate acting
                  challenge.

                  You know what really chaps  my ass?
                  After years of training and  study,
                  the only parts they'll give  us are
                  gangbangers. Just once I'd   like
                  to play a character who has  decent
                  grammar and doesn't wear
                  Timberlands.

                  Beats gettin' dunked on by Bill
                  Gluckman.

                  Do we even know anybody down
                  there?
     They think, then come up with it at the same time.

                  My cousin.

                  Shondra.



     in a Wienie In a Bun uniform, chewing gum and looking
     like she's smelling something nasty.





     She's at the counter facing Sean and PJ.     PJ studies the
     menu.

                  You zooted, nigga?



                  Honest to God.

                  That's the stupidest thing I ever
                  heard. I got better things to do
                  with my time, boy.

                  Like work at Wienie In A Bun?

                  Really. You're the one always
                  talkin' about improvin' yourself.

                  I am improvin' myself, fool. I
                  broke up with no-good gang-bangin'
                  Tec, I'm going to beauty school,
                  then I'ma hook up my own salon...

                  In the meantime, how about hooking
                  a brother up with a Pepsi and some
                  fries?

                  Shut up, stupid.

                  Do this, Shondra. You'll get some
                  real money so you can quit this
                  minimum wage crap and start up
                  your business.

                  What you payin'?

                  A grand.

                  Make it trey, we on.






                  Jesus Christ, three grand?

                  Or you can kiss my ass.

                  Deal.   Now how about those fries?
     MUSIC:   An UPTEMPO RAP TRACK KICKS IN as we...





      Sean sits on a second-hand couch in their barren, low-
      rent apartment, concentrating on reading an Ebonics
      dictionary. PJ enters from outside, sweating and
      carrying a heavy box marked: "JOHN'S PROP HOUSE." He
      wears a stylish Nike baseball cap.

                We're strapped now, my brother.
      He sets the box down and begins pulling out guns.

                They have everything we ordered?


                Glocks, Uzis, Tec-9s...
      PJ takes off the cap to wipe his brow, revealing that his
      hair has been braided into cornrows.

                What the hell is that?

                Oh, my hair? Shondra just did it.
                        
                What? You hate it?

                No. I just think it's a choice my
                character would have made.

                Don't go there, Sean. You're just
                jealous you didn't think of it
                first.

                Whatever.



      Sean enters with a big box marked "THUG LIFE." He has on
      a wig identical to Larenz Tate's braids and beads in
      Menace II Society.

                Okay, got the gangsta wear.





      PJ bursts into laughter.

                   What's so funny?

                   That wig, man! I didn't know this
                   was Halloween. Bring me back some
                   candy!
      He doubles over, falling on the floor.

                   Whatever.

      Sean yanks the wig off and whips it into the corner.



      PJ has on baggy jeans. Sean yanks them down so his
      boxers are hanging out. PJ smiles -- perfect.



      PJ and Sean, now in full gangsta gear, practice their
      pimp struts...




      Sean and PJ stand side by side in front of a full-length
      mirror, practicing making angry faces and pulling guns
      from their pants, as we...



      His face filled with rage.

                   Gimme your ride, punk, or I will
                   dust yo ass!





      WIDEN to reveal PJ watching Sean, shaking his head.

                   Nope, you're not convincing me.
                   Remember your core character.
                   You're an oppressed black man from
                   the ghetto.

                   Yeah, I know, I'm having trouble
                   finding this one. Lemme try it
                   again.  Gimme your ride, punk, or
                   I will dust yo ass!


                   Add a 'beeyotch' and I think
                   you're there.
      MUSIC: the MUSIC SEGUES from our MONTAGE RAP BEAT TO
      Mocha's HUMAN BEAT BOX, as we...



      as a car door opens, boots hit the pavement, and
      Shondra's incredibly fine ass slides INTO FRAME.          We
      FOLLOW it as it moves to:


      Shondra enters, looking ghetto fab hot. People look at
      her like she just landed from Mars. She raises her
      sunglasses, sees Brad and crew playing dominoes at a
      table. Brad slaps down the winner; points at Monster.

                   I'm thin to win!
                           
                   'The name is B-Rad,

                   Go get my latte nonfat,
                   And don't forget the sprinkle!'
      They pound and congratulate Brad on his      brilliance.
      Shondra drops her shades back down and      moves in. Hadji
      sees her first. His jaw drops, then he       tugs on Mocha's
      shirt, whose jaw drops, then Mocha tugs      on Brad's shirt.

                   Yo, what up, fool?   I'm --





     Brad sees Shondra and freezes.      Everything goes SLOW



     strutting toward him.



                  Girl you fly.







                  Thank you.

                  Let me get them tig ol' bitties.

                  Word up.
     She throws open her shirt, and before we see anything
     we...




     His eyes go wide, then we're...
     BACK TO REAL TIME: Brad snaps to as Shondra brushes by
     and then moves to the counter.

                  Can I help you?

                  Coffee.

                  too, girl.

                  Cool, playa.
     She smiles.     Brad follows her over to the condiment
     table.






                  I ain't seen you in here before.

                  Malibu... Represent.
     Bard throws the "M" sign.

                  Right. I guess it's pretty
                  hardcore up in here.

                  The Calabasis Crabs... and behind
                  dem...
     We PAN TO another table, where four thug posers sit.

                  Damn.   How do you deal?

                  All day every day.
     She smiles seductively.

                  Was that you droppin' rhymes when
                  I came in?

     Brad hands her his CD.

                  Mali-boo-tay, huh? Looks phat.
                  You gettin' any air play?

                  I'm holdin' out for Power 106. I
                  sent Big Boy a CD, he just ain't
                  gotten back to me yet.


                  Sounds just like that fat fool.
                  I'll talk to him 'bout it.

                          
                  Hold dup? You know Big Boy?

                  Hell yeah. I see him at the swap
                  meet almost every Sunday.

      She heads off.      Brad turns to his posse.

                   hookin' me up with Big Boy

                   some sick tracks.

      They all pound as Mocha starts throwing beats.



      Shondra's on her Nextel cell phone.

                   It's on.



      Sean listens to Shondra on his Nextel, then looks at PJ
      and nods gravely.




     They drive along the Santa Monica Freeway, heading east.

               So what do you rap about?






                  Oh, I can rap about anything.

                  What's that?

                  A businesswoman.

                  Oh.

                  One day I'ma have a chain of
                  beauty salons all up in the 90210,
                  just like Starbucks, only instead
                  of coffee, with hair and nails.

                  rich hoochies ghetto fab.

                  fine and smart too. You gonna
                  blow up huge, no doubt.
     She's taken aback by his sincerity.      She doesn't get much
     validation from guys.

                  Thank you.

                  For real, girl. You like a cross
                  between Martha Stewart and Oprah.
                  I'ma call you Mothrah.
     She gives him a strange look, then notices where they
     are.

                  Take this exit.
     Brad swerves across three lanes of the freeway to take
     the exit, and suddenly finds himself actually in South
     Central. He's awestruck -- he notices a homeless guy
     with a shopping cart loaded with bags of stuff.

                  Yo. He really should use
                  delivery.
     Suddenly Sean pops his head into the car and stares
     directly at Brad. He puts a prop Tec 9 in Brad's chest
     and yanks him out of the car.


                  Gimme yo ride, punk, or I will
                  dust yo ass... beeyotch!

                   I think I'm gonna throw up.

                   And I'm about to wet you up if you

      Sean takes off.

                   night!
                           
                   B-Rad!

                   Your papa's gonna pay or you're
                   gonna pay!





      Brad sneaks out his two way and types in...


      as Brad's frantic message pops on: "911! 911! I BEEN
      CAR JACKED! HELP! B-RAD!" A hand slaps a domino
      violently down next to the pager as we...




      Monster has just slammed down the winner, and the PAGER
      with Brad's message flies off the table and SHATTERS on
      the floor. Monster, Mocha and Hadji are unaware.

                   Bam! Y'all owe me seven hundred
                   dollars!





     Hadji reluctantly hands her a wad of cash as she laughs.

                  A'ight, come on now, let's stop
                  messing around. B told us to lay
                  down some beats for the new album.

                  Lemme go free style.

                  Free style, please! Your momma
                  rap better than you.


                  Don't you talk about my momma.

                  I'll talk about your momma all I
                  want.

                  You ain't got the bizalls, bitch!

                  Oh yeah? Peep dis. Your momma's
                  so poor, when she shops at
                  Barneys, she has to drive herself!

                  Oooh!

                  Yeah? Well your momma's so poor,
                  when she went to Monte Carlo, she
                  flew commercial.

                  Dang!

                  Your momma's so poor, her round
                  the world cruise ended in Spain!

                  Bam!

                  Your momma's so poor, when she
                  stayed at the Four Seasons, she
                  could only afford three.






                   Oh damn, it's on now!



      The ESCALADE pulls into Shondra's driveway and SCREECHES
      to a stop. PJ hauls Brad out of the back as Sean climbs
      out.

                   Let's get him inside.


                   Dang. Why you doin' this to a
                   brother?

                   A brother?

                   Oh no you didn't.

                   Whose brother?

                   Yours, y'all.    I'm down.

                   Down?    God damn!

                   Uh-oh.    You done did it now.

                   You are not black! You can never
                   be black. And your perpetratin'
                   ass is stealin' the only thing I
                   got -- my culture!

                   What the hell makes you think you
                   know what's goin' down in the
                   'hood?!








                    You think this is a joke, wigga?!

                    I'm sorry.   Don't be hatin'.

                    You a long way from the beach now,
                    punk! You in South Central. The
                    ghetto. The 'hood. It's hard
                    core up in here! People here die
                    every day!
       Two LITTLE GIRLS are walking by.


                    Hey, Shondra! Can you come on by
                    later? Princess just had her
                    litter of puppies.

                            (seeing Brad looking
                             puzzled by this;
                             waving)
                    Okay then.

                            
                    They're pit bulls.

                    Mean pit bulls.

                    Now get ya ass inside.



thru                                                                 thru



       Sean and PJ push Brad in. Bars are on the windows.     Sean
       pats Brad down, and pulls out his pager.

                    You got anything else on you,
                    fool?






                  Uh... just this...
     Brad pulls out another pager, a phone, another phone.
     Sean and PJ both pull several more out of his other
     pockets, as well as his wallet.

                  All that James Bond electronic
                  crap can't save you now, fool.
                  Sit ya ass down.
     Brad does, and PJ duct-tapes his hands behind his back.


                  We gonna go call yo daddy.

                  You better pray he home. If he
                  not, you're one dusted trick!
     Sean, PJ and Shondra exit, slamming the door behind them.


     Sean and PJ immediately drop their bad-ass personas.

                  Did you buy my rage?

                  You're indicating.

                  I'm indicating?






                          
                  'I will smoke your dumb wigga
                  ass'? Come on.

                          
                  'If he not, you're one dusted
                  trick!' Please!

                  Would you two fools shut the hell
                  up?


                  Sure, Shondra, sorry. You're on.
                  Go play good cop. We've gotta
                  call Tom.
     Shondra rolls her eyes and heads back into the room.


     Shondra enters.      Brad turns away.

                  You a'ight in here?

                  Oh yeah. I just been kidnapped,
                  carjacked, hands tied behind my
                  back, but other than that, it's
                  all good.


                  Look, I'm sorry about all that, it
                  wasn't my idea.

                  I thought you liked me.

                  I do.

                  Then how come you set me up?

                  I had to. They...
                          
                  ... they threatened to kill me if
                  I didn't play along.






                           
                   For real?

                   Oh yeah.   They straight-up killas.

                           
                   For Real?!

                   Lemme school you on something,
                   help you to stay alive, a'ight?
                   The one thing they hate more than
                   anything, that really sets them
                   off, is posers.

                   I feel you, girl, me too.

                   I'm talkin' 'bout you!

                   Me? But I hate posers! I got a
                   Ph.D. -- a Poser-Hater Degree.

                   Come on.   Quit frontin'.

                   I ain't fron'in'.

                   Listen to reason. If you just be
                   a nice little white boy and say
                   you're sorry, I think I can
                   convince them to let you go.

                   Damn. I am who I say I am. Why
                   won't anyone believe me? This is
                   a issue that's been comin' up a
                   lot in my life lately.


      Shondra exits, shakes her head "no" to Sean and PJ.






                   What's next?
      PJ refers to the itinerary they got from Tom.

                   How about... number three?

                   Yeah, perfect. Let's take it to
                   another level, my man.
      He and PJ "get into character" and head in.



      They enter and glare at Brad.

                   A'ight, we put the call in to yo
                   pops, and you know what he said?

                   Huh?

                   That he'd have to think about it.

                            
                   What?   Straight up?

                   He's not sure he wants you back,
                   cuz.

                   Can't see as I blame him.

                   Come on, y'all, quit hatin'.   I'm
                   just a rapper, that's it.

                   Wigga please!
      Sean cuts the duct tape with a blade.

                   Come on.






                   What you doin', fool?

                   I'ma teach this little white girl
                   a lesson!

                   No, dawg, stick to the plan. Lay
                   low here at the crib 'til we get
                   the ransom.

                   The plan just done changed, Tree.
                   Wannabe claims he down, I'ma show
                   him just how un-down he is.
      Sean yanks Brad out by his collar.





     Sean pulls in and parks in front of a small Korean
     grocery.

               A'ight, Malibu, go get us six 40s
               of O.E.

               And a fifth of Henny.
                       
               Anything else?

               I'd like some Pringles.


               This ain't a picnic, bitch!

               I'm sorry, I'm sorry... y'all got
               some duckets, 'cause I'm tapped.

               You about to go up in there and
               give this Korean bitch yo ends?
               Hell no.

               You jack that shit.

               And if the Asiatic gives you any
               static, show the brotha this...
     He hands Brad one of the prop guns -- a Glock.    It's
     heavier than Brad thought. He drops it.

               Little trick claims he down, can't
               even swing a gat.

               But...

               Do it, punk, or I'll use that on
               you.

               Okay, a'ight, I'll do it.






                  You try to get away, I'ma let you
                  get a little taste of my steel,
                  understand?
     He holds up his prop gun.

                  I feel you.
     Brad sticks the prop gun into his pants and gets out.        As
     soon as he's in the store, Sean and PJ burst into
     laughter.


                  This is gonna be classic.

                  He's gonna run out of there a
                  scared little white boy.
     They laugh again and pound it.



     Brad walks in, very nervous.       He looks back -- his car is
     parked so that PJ can see him      through the door. PJ
     smiles and shows him the gun      again. Brad swallows and
     approaches the counter. The       KOREAN GUY behind it watches
     him closely.

                  Yes?

                  Yeah, uh, where the Old English
                  at?

                  Back there, under security camera.

                  Thank you, sir.
     Brad hurries to the back of the store, and spots a door
     by the beer cooler. He tries to open it. It's locked.
     Brad looks up to the security mirror and sees that the
     Korean Guy is watching him. He moves to the beer cooler
     and tries to calm down.






                  Namyoho renge kyo, namyoho renge
                  kyo, namyoho renge kyo and
                  whatnot...
     It's not working. Brad tries a cleansing         breath. It
     doesn't help either. Brad gathers up an         armful of Old
     English 40s and heads for the front. The         Korean Guy
     watches him as he walks past the counter        toward the door.

                  Can I help you?

                  Naaw, but I'ma help myself to all
                  this O.E., and whatever else I
                  want!

                  No, stop.
     Brad drops the beer. It CRASHES to the floor in SLOW
     MOTION. Brad makes a crazy, threatening face as he pulls
     back a fist, but the Korean Guy throws a fast right hand,
     landing squarely on Brad's chin. Brad goes down like a
     sack of hammers; then we FLASHBACK TO:
     Moments earlier: We realize we've just been in a fantasy,
     as Brad again approaches the counter with his beer.

                  Can I help you?

                          
                  Let me axe you something.   Ever
                  been robbed?

                  Oh sure. Last week was my fifty-
                  fourth time. But they were cool,
                  no gun to head, never scream; you
                  know, good people.

                  Cool.
     He sets the 40s on the counter, then reaches into his
     waistband for his gun, and we...






                How much did you have to give this
                guy, anyway?

                What are you talking about?

                        
                When you set this thing up
                yesterday, what did you pay?

                I thought you set it up.


                You mean the owner doesn't know
                this is all fake?

                Oh damn.

                Get in there!    He could get shot!

                I'm not going in there!    You go in
                there!
      They continue to argue as we...




      Brad finishes reaching into his waistband for the Glock,
      but feels something else. He pulls out a small wallet
      that was Velcroed to his belt.

                My emergency stash.    Thank you
                God.
      He pulls out a hundred and kisses it.

                        
                Glad you got cash, 'cause if you
                try to jack me, I was gonna have
                to lay you out wid dis...





      He whips a .44 from under the counter and aims it at
      Brad.

                ... and wid dis.
      The Korean Guy's wife has an AK-47 on Brad, the red dot
      of its laser sight trained steadily in the middle of his
      forehead.

                   ... And wid dat.
      The Korean Guy's six-year-old boy has a sawed-off shotgun
      pointed at Brad's knees. The gun is bigger than the boy.
      The Koreans laugh at Brad. Brad drops the hundred on the
      counter.

                   Keep the change.

                           
                   Thank you very much. Come again.
      As Brad looks out to make sure PJ and Sean haven't seen
      anything, the Korean Guy sticks the receipt in between
      two of the 40s. Unaware, Brad gathers his stuff and
      heads to the door.

                   Uh, I know this is gonna sound
                   wack, but what I'm about to do is
                   just a joke, so don't shoot me,
                   okay?



      Sean and PJ, who are just running up to the door, watch
      stunned as Brad exits the store, pulling his gun out.

                   That's right! Next time I'll bust
                   a cap in yo trick ass!

                   Did he actually do it?

                   This can't be happening.






                           
                   Yeah. I'ma come back later and
                   get some more.
      Brad turns to the guys.

                   Let's dip!

                           
                   You did it?


                   Straight up.   Trick didn't do
                   nothin'.

                   Yo, what up with this?
      PJ pulls the receipt off of his 40.

                   If you jacked this, how come you
                   got a receipt?
      Brad freezes.     They both stare at him.

                   I stole that too!






      Bill and Tom lie facedown on matching massage tables,
      while massage therapists rapidly pound their backs.


      Tom is reading the itinerary through the face hole in his
      table. As the masseuses pound their backs, Tom and
      Bill's voices vibrate.






                  ... a meet and greet with
                  Greenpeace, then drinks with the
                  offshore oil lobby.


     face through hole.

                  Terrific.   How's the Brad project
                  doing?


                  Smooth... he's in South Central.

                  And he's okay?

                  He's in excellent hands.



     Sean, holding Brad by the shirt, slams him against the
     Escalade.

                  I've about had it, boy!

                  Who you callin' boy?

                  You got about five seconds to get
                  real, or I'ma Timbo stomp your ass
                  to de curb!

                  What do you mean, get real?!

                  Act your white self!
     He shoves a prop gun into Brad's ribs.

                  Five!   Four!






                          
                  Okay, a'ight, chill.
     Brad takes a deep sigh, looks them in the eye, and begins
     to talk like a conservative white guy.

                  I guess I now know I can never be
                  as cool as you guys. I promise I
                  will never, ever front or act like
                  a thug again, and I'm really
                  really sorry if I offended you.

     Sean and PJ move off to the side.

                  You buying it?

                  I can't tell.

                  Me either.

                  Let's give him the test.



     Brad, in the seats, eating popcorn non-stop. He is
     flanked by Sean and PJ... They both watch Brad, as he
     stares at the horror film play on the screen.

                          
                  You a'ight, man?
     Brad snaps out of it for a minute.

                          
                  Great, fine. Terrific popcorn.
     SCARY MUSIC    KICKS IN; Brad's eyes snap back to the
     screen. He     struggles to contain himself. The MUSIC
     INTENSIFIES,    we hear FOOTSTEPS, then a DOOR HANDLE
     TURNING, and    Brad can't hold on any longer. He leaps up,
     screaming...






                          
                  Run, bitch, ruuuuuuuuuuuuuun!!!
                  He gonna kiiiiiilllllll you!
     Other Patrons  turn and angrily "shush"
     Brad. Sean and PJ lock eyes: he failed the test.



     Sean and PJ are furious.     Brad is apologetic.


                  I'm sorry, y'all, but this is just
                  who I am. I'm a rapper straight-
                  up.

                  Wigga, please!

                  No, for real. I can rap about
                  anything.
                          
                  'Bloodbath and Tree, hang all day,
                  They real tight, but they ain't
                  gay... No, they okay...'

                          
                  You think you got mad skills, huh?
                  Well, we'll see about dat.



     Sean, PJ, and Brad approach the club.

                  I done had it with you, fool. You
                  better check yourself before you
                  wreck yourself. This ain't
                  Malibu!

                          
                  Represent.






                  Yeah, we gonna see what you
                  represent neeow. We at the club.

                  Cube, Snoop, they all came up
                  through here.

                  You want to prove yourself, this
                  the place to do it.
     They shove Brad into the club, then turn to each other
     and giggle like school girls.


                  This is definitely gonna do it.

                  Pay day!
     They pound and follow Brad into the club.









       Brad enters and takes in the club. Think 8 Mile.
       Hardcore GANGSTER TYPES and some tough HOME GIRLS check
       out rapper, DROP, whose ferocious, gravel-voiced raps
       show you exactly what kind of place you're in.

                    How you feelin' now, Malibu?


                    Finally, a place where I feel at
                    home.

                            
                    Get yo' ass in there.
       Brad boldly fist-shakes jaw-dropped patrons as he wades
       through the crowd, AD LIBBING "Whassup?" and "Pardon me,
       homey."


       DROP finishes and the MC brings up STEEL and YOUNG DRE,
       announcing the Battle Rap Competition. Steel and Young
       Dre battle -- both are top-notch. At every insult, the
       crowd ROARS.



       Shondra is    talking to a HOME GIRL, checking out the crowd
       below. She     suddenly sees Brad. She's eyes-wide
       horrified.     Steel finishes, the crowd CHEERS, and Young
       Dre starts    in on the mic.


       Sean and PJ leave Brad and fight through to the DJ table,
       where the MC is standing, timing Young Dre.
       Brad looks around, then up.     He sees Shondra and starts
       for the stairs.







                   Hey, girl.    Where you been?
      She turns and faces TEC, her ex-boyfriend, a no-nonsense
      roughneck gangbanger. He's very soft-spoken, almost
      expressionless.

                   None of your damn bizness, Tec.
                   Now let go.
      She yanks her arm away from him.


                   Y'all been busy, huh?

                   Too busy for you.

                   You been gettin' busy?

                   Hell no.

                   Come on, girl, I'm cool.    Just
                   tell me who it is.

                   All you need to know is that it
                   ain't you, okay?


                   You know, you ain't shit, Shondra.
                   You're just a chickenhead, and
                   that's all you'll ever be.
      Just then, Brad walks up, grinning like a fool.

                   What up, girl?!
      He gives her a sloppy kiss on the cheek.

                   You a'ight?






                   I'm fine, but you the finest!
                           
                   She a genius too, man! I'm
                   tellin' you, one she gets set up,
                   Mothra gonna blow up like Rosie
                   O'Donnell's head!

                   Don't tell me you been hittin'
                   that?
      She tries to pull away, but Tec holds on tight.


                   Damn, man. Don't you know how to
                   treat a lady? That's not nice.

                   Brad, don't --

                   It's cool, Shondra.      The brutha's
                   right.
      Tec releases Shondra's arm and immediately grabs Brad by
      the throat and hangs him over the balcony.

                   Didn't yo mama teach you to mind
                   you own bizness?

                           
                   Don't be hatin'.


                   Don't do it, Tec!

                   Auuuuuuuuu!
      Tec feels everyone looking at him. Now is not the time.
      He releases Brad and composes himself.

                   Y'all both gonna be sorry.
      Tec stalks off.

                   You alright?






                           
                   I'm okay. Who was that?

                   Old history.   Come on.
      Shondra grabs Brad and moves him to the stairs.


      Sean and PJ finally make it to the MC, who stands with
      the DJ.


                   Yo!
      Sean bumps the DJ table. A vicious look from the DJ, as
      Sean tries to play it off. The MC just looks at him
      disdainfully.

                   Uh... My boy want Young Dre next.
      The MC looks them over...

                   Hell, nah...

                   Maybe a C-Note would open some...
                   equal opportunities?

                           
                   What's his name?

                   B-rad.   From Malibu.
      The MC makes a face, but puts down Brad's name anyway.

                           
                   Hey playa... You got any Will
                   Smith back there?
      The MC just looks at him...








      Shondra hauls Brad down the stairs and stops near the
      entrance.

                Damn Shondra, where's the fire at?

                        
                You're going home.

                You settin' me free?

                No. I'm savin' your ass. I'm not
                havin' your blood on my hands.
                        
                It's the blue Honda across the
                street.



                A-ight y'all. Up next, to
                challenge Young Dre, we got... B-
                rad from Malibu.
      Looks of confusion, as the Crowd searches for "B-rad."

                Wait a second. Brad, don't do it.
      Brad turns to Shondra, looks at the keys, and shakes his
      head.


                Shondra, I gots to do 'dis. this
                is my shot. I gotta prove myself.
      Shondra can't argue. Brad starts to the stage. A WAVE
      OF SHOCK, as the crowd realizes who B-rad actually is.

                This is gonna be like an episode
                of 'Oz.'
      Brad gets his game face on and walks the gauntlet on his
      way to the stage -- an imposing path of intimidating
      looks.





      He is then dragged up onto the stage. He misinterprets
      the ANTAGONIZING CHANTS as encouragement and tries to
      high-five the crowd -- no takers. The MC and Young Dre
      laugh at him.

                   Nah, nah, nah... I ain't gonna
                   battle no bitch. What am I? Ike
                   Turner?
      The crowd LAUGHS.     Brad cluelessly laughs along with
      them.

                   A-ight, a-ight... We gotta do
                   this. Yo, Saltine... Heads or
                   tails?

                   Tizzaizzlszzs!
      Everyone is totally confused.

                           
                   Tails... I want tails.
      The MC flips and "tails" it is.

                   You wanna go first?

                   Nah... Ladies first.

      Brad LAUGHS, turning to the crowd to appreciate his lame
      burn... Nothing. Young Dre looks furious.
      Young Dre grabs the mic and the DJ spins. Young Dre
      proceeds to incinerate Brad. With every line, the crowd
      goes insane. 
      As Young Dre flows, Brad is visibly shaken, but tries to
      play it off -- not so discreetly scribbling notes on his
      hand and up his arm.
      Young Dre finishes with devastating blow, dropping the
      mic on the stage. The crowd goes wild...

                   Whooo... GOD DAMN! Now, let's see
                   if this Eminem melts in yo ass and
                   in your hand.





      The DJ kicks the beat and the MC throws Brad the mic. He
      misses it and it drills him in the forehead. The crowd
      LAUGHS. Brad tries to regain his composure...

                   Can we start again?   I lost my
                   place.
      TAUNTS and LAUGHS as the beat plays again. Brad wags his
      head, ready to come in strong. He looks down at his
      notes... He's sweating so badly his arm is a mess of
      runny ink.
      He freezes again... The crowd is really on him now --
      collectively making the "choke" sign.

                   I'm cool... I'm cool.
      Brad finally starts up.

                   'You big and rough,
                    You act all tough,
                    I bet in your childhood
                    You never had much love.
                           
                    Alert the media,

                    hardcore NIGGAA!!!

      Complete silence.

                           
                   Let's get the hell out of here.
      Brad looks around as blank faces stare back at him.

                   I'm sorry...
      The crowd erupts with outrage and rushes the stage.







      WAILS with terror as he's passed hand-over-hand above the
      CURSING CLUB PATRONS,  toward the
      exit.
      Four THUGS run Brad out of the back door, into the...


      ... where they launch him into the dumpster with a
      resounding THUD.

      Brad's landing causes the lid to SLAM violently shut, and
      forces Sean and PJ, who've been hiding behind it, to pop
      up.

                What was that?
      A RUMBLE comes from the dumpster and they pull back the
      lid.
      ANGLE ON: Inside the dumpster where Brad lies in the
      bottom -- his fall was broken by several loaves of old
      Wonder Bread.
      PJ and Sean fall into hysterics, as Shondra emerges from
      the club. She finds PJ and Sean apoplectic with
      laughter, shakes her head and begins to help Brad out of
      the dumpster.



      Tec watches it all going down.
      SNUFFY, 20, skinny but tough-looking chollo, and not a
      member of Tec's crew, is standing next to Tec.

                   You gettin' played, ese.

                   Excuse me?

                           
                   Loco boy hittin' your lady, homes,
                   and she's diggin' it.

                   Yeah, Snuffy, that's right.





     Tec starts to laugh, then suddenly his fist explodes into
     Snuffy's face. Snuffy drops, and Tec starts to stomp him
     until his boys, 8-BALL and DEUCE, pull him off.

                  Not here, Tec.

                  A'ight, y'all, let's roll.

                  Whatchoo wanna do?

                  Bag me a white boy.
     As they move toward the exit we...



     Sean and PJ are laughing uproariously. Brad walks in
     between them, devastated. Shondra's behind, looking
     bummed out as they head for the car.

                  Hey y'all, check this out. I can
                  rap about anything! Haaa!!

                  Word.
                          
                  'Listen, all you rappers, the
                  name's Brad Gluckman. When on the
                  mic you could say I really suck
                  man!'
     They burst out laughing. Brad just stares ahead,
     pouting, sick to his stomach.

                  A'ight, y'all had your fun, why
                  don't you chill...

                  'Cuz B-Rad G about to get ill!!!
     They burst out laughing again as they head for the car.






                   Damn. I haven't laughed like that
                   in a long time. 'Fess up, boy,
                   you can't hang.

                   I just want to go home.

                   Uhn uhn, ain't happening. By the
                   way, forgot to tell you. We heard
                   from your pops, and guess what?
                   He ain't payin'.


                   He thinks y'all belong down here
                   in the 'hood with us brothas,
                   seein' how you so 'down' and all.

                   So, I guess that means we got to
                   ice your punk ass.

                   I don't care no more. I got
                   nothin' to live for. Go ahead and
                   smoke me.
      Brad gets in the car. Sean and PJ look at each other --
      this isn't what they expected.






      
      Brad's lying on the bed, looking up dreamily.

                   Psst.   Hey, dawg.

                   Huh?

                   Down here, dawg.
      Brad looks over the edge of the bed.       A small gray RAT
      looks up at him.






                   Stuart Little?

                   Negro, pleeeze. That little white
                   rat ain't got nothin' on me -- yo,
                   I'm Ronny rizat, represizzat.

                   I ain't never seen no talking rat
                   before. Although at the Malibu
                   County Fair they had a chicken
                   that played tic tac toe. Man, I
                   hated losing to that chicken.


                   Why you so down, dog?

                   I'm a failure.

                   Nah, nah it's not like that. You
                   need to stop listening to what all
                   them perpetrators is running and
                   believe in yourself.

                   For real?

                   For riz-real.    Pound it.
      They punch it in.


                   So you saying if I put my mind to
                   it I can be whatever I want to be?

                   Damn straight.

                   I could be a highstylin' pimp?

                   They stylin-est.

                   I could drive a mad '63 El Camino
                   with 43-inch gold-plated dubs and
                   a trunk full o' bitches?



      MALIBU'S MOST WANTED - Rev. 1/29/03


                   You could have a roof rack full of
                   bitches. And some teeny-tiny
                   little bitches in the glove
                   compartment.

                   And I could be the biggest rapper
                   in the world.

                   Rapper? Hell no! You stink! I'd
                   rather eat garbage than listen to
                   your tired ass rhymes.
                           
                   Hmmm, garbage. That's making me
                   hungry. Peace out.
      The Rat runs off. Brad sighs, flops back down on the
      bed, utterly depressed.



      Brad lays on the bed, moonlit through the bars of the
      window. Shondra enters. Brad rolls over, away from her.

                   Hey...   You okay?
      Brad sniffles.

                   You know, it's not as bad as it
                   seems.






                  It's worse. Everybody's right.
                  My rhymes is weak.

                  You just need a little experience.

                  I should've run when you gave me
                  the chance.

                  Naw. You were right. I respected
                  you for getting' up there.


                  But you heard 'em laughing.   I
                  ain't nothin' but a busta.

                  They just don't understand you.
                  None of them know how hardcore it
                  is up in... Malibu.

                          
                  Yeah?

                  Yeah with the... traffic, and
                  the... parking, and...

                          
                  Like, when the public be all up in
                  your private beach?

                  Right. You just got to stick with
                  it, you know, don't let anyone
                  tell you who you are.
     Brad smiles, looks at her.

                  Thanks, Shondra.
                          
                  You know what I was sayin',
                  earlier, in the car, about being a
                  playa and all? Well... I was just
                  foolin'. I never been with a
                  sister before.






                          
                  For real?

                  Except for on the internet.

                  I never would've known.

                          
                  I think you about the finest girl
                  I ever met in my whole life, and,
                  well, since they gonna ice me in
                  the morning, I was wondering...
                  could I, kinda like, kiss you?
     She thinks, smiles, then sits down next to him on the
     bed. Brad sits up and looks at her face in the
     moonlight.

                  You're so pretty.

                  Thank you.
     Brad leans in and kisses her tenderly. She kisses him
     back. Encouraged, Brad opens his mouth wide and tries to
     stick his tongue down her throat. She pushes him back.

                  I said kiss, fool. Damn.

     She gets up and heads for the door.

                  I offered you a snack, not the
                  whole kitchen.

                  I'm sorry.   I'm sorry.   I'm chill.
     She rolls her eyes and leaves. Brad falls back on the
     bed, a dreamy smile on his face.

                  Totally chill.





     Tec, with his crew, drives up, lights out, and KILLS the
     ENGINE. He looks at the house with death in his eyes.


     Shondra exits the room and faces Sean and PJ.

               A'ight, that's it, this game is
               lame. I want my money, and then
               y'all can get out.

               But we're not done yet...

               You ain't never gonna be done.
               Did it ever occur to you two
               jackasses that this is the way he
               really is?

               No way.

               Not possible.

               Whatever. Look, I did what you
               asked, and I want my money.

               Okay, I'll get it, you know, but
               settin' everything up was
               expensive, and I don't exactly
               have it right now.

               Excuse me?   You playin' me?
     Shondra hands Sean the phone.

               Y'all get me my money now, or I'ma
               go in there and tell him what's
               up.

               Alright, okay, just relax...
     As Sean starts to dial, we --



thru                                                         thru




                 Yes, Sean. How's our little
                 project going?






                   Great, terrific, we're making real
                   progress here.


      Sean reads from the checklist Tom gave him.

                   Your suggestions were really
                   helpful. He totally bought the
                   car jack and kidnapping...



      Brad listens intently as Sean continues.

                   ... we staged a fabulous liquor
                   store robbery. Mr. Gluckman's
                   going to be very happy...
      Brad's eyes widen.

                   But, he's still posing, so we
                   wanted to put him in a drive-by
                   shooting next... but, it's a
                   little more money then our
                   original projections...
      Brad slumps back.     He can't believe it.




                   So I was wondering if I could get
                   an advance.

                   No deal. You get the rest when
                   Richie Cunningham steps through
                   the door here, and not one second
                   sooner, understand?

                   But -- Mr. Gibbons, hello?




      Brad crawls out from the vent and goes to the mirror.

                Damn... they been playin' me all
                along. How could dey do dat? How
                could she do dat?
                        
                What-ever. If them fools wanna
                play, then let's play.
      He heads for the door, bad-ass and hardcore.



      Suddenly, Brad's boot comes through the door. WOOD
      SHATTERS everywhere. Brad steps through with a furious
      look on his face. Shondra, Sean and PJ stare in shock.

                What the hell do you think you're
                doing?

                Hey! Listen up... Brad G is in da
                hiz, and things gonna start
                changin' round here!

                        
                Do something.

                You must be out yo mind. Get back
                in that room before I beat your
                ass!

                You feelin' froggy, den leap!
      Sean backs down.

                Anyone else wanna step?

                        
                What the hell got into you?

                Shut up, ho.






                  Who you callin' ho, ho?

                  Yo, ho, the same ho that gave up
                  that weak-ass kiss five minutes
                  ago in the bedroom.

                  Really?   Damn.

                          
                  Who the hell do you think you
                  are?

                  I'm B-Rad G, from 'Bu,
                  representin'! What y'all don't
                  realize is that I was tryin' to
                  put my mobbin' days behind me, but
                  rollin' with y'all done re-awoke
                  my inna killa. Let's start
                  droppin' bodies!
     Shondra, PJ and Sean watch, stunned, as Brad grabs a prop
     gun, his car keys and heads out.

                  Come on, girl. Let's go!

                  Uhn uhn. You created that
                  monster, you deal with it.


                  But we got big a problem here.

                  Until I see my money, it's your
                  problem.
     Sean and PJ exit quickly.



     Brad's at the car door as Sean and PJ exit and run up.






                  Where the hell you goin'?

                  I need to take a drive.

                  Come on, man.    Chill.

                  Today is a good day to die, didn't
                  have to use my A.K...
                          
                  Yey yey!


                  Why you talkin' crazy?

                          
                  Might as well go out in a blaze of
                  glory.  My daddy don't love me, my
                  rhymes is played. I ain't down
                  enough for y'all --

                           
                  No.   You down, right PJ, er, Tree?

                  That's right, Bloodbath, he's very
                  down. As down as they come.
     Suddenly, Tec jumps up, yanks Brad's door open and shoves
     a Nine in his side.


                  Oh my God.

                  Get out of the car, white boy.

                  Oh, you dat weak fuck from de
                  club.
     Tec can't believe what he's hearing.

                          
                  Got somethin' for me?






                          
                  Just this cap, fool! You ready to

                  just talkin' to my homies about

                  A'ight, but y'all should change up
                  your style, cuz these jackings is
                  gettin' tired.
     He heads for Tec's car.

                  Yo, Bloodbath, if there's one tiny
                  scratch on my ride, I'ma eat
                  y'all's children.
                          
                  Shotgun!

                  Tape up this fool's hole, man.
     A crew member yanks out some duct tape and tapes over
     Brad's mouth, then they throw him in Tec's trunk and slam
     it shut. Tec steps up to Sean and PJ.


                  What should we do with this
                  Bloodbath and his friends?

                          
                  I'm not Bloodbath! My real name
                  is Sean James, I'm an actor. I
                  swear!

                  Is Shondra hittin' the white boy?

                  No way, man. She's in on the
                  scam, just like us.






                  Scam?

                  Yeah. We're all being paid to
                  pretend to kidnap Bill Gluckman's kid.

                  Gluckman?   The dude runnin' for
                  Governor.

                  You've heard of him?


                  The dawg who's down with bitches
                  and hoes? Hell yeah, I've heard
                  of him. Just 'cause I live down
                  here you think I'm ignorant?

                  We didn't say that, brother.

                  A'ight then.
                          
                  Damn, we got Gluckman's son.
                  Fool's gotta be worth more alive
                  than dead.
                          
                  Let's roll.








     Tom and the campaign strategy team, Brett, Gary and Jen,
     are eating takeout, mid-meeting.

                  All the polls say that since
                  Brad's been out of the picture
                  we're up six points.






                  We're still dead in the urban
                  demo, though.

                  Gays too.

                  There's no way we can win without
                  them.
     The INTERCOM RINGS.

                  Yep?

                  I have a Sean on the phone for
                  you, sir.

                  Put it through.



     Sean is on a pay phone, terrified. Tec stands next to
     him. The Escalade and Tec's car are parked nearby.

                  Tom, we have a real problem.

                  I told you, no more money.

                  I know you said that, but we're in
                  real serious troub --
     Tec rips the phone out of Sean's hand.

                  Listen, fool. Gluckman's boy has
                  been kidnapped for real, along
                  with your punk friends.

                  Excuse me?






                  If Mr. Governor wants to see his
                  punk bitch son alive again I'm
                  gonna need five hundred grand by
                  tomorrow midnight.

                  How do I know this is real?

                  You think your actors are this
                  good?
     Tec puts the phone up to Sean.


                  Help us, please...
                          
                  I'm...
                          
                  so...
                          
                  Scared!!!
     Sean begins to wail.      Tec yanks the phone back.

                  Okay, I'm convinced.

                  Good.   Now get me my money.

                  Fine... Please don't do anything
                  until I talk to Mr. Gluckman and
                  arrange the finances.

                  You got ten minutes.
     Tec hangs up.

                  Now what?

                  We wait.
     Behind, no one notices as a low rider cruises by
     slowly.




     It's Snuffy, his face swollen and bloody from the beating
     he took from Tec. He's with two of his homeboys, members
     of the Rollin' G gang, checking out Tec and the crew.

               Is that him, ese?

               Yeah, that's Tec, homes, from the
               I-9's.

               Call Cyco, tell him to bring it
               all. We gonna have a party.

     The homeboy works his cell, as we:



     Tom stands there with the phone in his hands, shaken.

               What the hell's going on?

               Brad's been kidnapped for real.

               What?

               They want five hundred grand or
               they'll kill him.

               Oh my God.

               Now let's not panic. Lemme just
               think this through for a minute.
               We could have a very interesting
               opportunity here.

               Where are you going with this?

               Well, the negatives are obvious.






                  Bill drops out of the race,
                  emotional distress...

                  I can handle Bill. Let's
                  brainstorm the positives.

                  There's so many. No more 'Brad
                  problem.'

                  Right, right, I'm liking it.

     They start riffing on the idea, getting excited.

                  With a dead son, the sympathy
                  factor could give us big spike in
                  the female and gay demos.

                  We've had such a problem with
                  Bill's rich guy image, we could
                  spin the issue to make him more
                  'Everymen,' you know, 'crime
                  touches everyone,' like that.

                  What about a voter backlash, like
                  how could he run on the heels of a
                  tragedy?

                  No -- we push the 'courage under
                  adversity' angle.

                  Helps with his leadership profile.

                  Bill Gluckman, crusader/martyr...

                  I've got the image -- Bill weeping
                  over Brad's open casket.

                  Then, after grieving
                  appropriately, he goes on the
                  offensive...






                  Bill Gluckman's war on crime...

                  ... drugs.

                  ... gangs.

                  War's hot now.

                  War's great.


                  It's just what we've needed.

                  It's like a green light to
                  Sacramento.

                  Next stop, the White House.
     The PHONE RINGS and Tom picks up.



     Tec is on the phone.

                  What up?

                  No deal.

                  Say what?

                  Bill Gluckman does not make deals
                  with criminals.

                  That's it, then, fool. I ain't
                  playin'. His ass is done.






                   You do what you have to do, and
                   we'll do what we have to do.
      He hangs up and smiles.


      Tec hangs up; as he looks over, Brad is pulled from the
      trunk by two I-9s, his mouth still taped. Tec almost
      feels sorry for him.

                   That's cold.
                           
                   Lose the tape.
      Tec's homie rips the tape off Brad's mouth.

                   God damn that hurts!!! I get out
                   of this I'ma hafta teach y'all
                   some manners!

                   Your daddy ain't payin'.

                   Yeah, yeah, tell me somethin' I
                   don't know!

                   What?


                   You heard me, you half-steppin'
                   moist-ass bitch!
      Tec cocks his nine and aims at Brad.

                           
                   Oh what, you gonna do me like
                   this? A'ight, then bring it.

                   It's brought.

                   Man up! Put this wannabe out of
                   his misery.





      Tec is stunned -- the white boy isn't showing any fear.
      Brad steps forward, puts the gun to his own heart, and
      places his thumb on the trigger.

                   That gat's real, right?    Then do
                   it or I'll do it myself

                           
                   Brotha straight-up crazy, and I
                   cannot deal with that shit.
      Suddenly GUNFIRE erupts as Tech's car is HIT with a
      BARRAGE of BULLETS. Brad, the crew, Sean and PJ drop to
      the street and roll under the car. Tec has to dive
      behind a nearby dumpster.


      Snuffy and three Rollin' G's are crouched behind their
      low rider, FIRING away.


      The I-9s RETURN FIRE. PJ and Sean are in the fetal
      position, freaking out. Brad, thinking it's all fake, is
      laughing, having a great time.

                   Lay down some cover, fool!
      Tec's pinned down behind the dumpster. He's without
      a weapon, and Rollin' G's are FOCUSING their FIRE on
      him.

                   We're tryin', man, but they're too
                   strapped.

                   What the hell we gonna do?

                   Punks.   Gimme dem gats.
      Brad grabs the Uzis and rolls out from under the
      car.






                   Y'all wanna play? Let's play!
                   You know who you're dealin'
                   with???
      He jumps up on the hood of Tec's car and OPENS FIRE with
      both Uzis, laying down a withering rain of lead.

                   I'm B-Rad G, from the 'BU,
                   y'all...

                   Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!
      The Rollin' G's try to respond, but Brad's fire is too
      intense.

                   Devil's got some balls.

                   For real!   Let's dip!
      They all hop in their convertible and tear-ass out of
      there as Brad jumps off the cars and follows on foot,
      FIRING after them as they turn the corner and SQUEAL
      away.


                   It's safe now, y'all.
      Tec emerges from behind the dumpster. The crew rolls out
      from under the car, followed by Sean and PJ. They look
      at Brad in awe. They're impressed.

                   That was ill!    Y'all definitely
                   got juice.
      He offers his fist to Brad.        They pound.

                   Where'd you learn that shit?

                   Damn.   Jus' MTV.









     HAL FISHMAN reads the night's news.

               Good evening. A Channel Five
               exclusive. A security camera
               captured incredible footage of
               gang violence tonight, as it flared
               on the streets of South Central.






     of Brad, on top of Tec's car, FIRING the UZIS.

               This hardcore gangster, believed to
               be the notorious 'White Kong,' leader
               of I-9 street gang, fires his weapons
               with wanton disregard for human life
               or personal property.



     in SLOW MOTION as he FIRES.

               whereabouts of this man, call our
               hot line at 1-555-GANG.



     They sit in bed, stunned.

               Oh...





      She's on the couch, blocking a wig, stunned.

     Bill storms in. Tom quickly switches OFF the TV.          The
     staffers move aside as Bill confronts Tom.

                  Bradley's been involved in a gang
                  shooting.

                  Are you positive?

                  His face was on the news, Tom!   I
                  think I know my own son!

                  I'm sure there's a logical
                  explanation. Why don't you get
                  some sleep --

                  Sleep? He's shooting the hell out
                  of South Central. We've got to
                  get him!

                  What about the debate tomorrow in
                  Sacramento --

                  Forget the debate!

                  If you cancel, you can kiss this
                  campaign good-bye.






                  You can shove the campaign up your
                  ass, Tom! I will not lose my son
                  over this election!

                  I understand you're upset, Bill,
                  but Jesus, for once in your life
                  think outside the box! We can
                  make Brad's whole gang thing a
                  positive...

                          
                  A positive!

                  If he's arrested or, God forbid
                  injured, we spin it so you are the
                  victim, you know, 'crime reaches
                  everyone,' something like that...

                  You're trying to get votes out of
                  this?

                  I'm trying to win, Bill, and you
                  don't seem to care!

                  I'm his father.

                          
                  When did that happen?

                  I guess right now.
     Bill grabs Tom by the shirt and slams him into the wall.

                  You're fired.
     As Bill takes off:

                  All right, guys, let's pitch on
                  how I get my job back.
     They just stare at him.






                  Guys?

                  Just so you know, I never liked
                  the way you ran things around
                  here.
                          
                  Bill? Mr. Gluckman?
     The other staffers follow Brett out, leaving Tom alone.




     Bill hauls-ass down the 405, his headset on.

                  This is Lojack.

                  I need a location on license number...
                          


                  That vehicle is at the corner of
                  McKinley and 82nd.


     Suddenly a map of South Central appears, with a red
     blinking dot at the corner of McKinley and 82nd.



                  Your destination is a Lojack
                  designated danger zone. Lojack
                  does not recommend you venture
                  into this area.
     RAP BLASTS IN as Bill punches the gas, as we:





      A party is happening: Homies slam dominoes... Home girlz
      drink beer and talk... Sean and PJ are standing frozen in
      a corner, quietly crying... Hip-hop gangsters dancing...
      and finally we FIND Tec and the other I-9's gathered
      around Brad, as Tec solemnly hands Brad a Tec 9 automatic
      pistol.

                That's yours, B.

                For real?   You shouldn't have.

                Welcome to the 9's.     Only way out
                now, is in a box.

                In a box... right.
      Brad laughs.   They all join in, laughing hard as we --



      Mocha, Hadji and Monster stand by Hadji's dad's Mercedes.

                A'ight, Monster, what kind of
                toast you strappin'?

                        
                This.
      Monster pulls a scuba divers' spear gun from the bag.

                What the hell is it?

                My pop's spear gat. From the
                yacht.
      Mocha laughs and starts doing whale sounds.

                A'ight Free Willy, think you so
                bad, what you got?






                          
                  Never mind.
     He puts an old musty case in the car and starts to close
     the doors. Hadji stops him.

                  Come on, let's see it.

                  A'ight, a'ight, chill.
     He opens the case, revealing an antique blunderbuss
     musket, with a flintlock hammer and a bell muzzle.

                  Is that a freakin' musket?

                  What?  My pops is a collector.
                          
                  Come on, man, pirates used that
                  shit.
     Monster grabs the musket and points it at Mocha.

                          
                  Aargh, matey, give up yer treasure
                  or I'll bust me harpoon in yer
                  booty.
     Monster and Hadji start laughing.


                  Shut up!   Damn posers!
     He snatches the musket from Monster and carefully places
     it back in the case.

                  Hadji, how 'bout you?

                  Couldn't get much, yo...
     Hadji opens a duffel and pulls out three Kevlar vests.

                  When I told my pops we was going
                  on a drive-by, he gave me three of
                  these.






                  Good thinking, but what heat you
                  got?
     He opens a plastic case, revealing a Stinger rocket
     launcher and four missiles.

                  ... dis.
     Mocha and Monster are blown away.

                  Dang!   Where'd you get all dat?


                          
                  Christmas present from Uncle
                  Ahmet.



     Mocha, Hadji, and Monster snap on their seat belts.
     Hadji flips on the in-dash SOS Mercedes GPS system.

                  Yes, Mr. Amiraslani, can I help
                  you?

                  Hell yes, chicken. I need a
                  location on license number D-








     The party is now in full effect, the system up and
     cranked as the CAMERA FINDS Brad's in the middle of the
     dance floor, freaking and doing the robot with a couple
     of sisters. The girls whisper in his ear, he smiles, and
     they head for a bedroom.





     Just as they exit, Shondra enters from the kitchen, and
     finds Sean and PJ, still tied up and terrified.

                  Where's Brad?

                          
                  I haven't seen anything.
     She moves on.     PJ lifts up his bound wrists.

                  Shondra!   Little help, please.

     But she's gone.


     Brad's on the bed with the two women, who are kissing
     him.

                  Yeah, I just got tested positive
                  ... for G.A.M.E.

                          
                  Cool playa.

                  Let's get busy.
     They laugh when suddenly Shondra comes through the door.


                  That's the same damn line he used
                  on me, and now this no good
                  deadbeat weak-ass white boy won't
                  take care of little Malik.

                  What?!

                          
                  You know he's yours...

                  This gettin' heavy.






                  Let's jet.
     The girls leave.

                  Damn, why you throwin' salt on my


                  I'm savin' your lily-white ass.
                  Come on.

                  I ain't goin' nowhere. I'm a I-9
                  neow, straight-up. Peep my tat.
     Brad lifts his shirt and shows her the tattoo on his
     stomach: I-9 THUG.

                          
                  Listen, fool.

                  Shut up, Shondra! I know y'all
                  set me up, I know it's all fake,
                  de kidnap, de stickup, de whole
                  nizzy.

                  Oh, damn...

                  Why'd you play me, huh?


                  For the money.

                                    What you need money
                  Money?!   Tch.
                  for?

                  Look, fool, this may sound stupid
                  to you, but not everybody has
                  money, and to people that don't,
                  money is important!

                  Please. You prob'ly still
                  flippin' me anyway, so --






                  Dammit, Brad, this is real.   Tec
                  and his crew are real --

                  Oh really? Well if Tec is real
                  then this gat must be real...
     Brad pulls his nine.

                  And if this gat is real then the
                       in it have got to be real.
                  caps
                  And seein' how my foot is real,
                       this would really hurt...
                  then
     Brad aims at his foot and pulls the trigger and BLAM!          He
     puts a BULLET through the toes of his sneaks.

                  See dat. I just shot myself in
                  the foot and...
                          
                  It's reaaaaalll! It's totally
                  reaaaaalll!!!
     Brad starts hopping around the room.

                  I just shot my foot!!   I just shot
                  my foot!!!

                  Stop hoppin' around, fool, so I
                  can look at it.






     Shondra gets down on her knees to get a closer look.

                  Oh gaawwwd!

                  Lucky you're such a weak shot.
                  Cap just grazed your toe.

                  But, it's real, Shondra, it's all
                  reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeal!
     Tec enters, gun in hand.


                  Who's the hell's poppin' ca --


     Shondra, on her knees, kneeling before Brad.



                          
                  What up, cuz?
     Shondra stands quickly, scared.

                          (terrified,
                           covering)
                  Ha ha, Tec, my road dawg, yeah,
                  just the man I wanta see.

                          
                  What's goin' on, Shondra?

                          
                  It's not what it looks like, Tec,
                  I swear.

                  Don't you lie to me. That was
                  always my line to you, and it
                  always was what it looked like.
                  Now what's up with your boyfriend
                  here.






                  Yo, dawg, love to kick it wit' you
                  and run the whole thizang, but I
                  got some bidness back in the 'Bu,
                  li'l somethin' somethin' with Big Boy
                  and whatnot, so if y'alls don't mind --

                  I do mind.
     Tec grabs Brad and drags him out.

                  No, Tec, stop!



     Tec hauls Brad in, followed by Shondra. The I-9s draw
     weapons; the room fills with tension. Sean and PJ look
     on, getting caught up in the action.

                  Wait, Tec, lemme explain, 'cause I
                  don't belong here...

                  You done forgot already, fool? I
                  told you the only one way out of
                  the I-9s, and your 'E' ticket's in
                  this here chamber.
     Tec cocks his gun.






     watching Tec, riveted.

                  See how committed he is? That's
                  the rage I was talking about.

                          
                  Word.



     Tec aims at Brad.

                  Please, don't be hatin'.
     Shondra steps in front of Brad.

                  I won't let you do it, Tec.

                  No problem, then.   I'll just do
                  the both of you.
     Tec levels the barrel at Shondra and Brad. He starts to
     squeeze the trigger when suddenly Bill's HUMMER CRASHES
     through the wall. I-9's scatter and duck as the Hummer's
     front grill skids to a stop inches from Tec. The
     driver's door pops open and Bill jumps out.


                  Damn fool!   You just hit my house!

                           
                  Brad!   Are you okay?

                  Not really. And unless you
                  seriously strapped, you about to
                  be not really okay too.
     Bill turns:     six I-9s are aiming guns at he and Brad.

                  Hey there, fellas. Bill
                  Gluckman... I'm running for
                  governor.






                  We know who you are, fool.

                  You the candidate that's down with
                  bitches and ho's.

                  Tsss. Dude think we ignorant just
                  'cause we live down here. You
                  better recognize.

                  I absolutely recognize that street
                  violence is tearing Californians
                  apart... You see, guys, California
                  is my family, and hey, here's a
                  thought. Instead of thinking of
                  ourselves as what set we're from,
                  or what crew we're rolling with,
                  why can't we just be brothers?
                  What do you say?

                          
                  Hmmm. I guess I never looked at
                  it like that before. What do you
                  say, 'brothers'?
     The I-9's smile, cock their weapons, aim them, and just
     as they're about to start blasting, the side WALL
     EXPLODES and Hadji's dad's MERCEDES CRASHES through.

                  Don't anybody know where the
                  driveway's at?! Damn!
     Gangsters fall back as Hadji, Mocha, and Monster jump out
     wearing the Kevlar vests and wielding their weapons.

                          
                  Better step, y'all, or I'ma have
                  to waste all y'all up in this
                  piece!

                  Yeah!   Drop yo gats!
     The I-9s, unafraid, point their guns right back at Hadji,
     Monster and Mocha. It's a multi-player Mexican standoff.






                  Drop your gats!
     Nobody does.     Brad steps out.

                  Hold dup, y'all. Before anybody
                  ices anybody I got to say something.
     No one stops him, so Brad turns to his dad.

                  You really weren't gonna pay my
                  ransom?


                  I didn't know anything about that.
                  You've got to believe me, that was
                  not part of the plan.

                  What was the plan? Send me down
                  here to scare me white?

                  It was stupid, I know. I thought
                  I'd tried everything... I just
                  didn't know how to deal with you
                  anymore.

                  You've never known how to deal
                  with me 'cause you don't know me,
                  and you never cared to find out.
                  And now that your election's on
                  the line, that's when you take a
                  stand? That's bullshit, Pops.
                  Look at me, 'cause this is who I
                  am, and if you can't accept that,
                  then I'll walk out that door,
                  never see your sorry-ass again.
     Shondra, Tec, all the I-9's and Brad's posse slowly turn
     from Brad to Bill, completely caught in the moment,
     waiting for his response.

                  I'm not proud of myself, Brad. I
                  made a lot of mistakes, and I know
                  I wasn't there for you, and I
                  can't change that, but I always
                  loved you and still do...







                  ... and if you say this is really
                  who you are, then I believe you
                  and accept you, and from here on
                  in, I promise to be a real father
                  to you.

                  Talk is cheap, Pops.    Prove it.

                  I'm here, ain't I?
     Brad looks at him.        Bill looks back.   Everyone looks on,
     riveted.

                  A'ight, Pops, we cool.

                  Much love.
     They pound.


     getting emotional.        A couple sniffle, a few wipe their
     eyes.

                          
                  Wish I could talk to my pops like
                  that.


                          
                  No doubt. He's raising his kid.

                          (dialing his cell,
                           wiping tears)
                  I'ma call my pops right now.

                  Would y'all get a hold of your
                  fool selves?! It's time to waste
                  these punks!
     The I-9s straighten up and re-aim their guns.






                          
                  Tec, before we all go out in a
                  blaze of glory, can I say one last
                  thing?

                          
                  Whatchya got to say?

                  Moch, kick it freestyle.
     Mocha rests the musket in the crook of his arm, and does
     his human beat box thing as Brad begins to rap.

                  'What's up with all this fightin'?
                  We all should be unitin'!
                  Y'all egos need deflatin',
                  Gangstas, please, quit all this
                    hatin'.'

                  Stop, please! If I hear you drop
                  one more rhyme, I'ma hafta smoke
                  myself.

                  A'ight, cool, but all these gats
                  got to go!
     As Brad grabs the missile launcher from Hadji...

                          
                  Word up, B. All this hatin' is
                  wack!
     Mocha slams the butt of the musket down, and the
     flintlock slams forward. Everyone cringes. Nothing
     happens. Everyone looks at the MUSKET, then suddenly it
     EXPLODES and a rusty musket ball FIRES OUT, slamming
     Monster in the middle of her Kevlar breastplate. She
     flies back and slams into the wall, causing her spear gun
     to fire -- a SPEAR SHOOTS OUT and lands directly into
     Brad's left ass cheek. Brad howls and drops the MISSILE

     SLOW MOTION:     everyone watches it fall to the ground...
     REAL TIME:     it hits the floor and the MISSILE FIRES.





     Brad... Tec... Bill... and Shondra all watch in horror as
     the missile flies past gang members, through the kitchen
     door, and slams into the side of the gas oven. We hear a
     countdown BEEP BEEP BEEP...

                  Ruuuuuuunnnnn!
     Everyone runs for the nearest hole in the wall.


     Bodies stream out of the house scrambling for safety when
     suddenly...
     The HOUSE BLOWS in a huge orange FIREBALL...



     We CRANE PAST emergency vehicles parked in front of
     smoldering remains of Tec's house, then MOVE TO Tec, who
     is yelling at a cop.

                  I know my rights, man, and
                  these fools drove two damn
                  cars into my house, then they
                  blew the shit up! This all
                  better be rebuilt before my
                  ma comes back, or she will
                  make you wish you were never
                  born.
     CLOSE ON a FEMALE TV REPORTER speaking TO CAMERA.

                  I have two witnesses who were at
                  the scene of the explosion...
     She turns and the CAMERA WIDENS to include Sean and PJ;
     their clothes are singed and still smoking.

                  Can you tell us what happened?






                  It was hard core, yo. All these
                  crazy busters was strapped to the
                  nines, and I was like, keepin' the
                  peace, telling the brothers to
                  talk it out, find their common
                  bond...
     Sean steps in front of PJ, speaking directly INTO CAMERA.

                          
                  See, the explosion was   just a
                  metaphor for the anger   we
                  oppressed young men of   color have
                  buried deep inside our   hearts...
                  hearts turned dark --

                          
                  Okay, thank you, Bloodbath and

                  And all of this mayhem is rumored
                  to have been caused by the
                  mysterious White Kong, who remains
                  at large. This is Soon Yi Baxter-
                  Hernandez, reporting from South

                  When's this gonna air?

                  Can I get a copy of this?     I need
                  it for my reel.
     She glares and they move off... We FIND Brad and Shondra
     by an ambulance, talking as a paramedic bandages Brad's
     ass.

                  Aaah!!!






                  You alright?

                  I'm cool... still a little
                  confused maybe. I'm still not
                  exactly sure what was for real and
                  what wasn't.

                  Well, as far as being real, I can
                  only vouch for two things.
     She kisses him full on the lips.


                  I can deal with a little more of
                  that reality.
     They kiss again, then Brad breaks it.

                  Wait a minute. You said two
                  things was real. What was the
                  other?
     Shondra smiles as we...



                  What up, Shondra?




     It's an incredibly foofy Baroque nightmare.

                  Damn, you knew Big Boy the whole
                  time?

                  I told you we go way back.

                  So Shondra tells me you drop
                  rhyme.

                   I can't wait, y'all. Peace.

      Big Boy pounds Brad and they exit. Big Boy hands the CD
      to a British butler, who puts it in the system. Big Boy
      puts on the headphones and the butler hits play. Big Boy
      listens for a minute, then smiles.

                   I know exactly what to do with
                   this.







      Big Boy stands there in his bathrobe.


                   Pull!
      Brad's CD flies into the sky like a skeet clay pigeon.
      Big Boy raises a GLOCK and BLOWS it to kingdom come.



      Brad and Shondra stand off to the side of a huge rally.

                   Damn. Twenty thousand people, all
                   here to support my pops. He must
                   have charisma.

                  thank you.

                  For what?

                  You the only one who accepted me

                  You also car jacked me, kidnapped
                  me and tried to turn me white, but
                  I'm gonna let that go.
     They kiss, tongues and all as Bill walks up.

                  Hey, kids... Sorry to interrupt.

     Shondra looks on proudly as MUSIC -- heavy on emotional
     strings, swells, driving the movie audience to feel as
     good as they've ever felt in a movie. Brad takes the
     stage.

     Brad raises Bill's hand up in victory and we FREEZE.





     SUPERIMPOSE: Brad did deliver the urban vote... to
     Bill's opponent. Bill Gluckman lost the election by a
     landslide.

     their talents...
     We WIDEN to reveal Sean and PJ in uniform and working at:

                  Welcome to Wienie In A Bun.

                  How about a Double Dog?
     Tom leans in, with a "Manager" nametag, whispering
     angrily:

                  Push the Mega Meal, or you punks
                  are so fired.

     SUPERIMPOSE: Tec sued Bill Gluckman, and was awarded 100
     thousand dollars for damage to his house, and another

      SUPERIMPOSE: While waiting for his rap career to kick
      in, Brad invested his trust fund into a business that
      made sense.
      We CRANE DOWN FROM a sign that reads: "GRAND OPENING,
      SHONDRA'S NAIL AND BEAUTY SALON" to reveal a crowd of
      Malibu women gathered around Brad and Shondra as Shondra
      cuts a ribbon with a huge pair of scissors; the women
      rush inside.

                   I helped Shondra open up her salon
                   right here in the 'Bu.


      Shondra puts the finishing touches to a woman in a chair.

                   Malibu so they were stone-cold
                   ghetto fabulous.
      Shondra spins the chair to REVEAL: BEES GLUCKMAN with a
      crazy ghetto hairstyle. She looks like Busta Rhymes.
      She checks herself in the mirror.

                   I love it.

                  have a live report from the
                  celebration at Gluckman
                  headquarters...
     PUSH IN TO the news monitor over Hal Fishman's shoulder,
     to...



     CHEERS, as Bill takes the mic (As he speaks, we SLOWLY
     PULL BACK, gradually revealing the people next to him on
     stage).

                  This is a monumental day for our
                  glorious state and there are
                  several people I need to thank
                  here tonight...
                          
                  There's the International
                  Brotherhood of Police Officers...
     APPLAUSE, as POLICE OFFICERS salute Bill.

                  The Southern California Rotary
                  Club...
     A table full of well-dressed PROFESSIONALS wave politely.


                  And our friends at the
                  Environmental Defense Fund...
     A group of granola-type ENVIRONMENTALISTS smile.
     Brad CLEARS HIS THROAT, causing Bill to look at him.
     Brad gives Bill a "reminder" nod...

                  Oh, and of course...
     PULL BACK TO REVEAL:     We're actually in the PROUD BIRD...

                          
                  ... all the Bitches and Ho's...





     A pod of SKANKY WOMEN snap their fingers in Bill's
     direction.

                  The Pimps... The Hoodrats...
     The lavishly-dressed PIMPS raise their canes to Bill.

                  The Association of Korean Grocers.
     An ASIAN FAMILY give Bill the "thumbs-up."

                  The Playas. The Ballers. The
                  Shot Callers. And a special shout
                  out to the I-9's.


     and his gang.     They wear dark suits and do rags.

                  And... The Women's Organization of
                  California.
     A table full of prim ELDERLY LADIES golf-clap and smile.

                  And most of all, I'd like to thank
                  my campaign advisor on urban
                  affairs, and my son, B-rad G.
     APPLAUSE as Brad grabs the mic at the podium.


                  West Coast Reprezzizzin'!
     Bill and Brad hug.
     HIP HOP MUSIC KICKS IN and the entire       Ballroom turns into
     one huge dance party. Bill raises the        roof as he
     meanders into the celebrating crowd.        People of all
     different races and backgrounds dance       together, all
     having a blast...
     Hadji grinds on an ELDERLY CONSTITUENT's ass... she's
     into it.

                  I'm totally taxing your ass.





     Bess compares her diamond ring to Tec's Bling-Bling.

                  You get that from Tiffany?

                  I think that was the Bitches'
                  name, yeah...
     They continue to marvel at each other's decorative
     accessories...



     We see Sean and PJ are caterers, wearing "Wiener on a
     Bun" outfits/hats and circulating among the guests.
     They approach a well-to-do PARTYGOER.

                  Would you care for a wiener?
                  Courtesy of Wiener on a Bun.

                  Or perhaps I can interest you in a
                  head shot? I'm trained in jazz
                  dance, tap, and I can do a
                  Southern accent.
     Tom enters wearing a "Wiener on a Bun" manager's outfit.

                  Idiots. What did I tell you about
                  bothering the guests? Now move
                  it, those wieners aren't serving
                  themselves.
     He pushes them out of there.

                  Yo, yo, yo...
     Everyone turns to see Brad still at the podium.
     Confusion...

                  Last time I was here, y'all threw
                  my ass out. But now that I haves
                  yo attention, I gots somethin' I
                  gotta say... And I have to do it
                  the only way I know how... Kick
                  it, Moch.





      TEETH RATTLING BASS THUNDERS, as Brad pulls the mic out
      of the stand and begins prowling around the stage.
      
      SLOW MOTION:     Panic, as everyone realizes Brad is about
      to rap...

                   I wrote this one just for you,
                   Dad.
                           
                   Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah,
                   yeah... Yeah...
                           
                   I'm sorry, I lost my place again.
                           
                   Oh, here we go...
                   Election, erection,
                   I got an infection.
                   My pops, he won,
                   Defying all the pre-dections...
      Sean and PJ  drop their serving trays; Tec and
      the I-9's dive for Brad at the podium; Shondra screams,

      Brad is grabbed and thrown off the stage by the I-9's and
      is projected out over the audience, where we...
      FREEZE ON:     Brad's terrified face.

                           
                   What can I say, ain't nothing but
                   a thang...

      UNFREEZE and Brad falls to the ground.



                   After months of searching the
                   Southland for notorious criminal
                   White Kong, the LAPD has finally
                   made an arrest. The suspect, a
                   black man, was caught earlier
                   today...
      Footage of a BLACK MAN being put in a squad car.






                   'White Kong'?    Damn! I'm not even
                   white.

                   That's what they all say.
                           
                   Shut up, White Kong.
