    CLINKING GLASSES and other assorted BAR SOUNDS.


              Let's give a hand to Rodney!

    Scattered APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER.


              Next up, we've got a little lady
              named...KATE!

    Joyful APPLAUSE.


              Yeah, Kate!










    CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and,     *
    oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny



    in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar.

    Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke
    version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent
    she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm.

    At a table near the stage is --

    -- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      *
    handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps
    and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with --

    -- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       *
    who sings along with --

    -- the small but energetic CROWD.

    Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points
    to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the
    Queen of Karaoke.





Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to
join Charlie and Owen.


          That was so good, baby!


          Bullshit.


          I'm serious. You sing like an angel
          -- a drunk angel.

Owen and Kate LAUGH.


          If you were writing about my
          performance for your blog, what
          would you say?


          I'd say that, uh...my wife is the
          sexiest, most amazing woman alive.


          That would be such a shitty article
          -- nobody would read it.

Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at
Owen and makes a puppy dog face.


              
          Aw...we need to find you a lady,
          Owen.


          Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt
          with the bartender, but...I can't
          tell.

Owen motions to the --

-- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20's.                                *


          She's hot! What can't you tell?


          She looks like she could kick my
          ass. No way would she go for a guy
          like me.




          You're being a little girl -- just
          go talk to her.


              
          I don't know...forget about it.


              (not going to take "no"
               for an answer)
          I'll take point -- follow me.

Kate stumbles to the bar. Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts
her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender.


          I want to buy a gimlet for me and a
          double-shot of whiskey for my
          brother-in-law `cause he's had a
          hard week.


          `Kay.

The bartender quickly pours the drinks.


          That's fifteen.


          Wait -- don't you wanna know what
          happened to him?

The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see
if there are other customers. It's pretty dead -- so she
listens.


              
          What happened?


          He just got back from England --
          because he went there for a girl! A
          preppy, bitchy girl. Diane
          Court...that was her name. He loved
          her so much that he went with her
          because she had a fellowship or
          something. He gave up being a
          kickboxer. A kickboxer!                               *
              
          And she dumped him.



The bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation
to hear her response, which is --


              
          You kickbox?


              
          Yeah.

And...that's all Owen's got.


              
          And he teaches kids at the
          kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so
          cute!

The bartender glances back to Owen.


              
          A lot of `em don't have parents --
          so...it's kinda more than just a
          teacher/student thing.
              
          I know it sounds silly, but I feel
          responsible for them -- like...
              
          ...I could be their parent.

Kate slides down the bar to Charlie.


              
          I think I got him laid.


          Yeah?


          She seems totally game.


          Sure she just didn't want to get
          into your pants?

Kate rolls her eyes.


          I think I'm done for the night.




          Yeah?

Owen wanders over, dejected.                         *


          She's seen "Say Anything."


          Eh, well...what're you gonna do,
          huh?
               
          Wanna drive us home?


          No -- he needs to keep working it!         *
          You guys stay here.


          I don't want to watch my brother
          not score. I want to go to bed with
          you and...
              (whispered into Kate's
               ear)
          ...you know.


          I'll be home when you get there. We
          can "you know" then.


              
          Yeah, man -- you don't have a job
          to wake up for in the morning or
          anything.


          Writing is a job! Not having to
          report to an office only makes work
          harder.
              
          Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen
          should take us home -- you're too
          drunk to drive.


          So's Owen.
              
          I'm not that drunk. Besides, you
          know I focus when I drive -- it
          sobers me up.


          Tell that to the cops.



    Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen.


                  
              I love you, baby. I'll be waiting
              for you in a nice warm bed. You
              have exactly one mission: get your
              brother laid -- and don't talk to
              any other women.

    Beat.


              That sounds like two missions.


              No, it's just one.


                  
              It kinda sounded like two, right?


                  
              It did.

    Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door.


                  
              GoodbyeIloveyouboth!




    Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances
    over and sees:

    A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS
    again.

    Kate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and
    Freda.


              You okay?


                  
              Yeah. Are you?


                  
              Um...sure.




              Good.
                  
              Hey, I'm not really okay.


              Oh...


              My bitch sister just took off and
              left me here so she could hook up
              with some asshole. Now what am I
              supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a
              car here.


              I guess I could...


              You'll give me a ride? Oh my god!
              Thank you!

    Freda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over.                   *


              I was gonna say "call you a cab,"
              `cause, you know -- I don't even
              know you.


              It's not far. Please? Pretty
              please...?

    Kate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do.






    The car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown.             *

    Kate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances
    down at the floor and notices a FLASK.                            *


              You know, you shouldn't drink and
              drive.


              I wasn't --


              Just kidding. Can I have a sip?



Kate's speechless.


          I'm really thirsty.


          It's, uh...whiskey.


          Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love
          whiskey. You're the real thing,
          huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like
          me!

Freda takes a swig from Kate's flask.


          I don't know. No.


          Can I smoke in your car?


              
          Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you
          just roll down the window?


          Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.

Freda takes out a --

-- CRACK PIPE and lights it, deeply inhaling crack smoke.


              


Kate immediately pulls the car over.


          Not what I thought you meant.


          Want a hit?


          No, I...is that pot?


              (as though it's a
               ridiculous question)
          Of course not! What do I look like?
          A stoner?




              
          It's crack.


          Oh, shit! No...no thank you.


          C'mon -- it's good crack.


          I don't, um...I've never smoked
          crack.


              
          Really? This stuff is the truth --
          and it'll sober you up.


          Uh...I think you should go.


          I'm not getting out in the middle
          of nowhere. Do you know what could
          happen to me all alone out here at                     *
          night?


          I don't know -- people might offer
          you crack?


          Seriously? It's not a big deal --
          just take a little hit.

Kate and Freda stare at each other. A stand-off.


          I said no.


          One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober
          you up.

Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of
her.


              (high-pitched cartoon
               voice)
          Smoke me!

Kate LAUGHS.




              One puff. Then we are both going
              home.

    Freda nods. Long beat.


              Fine.

    Freda puts the pipe into Kate's lips and lights it. Kate
    sucks in crack smoke. Her eyelids flutter.


              You've got money, right?




    Near some TENTS, CARDBOARD BOXES, and SHOPPING CARTS --

    -- Kate smokes crack with FREDA and TWO OLDER MEN. They pass
    around TWO PIPES.



    Freda is passed out on a SLEEPING BAG on the sidewalk.

    Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- who're
    still smoking crack.


                  
              ...'cause I feel like I understand
              what it's like to be homeless, ya
              know? I mean, if you didn't know
              me, if we hadn't connected tonight,
              you might think: "There's some
              upper-middle-class, NPR listening,
              self-congratulatory, insulated,
              lazy liberal bitch. Probably never
              had to worry about anything." But
              that's not true at all! I grew up
              poor, man. Single mother.
              McDonald's used to have one day a
              week where they sold 29 cent
              hamburgers, and another day where
              they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My
              mom and me would go there and she'd
              get twenty burgers -- that was the
              limit, probably set up for folks
              just like us -- and then she'd put
              `em in the freezer and we'd
              microwave `em for dinner throughout
              the week.




               I was kinda overweight until high
               school, to be perfectly honest.
               Eating used to be my thing. When I
               started drinking, though, I kinda
               stopped eating so much.
                   
               But anyway, the point is: You and
               me, we're not so different.

     The two guys aren't paying much attention to Kate. They're
     more concerned with their crack pipe.




     Kate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kate's
     eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused,
     then jumps to her feet.




     Kate runs through the streets.




     We TRACK along with Kate as she dashes past various               *
     buildings.                                                        *




     We stare down a long, empty street, the downtown SKYSCRAPERS      *
     towering in the distance. From out of nowhere --                  *

     -- Kate appears at the end of the street and sprints towards      *
     the camera.                                                       *










     Kate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her
     hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down
     at --

     -- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls.



    She passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland     *
    Park.                                                             *




    Kate slowly pulls into the driveway of a small, cute house.





    Kate walks into the kitchen to find --

    -- Charlie asleep at the kitchen table. CELL PHONE next to
    his head. Empty BEER BOTTLES litter the table.

    Kate tip-toes across the kitchen.

    Charlie quickly jerks up.


                  
              Huh?!


              Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to
              sleep.


              What happened? I came home and you
              were gone and I waited and waited.


              It's a long story.


              I was worried. I kept calling you.


              I ended up...

    Charlie SNIFFS Kate.


              You smell funny. What do you smell
              like?


              I fell asleep in my car. Near the
              bar. I was too drunk to drive.




               So, why didn't you come back or
               call me?


               Charlie --
                    
               -- I'm fine.


               Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby.
               I love you -- and you know how you
               get sometimes.


               I love you too. But I'm home. It's
               over. I gotta get to work.


               I can't be worried about you all
               the time.

     Kate rubs Charlie's hair and kisses his forehead.


               Don't worry so much. I'm fine.
                   
               C'mon -- let me get you to bed.


               I'm up now -- how `bout I make us
               bacon and egg sandwiches?

     Kate smiles.


                   
               Magic words.




     Kate takes a shower -- while she drinks a BEER.                *

     Gets dressed.

     Puts on make-up.




     Kate walks into the kitchen, ready to go. Charlie is at the
     stove, cooking bacon and eggs. He hands Kate a MUG OF COFFEE
     and gestures to the table -- where there's a CHECK.




               Check for your mom's on the table.


               Thanks, baby.

     Kate takes a sip of coffee.


               Why does the coffee taste so much
               better when you make it?


               Because I make it with love -- and
               bacon.

     Kate LAUGHS and kisses Charlie.




     Kate takes a right on a STREET and then pulls into the            *



     She's about to get out, but then notices...

     ...the FLASK on the floor.



     Kate chugs what's left in the flask.



     MR. DAVIES -- the assistant principal, early-40's, slightly       *
     nerdy but not bad looking, watches --                             *

     -- Kate drink in her car.                                         *

     CHILDREN pass by in the distance.                                 *

     Mr. Davies takes a beat, but instead of saying anything he        *
     walks away through the parking lot.                               *

     Kate doesn't notice she's been seen.                              *








     Kate stands next to a CHALKBOARD in front of a class of THIRD
     GRADERS. She's really animated -- doing her "game show
     hostess" schtick.

     On the chalkboard are the letters: "AN"


                   
               Now, if I add a "C," what word do I
               have?

     A STUDENT raises her hand.


               Yes, Hillary?                                         *


               Can?


               That's correct! Can. You've won an
               all-expenses paid trip to the
               blackboard, Hillary!                                  *

     Hillary hesitates. She looks embarrassed.                       *


               C'mon...there's a washer-dryer
               combo in it for you.

     Hillary shuffles up to the board and writes "CAN."              *


               Great job, Hillary -- let's give                      *
               her a round of applause!

     The class APPLAUDS.

     Hillary smiles and goes back to her seat.                       *


               Can anyone use "can" in a sentence?

     A student -- ANGELA -- raises her hand.


               Yes?


               "Hurry up in there -- I gotta use
               the can!"



The students GIGGLE.


              
          Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro
          with flames painted on the hood.

The students CHEER.


          Now --
              
          -- what's another word I could make
          by adding a letter to "an"?

Nobody raises their hand.


          C'mon...

Finally, a student in the back -- RAMON -- raises his hand.


          Yes -- Ramon?





          P...okay, what word would that make
          if I added a "P"?


          Um...pan?


          Pan! That's right. Ramon
          Martinez...COME ON DOWN!

Ramon walks up and begins to write "PAN."


          Wow! Just look at that excellent
          penman --

Kate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth. She
quickly runs behind her desk, leans over, and discretely --

-- VOMITS on the floor!

Ramon -- who's just inches from the pool of vomit -- looks
horrified.

Kate glances up from behind her desk to see --



     -- the kids all make grossed-out faces and say things like --






     Embarrassed, Kate quickly gets TISSUES from her desk and
     begins cleaning up the mess.


                   
               I'm so sorry you had to see that.

     HILLARY stands up.                                                *


               Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant?


               What?


               My mommy threw up when she was
               pregnant with my little sister. Are
               you pregnant?

     Some of the kids begin WHISPERING (saying things like "Ooh!"
     "She's gonna have a baby.").


               Are you?

     Kate seems flustered and says --


               Yes.




     Kate sits across a desk from --

     -- PRINCIPAL BARNES: female, early 50's, stern, scattered,        *
     and clearly a softy at heart, she wears a pair of GLASSES         *
     around her neck.                                                  *


               Vice Principal Davies will be
               looking after your students for the
               rest of the day -- so you don't
               need to worry about that.




          Oh, that's really good to know.
          I'll have to thank him.
              
          I just feel awful for getting sick
          in front of my students.


          Oh, please -- they're troopers. I'm
          sure they've seen plenty worse.
              
          So -- how long have you been
          pregnant?


          Um...it's the first trimester.


          Well, it's very exciting. You must
          be thrilled.


              
          Uh-huh.



          Can I ask a...personal question?


          Okay.


          How's it...
              
          ...going for you?


          Huh?


          The pregnancy, I mean.

Kate's not sure how to respond.


          Having kids wasn't in the cards for
          me. I came close, but...

Principal Barnes drifts off into thought for a moment, then
catches herself and quickly shifts gears.




          ...I mean, it's like I've got a
          couple hundred kids here --
              
          -- but...I don't fool myself. It's
          not the same.


              
          Well...it's hard to explain.


          Of course...


          I wouldn't call it a burden, but --


          It's a responsibility.

Beat.


          Yeah. Exactly.


              
          You're so lucky.
              
          Can I...touch it?


          Um, I don't...okay -- but it sleeps
          a lot.


          Of course.


          Like...a lot.

Principal Barnes gets up and kneels next to Kate. She places
her hand on Kate's belly and closes her eyes.


              
          Hello in there. Can you hear me?
          You're a tiny miracle. Did you know
          that? A miracle.

Principal Barnes looks up at Kate and smiles -- with tears in
her eyes.





     Kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her
     classroom. Through the glass she sees --

     -- Mr. Davies. He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned
     smile you give someone right after they've publicly
     embarrassed themselves).

     Kate mouths the words --


                   
               Thank you.

     -- and gestures "come here."

     Mr. Davies gestures   to the class that he'll be right back --
     before he walks out   to talk to Kate. He's got a slightly
     nervous demeanor --   somewhere between "I never became
     comfortable talking   to women" and Asperger's.


               Is everything, um...okay, Mrs.
               Hannah?


               Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed
               -- but I feel a lot better. And I
               just wanted to say thank you.

     Mr. Davies glances down the hall.


               Look -- I'm not a fool.
                   
               I know you were drinking this
               morning.

     Kate looks shocked.


               I saw you.


                   
               Oh, no, I...


               Drinking when you're pregnant is
               really dangerous.




               I know that! Oh, God, I...
                   
               ...listen -- I'm not actually
               pregnant.


               What?


               I'm just really hung over. The kids
               started asking me questions after I
               vomited and I panicked.


               Oh. That's...not good.


               I know. I...please don't say
               anything.

     Mr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond.


               Just...go home. Get some sleep.

     Before Kate can say a word, Mr. Davies heads back into the
     classroom.




     Kate has her face fully in the sink while water runs over it
     and --

     -- TWO LITTLE GIRLS curiously watch.




     Kate and Charlie play POOL while splitting a PITCHER OF BEER.
     It's a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not?


               I had such a crappy morning.


               Me too. I spent like three hours at
               the post office trying to buy
               stamps and stuff.

     Kate takes a long sip of beer.




          I told my class I was pregnant.

Charlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over
and grabs her hand.


              (excited and sort of
               confused)
          Oh, baby, that's --


          I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry.


                
          Oh.
              
          `Cause it would be great news -- if
          it was true.
              
          `Course then I'd have to drink your
          beer...


          Well, it was a lie. I just lied to
          my class. After barfing in front of
          them.


              
          Ooh...


          Yeah, that's what they said.
              
          Listen...I can't do this anymore.

A look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlie's
face.


          What do you mean?


          I dunno. I think I might...drink
          too much.

Charlie LAUGHS.


          Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do.

Charlie swigs his beer.




I know I do -- I'm a fucking
mess...


Baby -- that's not true. You're
beautiful. And brilliant. And I
love you. I wouldn't be married to
a "mess."


I left work after puking in front           *
of little kids. And...now I'm               *
drinking in the middle of the day.          *


Well, those things happen
sometimes.
    
I mean, they shouldn't happen all
the time, but...it's the price of,
uh, truly living life.


Isn't that like a slogan for some
kind of beer or toothpaste or
something...?


No. And it's true -- you and me,
we're not just some boring couple
in the suburbs who don't sleep with
each other and have nothing to talk
about except whatever TV show
they're currently into.
    
We, like...still know how to party.


Yeah...
    
...I think I need to slow down.
    
And I might need help.


I'll help you.


I know, but...I might need more
help.


Yeah? Like a therapist?




          I don't know -- I just get stupid
          when I'm drunk, and I'm drunk a
          lot.


          We just like to have a good time.


          Yeah, well...
              
          ...you've gotta promise not to tell
          this to anyone.


              
          I promise.


          That includes Owen.


          Of course.


          Well, last night I kinda, um...
              
          ...smoked some crack.




Some bar patrons glance at Kate and Charlie.


          After I left the bar, I, uh, picked
          up this drunk girl and...I don't
          really remember what came next, but
          I ended up smoking crack with her.


              
          Uh...how's that even happen?
              
          You give someone a ride and she
          rewards you with crack?!


          Well...she seemed desperate. She
          really needed a ride home.


          Where?




          Downtown. I think she maybe lives
          in...a tent?


          What?


          Well...she might be homeless. Or a
          prostitute. Or just some lost
          sorority girl.
              
          To be honest, I'm not sure...


              
          Oh, my god...you smoked crack with
          some random stranger? Did
          you...share a pipe?

Kate doesn't answer. She doesn't need to.


          Ughhh...
              
          Just playing Devil's advocate, but
          maybe it's the crack-smoking you
          need help with and not the
          drinking.

Kate gives Charlie a dirty look.


          I'm just saying.


          The drinking led to the crack-
          smoking. The drinking leads to
          everything stupid I do.
              
          I mean...can you even remember the
          last time we had sober sex?

Charlie begins to answer, but then...goes blank. He tries to
remember. And can't.


          We'll chill out with the booze for
          a while. We can just be wine-with-                   *
          dinner people.
              
          How's that sound?





     Kate and Charlie joyfully ride BICYCLES home from the bar.


               Maybe you should go to, uh... one
               of those meetings. They have `em
               over there.

     Charlie gestures to a

     BUILDING (could be a church or different type of building
     where AA meets).

     Kate LAUGHS.


               Yeah, right.


               Remember when I was shit-faced and
               took that Q &amp; A pamphlet from
               there?


                   
               Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to
               like every question and at the end
               it was like, "If you answered `yes'
               to any of these you're an
               alcoholic!"


               Yeah...
                   
               ...that was fun, wasn't it?

     Kate smiles and nods.


               Hey --

     Charlie gestures to the street.


               -- look out for that crack!

     Kate looks down but sees nothing.


               What crack?




               Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a
               crack there...
                   
               ...but you must have smoked it last
               night.

     Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards
     Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away.
     Kate chases after him.




     While an old 70's R &amp; B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which
     is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS --

     -- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and        *
     LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET.


               "Have you missed days of work or
               school because of drinking?"


               Absolutely.


               "Do you envy people who can drink
               without getting into trouble?"


               Envy isn't exactly the right
               word...


               "Do you have `blackouts'?"


               Yeah, but who doesn't?


               "Has your drinking caused trouble
               at home?"


               No! We're great.


               Yeah. Definitely. But we still had
               a lot of "yes" answers.
                   
               Yep...we still qualify as drunks.




               I'm gonna go!


                   
               Yeah, right.


               No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go.
               What time is it?


               Eight.

     Kate gets up.


               See ya.


                   
               Uh-huh...

     Kate takes a big sip of wine.


                   
               This is me: going.

     Charlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it.


               You've been boozing.


               So? You should come too!

     Charlie LAUGHS.


               Yeah, right. You can't go to AA
               wasted. It's like a rule or
               something.


               Oh, yeah? Watch me!




     An AA meeting is in progress.

     An OLDER WOMAN stands at the podium sharing her story.



The room is filled with --

-- different groups of PEOPLE, all of whom sit with their
"own group," like a high school lunch room -- but the people
are adults. There are distinct groups of --







-- and "HIPSTERS."

As Kate -- who's slightly confused -- enters the building, a
hip looking man -- DONOVAN, 30's -- stops her, extending his
hand.


              
          Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.


          Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!

Donovan "shushes" Kate.


          You must be a newcomer, huh?


          A what?


              
          Um, I'm not really allowed to talk
          to new chicks, but there are lots
          of women here who can help you out.


              
          Okay.
              
          Do I just sit wherever?


          The meeting already started so just
          try to find a spot anywhere.

Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying
things like "sorry" and "I like that jacket" as she takes a
seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN.



As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next
to Kate quietly try to welcome her.


          Are you new?


          To this? Yeah. Why's everyone
          whispering?


          It's hard, huh?


          I guess.


          Everything's going to be fine.
          You're home.

Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear
anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally
joined Jim Jones' church.



The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE.

The tattooed man stands at the podium.


          Not to embarrass anyone, but so
          that we may get to know you better -
          - is there anybody here in their
          first thirty days of recovery?

Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and
introduce themselves as alcoholics.

Kate stands up.


          I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a
          little drunk right now.

People burst into LAUGHTER.


          Do you want me to talk about my
          childhood or something?




              
          You know, Kate, we actually ask
          that you don't share if you've had                  *
          a drink or any mind-altering
          substance in the past 24 hours.


              
          I can -- I kinda hate my dad and
          don't talk to him. And my mom...oh,
          man...I don't even know where to
          start. She's, like, stuck in the
          80's and kind of a metalhead. Her
          last boyfriend called himself a
          drummer but really just gave drum
          lessons to little kids and --


              
          Welcome, Kate.
              
          It gets better.


              
          I like drinking is the thing. I
          mean, I don't want to say you guys
          are wrong or anything...

Kate nervously LAUGHS.

Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate.


          Thank you -- we're all here to
          help. We do have to move on,
          though.

The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down.


          Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be
          plenty of time to tell your story.

A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium.


          Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't
          really believe that it's been five
          years. I mean, my life was a mess
          back then. Now I'm back in school,
          I have an amazing man, I love my
          parents -- it's crazy...




              
          How old is that girl?! Can she even
          go to bars?
              
          How old are you, Amber?


          Be respectful.

Kate seems surprised at being chastised.


              
          Um...okay? It's because I did the
          work. I got down on my knees and
          prayed every night! I went to a
          meeting everyday!


          Everyday?


          It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say,
          I owe everything to AA. Well, AA --
          and God, of course!

The whole room APPLAUDS.



Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY



          God grant me the serenity to accept
          the things I cannot change --
          courage to change the things I can -
          - and wisdom to know the
          difference.




Everyone turns and looks at Kate.


              
          Okay...I think I'm good.

Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived.





     Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER.


               So much for that.

     Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss-
     crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN


     They drunkenly play CROQUET.                                      *


               Was it a bunch of old biker guys?


               No, it was...I don't know.
               Enthusiastic people. A lot of
               really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!


               Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm
               sorry it wasn't cool.

     Charlie thinks for a moment.


               I can't really imagine never
               drinking. I guess I don't have to,
               though --
                   
               -- you're the one with the problem.

     Kate nods in agreement.                                           *


               Hey -- I love you. I don't want you
               to have to drink.


               I don't have to drink.
                   
               I just really like to drink.                            *


                   
               Good -- `cause you're my favorite
               person to drink with in the whole
               damn world.

     Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment,
     and then Kate...



     ...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate
     grins mischievously.


               Oh, no you didn't!

     Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie
     dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in
     the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too
     intense.




     Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed. Kate starts to
     unbutton Charlie's shirt. As it turns out, Charlie's
     extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and
     voice).


               Are you trying to have some sex?

     Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing. She
     climbs on top of him and --

     -- they start having sloppy, drunk sex.

     After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving.
     She looks down to discover that --

     -- he's passed out.

     Kate pauses for a moment...then continues to ride her
     unconscious husband.




     Kate drinks what's left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she
     drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more
     booze. She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a
     couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there
     isn't more alcohol in the house.



     Kate puts on her slippers, robe and --




     Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her
     robe and slippers).





     Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is
     kept. After several attempts, she gives up and grabs TWO
     BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf.

     Kate sets the bottles on the counter.                             *

     The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30's -- looks at Kate
     with pity.


               You know I can't sell you this,
               Kate.

     An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at
     Kate.                                                             *


               What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come
               on -- I'm in here all the time. You
               know me.


               Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're
               old enough -- but it's too late.

     The clerk holds up his WATCH .


               C'mon -- we can just pretend it's
               before two...

     Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk's watch.


                   
               Stop it.


               It's just a little wine. I'm not
               driving or anything.


               I don't think so. Sorry.

     Kate gives him a big, flirty smile.


               Come on, dude -- I'll let you have
               a sip if you want.

     Kate tries to do a "sexy" dance.




          It's the law. I can't sell alcohol
          after 2 a.m. You know that.


          Why don't you give it to me, then?
          That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift
          -- because we're friends.


          I could lose my job.

Kate doesn't have anything to say back -- so she glances at
the Elderly Man in the frozen food section.                   *


              (to the elderly man; meant
               to be a whisper, but way
               too loud)
          You distract him, okay?!

The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of
it.


          Look -- why don't you get a bottle
          of water or a coffee or something
          instead?


          Water or coffee? Fuck you. What --
          just cause I won't suck your dick?


              
          Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you
          gotta go.

Kate doesn't budge.


          Seriously, Kate. You should go.


          Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with
tears.


          This is bullshit!
              
          I have to pee.



     Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door -
     - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down
     and begins to pull up her robe.


               What the fuck are you doing?!


                   
               I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just
               have to pee really, really bad.                         *


                   
               Get outta here NOW!


                   
               C'mon...can't we drink together?

     The clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned,
     and then...

     ...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door.




     Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles
     River. The empty bottle of  wine is next to her.

     Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby.

     A bird SQUAWKS.

     Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state
     she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike.




     Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the
     sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and
     realizes that --

     -- it's 7:30.

     She jumps out of bed in a panic.


               Charlie!

     Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down
     at the bed, which is --






              
          Not again.

Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of
the bed.


          Come back to bed, baby.


          I have to go to work. You snoozed
          my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.


          Well, you peed on me so I guess                     *
          we're even.                                         *


          I have a weak bladder.


          Well...I can't go to work like
          this.


          You work from our kitchen.


          Yeah, but changing the sheets is my
          real job.
              
          Hey -- where were you last night?


          Huh?


          I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you
          were gone.


          Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone?
          You must've been dreaming.

Kate then glances down and notices --

-- that HER FEET ARE COVERED IN DIRT AND GRASS.

She pauses, slightly alarmed, but continues getting ready.





     Kate's on her knees, puking into a toilet.



     Kate exits the stall to find --

     -- Principal Barnes standing by the door.





               I can only imagine the chemistry
               experiment that's going on --

     Barnes points at Kate's stomach.


                   
               -- in there.




     Kate sits on a SMALL CHAIR reading a CHILDREN'S BOOK to her
     class --

     -- who're sitting Indian style in a semi-circle.


               Are you gonna have a boy or a girl?


               I don't know yet.


               When will you know?


               Not until summertime. You guys will
               be on vacation.


               If you have a boy what will you
               name him?


               Maybe...Woodrow Wilson?


               That's a name for a man -- not a
               baby!



     The children LAUGH.

     Kate LAUGHS too -- but looks a little freaked out.




     Kate eats her PACKED LUNCH with Mr. Davies.


               Thanks again for covering for me.


               I can't promise to cover for you
               every time you get pregnant.


               There won't be another time.


               I genuinely hope not. Look -- I
               didn't tell Barnes, but if anything
               like this happens again I'll have
               to.

     Mr. Davies smiles -- a sweet, genuine smile.


               Okay...Kate?


                   
               Okay...
                   
               ...David?

     Beat.


               Dave.

     Kate tries to hold back a smile.


               I know -- Dave Davies...yup...hah-
               hah. Anyway, uh, is everything okay
               with you?


               I don't know.
                   
               Um...no?




          I puked in front of my class and
          then told everyone I'm pregnant.
          That's not really okay, huh?


          No, I don't think so.


          I went to AA last night.


              
          Oh, yeah? What'd you think of it?


          It was awful. I kept getting
          shushed.


          I don't normally tell people I work
          with this... but --

Mr. Davies takes a COIN that says "Nine Years" out of his
pocket and shows it to Kate.


          -- I'm a bit of an expert when it
          comes to these things.


                 
          You?


          Yeah, me. I've lived a strange one.                    *
          I'm nine years sober, AA and NA.
              
          I used to drink cocaine.
              (off Kate's shocked
               expression)
          It's really cheap in the
          Philippines.

Mr. Davies takes a beat to think about what he's saying.


          Listen, Kate. I know meetings can
          be weird. Especially at first, but
          if you want to...you never need to
          feel like you have to...but the
          ones I go to are pretty small. Nice
          little groups.
              
          I'd be happy to take you.




          Maybe that would be good...I don't
          know.


          No pressure, okay. That shit saved
          my life, though.

Principal Barnes walks in.


              
          Well, I'm scheduled to observe Ms.
          Carol's art class. They're making
          macaroni art, so...I'm pretty
          stoked.

Mr. Davies gets up to leave -- discretely winking at Kate as
he exits.

Principal Barnes watches Mr. Davies leave, a puzzled
expression on her face.


              
          Mrs. Hannah -- I've got something
          for you...

Principal Barnes opens the MINI FRIDGE to reveal a huge jug
of ORANGE JUICE.


          Folic Acid! You need it now like
          never before.


              
          Thanks.


          I bet your mother is over the moon,
          huh? Probably planning you a baby
          shower...?


          Oh, well...she and I aren't that
          close.


          Oh, I'm sorry. Well, listen -- any
          motherly thing you need -- I'm                       *
          here, okay?

Barnes hands Kate a large glass of juice.




               Now drink up -- that baby in
               there's thirsty!


               Okay.
                   (takes a sip of orange
                     juice)
               And...you're kinda the only person
               at school -- besides Mr. Davies --
               who knows I'm pregnant. Could
               you...?


               My lips are --

     Principal Barnes mimes "zipping" her lips.





     Kate walks in the front door to see    --                      *

     -- Charlie working on his computer. A BEER next to him. An
     old record PLAYS on the record player.


               Hey...


               Howdy.

     Kate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him.


               How was your day? And what's that
               smell?


               Eh -- alright. Couldn't find
               oatmeal so I made ketchup soup.


                   
               Charlie! You need to eat.


               What? It's tasty.
                   
               So...I'm going to see that band                      *
               from Iceland with the triplets play                  *
               tonight. Want to come with me and
               Owen to check it out?




          Oh, that sounds fun, but...


          C'mon -- Owen can't pick up girls
          without you.


          I don't know...this guy I work with
          -- Mr. Davies --


          The Vice Principal?


          Yeah -- turns out he's sober and
          invited me to a meeting.


              
          Wow, that's...uh, cool.

Charlie goes silent.


          What?


          Nothing -- I just...I didn't think
          you really loved the meeting you
          went to yesterday. In fact, it
          sounded like you hated it. So I'm
          kinda surprised you're going back.


          Well...this is a smaller meeting.
          It might be different. I dunno -- I
          think I want to give it a fair
          shot.

Charlie nods.


          Besides -- I was hammered last
          night.
              
          Go on and have fun out drinking
          with Owen tonight. Seriously. I'm
          just gonna, you know, try something         *
          different...

Charlie pulls Kate close to him.




               I'm here for you, okay? Even though
               I drink -- I could slow down if you
               need me to.
                   
               I'm sure I could.




     Kate approaches a small church.

     Mr. Davies waits outside.





     Mr. Davies walks Kate into a medium sized room where --

     -- about TEN PEOPLE are getting coffee, talking, and setting


     Kate looks around the room, scoping out the people, who're
     very different from the crowd at the previous night's meeting


     -- several BLUE COLLAR MEN --

     -- JENNY: 40-ish, with dark hair and a confident, sort of        *
     tough demeanor --

     -- a few OLDER PEOPLE, and a YOUNG COUPLE.

     Mr. Davies directs Kate over to a table with COFFEE and



               This is a little more my speed. No
               one here is the slightest bit hip.


               Does everybody just...kinda, you
               know -- talk here?


               Pretty much. Someone leads -- tells
               their story. And then everyone else
               shares -- talks.


               So since you're taking me here does
               that make you my sponsor?




            No -- I don't think I could do                     *
            that.
                
            `Cause, um...
                
            ...well, it could get weird. But                   *
            I'll help you find one if you want.
                
            We should sit down.

Kate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats.


                (takes a deep breath; to
                 Mr. Davies)
            I can't believe I'm really here.


            It gets better. Weirder, maybe --
            but better.



The meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of
chairs.

Jenny is midway through her speech.                            *


            ...all I knew about taking care of
            myself was fucking people over and
            lying to get by. I had no idea how
            to even look for a normal job or
            pay my bills on time -- or pay my
            fucking bills at all.
                
            Now I pay my bills online.

The group CHUCKLES.


            And I found a love in cooking. I've                *
            got my own catering business now.                  *
            And...maybe I just replaced alcohol
            with chocolate chips and
            cigarettes, but still...it's been
            years since I woke up in a park --
            in a different state.



Kate leans in towards Mr. Davies and whispers --




             I kinda like her.


             Sponsor potential?

Kate nods.


             Get her number at break.


             I feel like you're my wingman.

Kate grins at Mr. Davies, who smiles shyly and glances away.



An older man -- ARLO -- stands and announces.


             Arlo, Alcoholic. There'll now be a
             ten minute break. Smoke em' if you
             got em.

As some of the PEOPLE go outside --

-- Kate walks over to Jenny, who's getting a cup of coffee.    *


             Hey, I liked your speech.


             Thanks. All that dumb shit happened
             so I'm glad that now it's at least
             entertaining.
                 
             What's your name?


             Kate. This is my first meeting.
             Or... first meeting where I'm not
             wasted.

Jenny LAUGHS.                                                  *


             Oh, yeah -- I remember doing some
             of that.


             I don't really know how this stuff
             works.




          But...could I get your number? I
          mean, I may not need it, but...


          Yeah, of course. I can help explain
          it to you -- and also, we can just
          talk.


          Okay. Yeah.
              
          You've been sober since you were


Jenny nods.                                                   *


          That seems really young.


          I didn't have much of a choice -- I
          crashed my car into a nursing home.
              
          I think the break is just about
          over. This meeting is the kind
          where everyone can share. Sharing
          always helps me, so...if it's not
          too weird -- try introducing
          yourself and telling the group
          what's going on.



Everyone is sitting down and sharing. The woman  next   *
to Kate is finishing up.


          ...anyway, that's where I'm at
          today. Thanks for listening.

Everyone looks at Kate.


          Okay, um...hello. I'm Kate and...
              
          ...I'm an alcoholic?

Kate nervously LAUGHS.


          Hi, Kate.




               Sorry. I don't mean to laugh --
               it's just saying those words...
                   
               ...I think I'm an alcoholic, but I
               don't really know. I drink -- a
               lot. I've always drank. Everyone I
               know drinks a lot. I never really
               thought I had a problem -- lately
               though it seems like maybe I do. I
               just want to be able to drink a
               beer without it turning into twenty
               -- or wetting my bed.
                   
               It seems like every time I drink
               something awful happens. All the
               shit that I used to laugh off isn't
               really funny anymore. The dumb
               drunk stuff has gone from
               embarrassing to scary.
                   
               I'm kinda...scared.

     Kate stops. Looks around self-consciously.




     A SERIES OF short, quick scenes:




     Kate sits at her desk grading papers. Kate's hand has an
     uncontrollable tremble as she tries to carefully make red
     checks on students' papers. Self-consciously, she steadies         *
     her right hand with her left.








     Kate shovels chocolate chips from the bag into her mouth
     while driving.









     Kate is at a meeting -- talking to Jenny.                           *








     While Kate and Charlie eat dinner, Kate drinks WATER but
     focuses on Charlie's glass of WINE and the slow, careful sips
     he takes.








     Charlie and Owen play video games and LAUGH while Kate tries
     to concentrate on a book -- but is clearly distracted by how
     loud the guys are.








     Charlie sleeps on the other side of the bed as Kate writes in
     a notebook. Kate stops writing. She stares at Charlie as he
     sleeps.








     Kate rides her bicycle hard. It might even be...exercise?




               How about ninety days?







     EVERYONE is dressed differently, some people have different
     hair-cuts, etc.

     Mr. Davies stands up, holding a PLASTIC CASE.


               Is there anyone here who has ninety
               days of continuous sobriety?

     Kate stands up -- she looks way more "together" than she did
     earlier. She gives Mr. Davies a hug -- and he hands her a "90



               I'm Kate. I'm an alcoholic.

     Everyone CLAPS.


               Hi, Kate.

     Kate sits down next to Jenny and gives her a hug.                 *


                   
               Congratulations.




     Kate -- who eats a piece of CAKE -- sits on a patio with          *
     Jenny, Mr. Davies, and several other PEOPLE from AA.              *


               I'm really proud of you, Kate.


               I kinda can't believe it's been
               ninety days.
                   
               The longest I've gone since high
               school without drinking was, like,
               a week.


               My first three months were such
               hell. I think I'm only sober today
               because I just never want to go
               through that again.




          It's weird -- in after-school
          specials the getting-sober part was
          only like a minute of the movie and
          suddenly...daddy's all okay.

Several people LAUGH.


          But it's so fucking hard and weird
          and suddenly I have all these other
          problems now that drinking isn't
          the problem.


          Like what?                                  *


          Everything else. Work, my non-
          existent relationship with my
          mom...


          When was the last time you saw her?


              
          A year, at least.


          Well...maybe it's time.


          Maybe.
              
          And then there's my marriage. I
          mean, Charlie's great. Really
          great, he's supportive, especially
          at first. It's strange, though. I
          feel like alcohol was the thing
          that connected us and now that I
          don't drink we lead these two very
          different lives.
              
          We haven't slept together in
          forever...
              
          I haven't pissed myself in awhile,
          though. So that's good.


          It takes time.

Kate gives an exasperated look.




                   (half-stern cheerleader
                    tone)
               Keep working the steps.
                   
               Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I
               should actually run you home now
               and come back. I need to start
               locking up.


               I could stick around and help
               you...


                   
               I could take you home.
                   
               If you want.




     Mr. Davies pulls up to Kate's house.


               My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink --
               well, not like us, but as soon as I
               got sober I started to change and
               she just...didn't.


               I didn't know you were married.

     Beat.


               Yeah, I was married once --
                   
               -- in my other life. But I
               shouldn't be talking to you about
               this stuff.


               Why?


               I don't know...


               Because you're a dude we can't
               talk? I don't get that "men stick
               with men, women stick with women"
               stuff.




          Well, if you were sitting where I'm
          sitting you'd understand.


          Are you trying to tell me that you
          have a crush on me?


          What am I, one of your students?            *
          Crush?


          Yeah, crush.


              
          I kind of do, yes. I have a crush
          on you. I know that's wrong --
          you're newly sober and married and
          I shouldn't be thinking about you
          like that. But yeah, I should put
          that out on the table.
              
          Honesty.


          It's okay. I think you're a really
          good guy.


          Oh, great -- good guys are the
          nerds that carry the pretty girls'
          books.


          Oh, c'mon...


          I think you're beautiful.

Kate smiles bashfully.


          And smart, and sexy, and cool...

Mr. Davies moves slightly closer to Kate.


          And I know it's wrong, but -- in
          meetings I stare at your lips and
          your legs and all I can think about
          is fucking your moist pussy.



     Kate jumps back, aghast.


                   (off Kate's horrified
                    expression)
               Oh, crap! I don't know why I just
               said that. I'm really, really
               sorry.





                   
               Oh, that was a bad thing to say,
               right?





               I'm so, so sorry. I'm just
               confused, and I don't know how to
               talk to women --


               Jesus -- you can't just go around
               telling people you want to fuck
               their "moist pussy."
                   
               Who even says that?


               I'm really sorry.

     Kate gets out of the car, slams the door shut, then leans in
     to say --


               I have to go inside my house --
               where I live with my husband.
                   
               Thanks for your creepy version of
               honesty.




     Kate lies in bed and appears slightly bored as --

     -- Charlie is under the covers, going down on Kate.


               You okay?




              
          Yep -- I'm just pacing myself. The
          tortoise wins the race.


          Actually, I'm not really in the
          mood.


          But I wanted to give you a 90 days
          gift.


          It's okay -- the 90 days was the
          gift.


          Sorry if I was doing a bad job --
          I'm kinda hammered.


          It's alright. Charlie...
              
          ...I miss you.


          Huh?                                                *

Charlie comes up from under the covers -- and looks a bit     *
tipsy.                                                        *


          I mean...I don't know. I don't
          really feel connected to you
          anymore.


          Did I do something?


          No.
              
          We don't talk that much.


          We used to talk, but now you come
          home and go to meetings and by the
          time you get back I'm --


          Kinda drunk.




             I was gonna say "tired."

Silence.


             There's some stuff I need to do
             this weekend. I think I'm gonna go
             up to Lake Arrowhead.


             Really? To see your mom?

Kate nods.


             Why?


                 
             Do I need a reason?


             With your mom? Kinda.
                 
             Is this the "amends" step?


             No.


             Well then why're you going?


                 
             We send her checks. But we never
             actually see her. Sometimes it
             feels like I'm paying her to not be
             in my life. I thought it would be
             nice to visit her.
                 
             And Jenny thinks it would be a good         *
             idea.

Charlie LAUGHS.


             What?


             I don't know...I mean, do you do
             everything your sponsor tells you
             to do?




               No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or
               something?


               I dunno...it's been a long damn
               time since you've seen your mom.
                   
               And you didn't listen when I
               suggested we visit her.


                   (suddenly gets that it's
                    an ego thing for Charlie)
               Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This
               just...it felt like the right time.
                   
               With all the changes I'm going
               through.


               Well, can I come with you? It'll be
               like a little vacation.


               Um...I think I should go alone.


               Come on, if you do that you'll just
               get depressed. If I go we can try
               to make it fun. Go hiking and
               stuff.


               Well, if you go, don't take this
               the wrong way but -- I'd like it if
               maybe you didn't drink.
                   
               Just while we're there.


                   
               I think I can handle not drinking
               for like a day.

     Kate smiles and snuggles up into Charlie's arms.




     Kate and Charlie drive and listen to MUSIC.












      Kate and Charlie are parked in front of a --

      -- HOUSE. Small. A little run-down. Sort of a vague ski cabin
      look. There's some dirty lawn furniture in the front yard as
      well as a DOZEN LAWN-GNOMES.


                Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed
                those guys.

      Kate playfully punches Charlie in the shoulder.


                    
                Hi, Holger!

      Kate LAUGHS. Long beat.


                So...we gonna go in?

      Charlie glances at Kate and reads the anxiety on her face.




      Kate and Charlie walk to the front door.


                    
                I should've brought something.


                You're fine.


                Something, you know? Flowers, or...


                Wine?


                No. Definitely not that.

      They get to the door. Charlie looks at Kate -- who seems like
      she'd be okay if they ran back to the car.




              
          Go on...

Charlie KNOCKS.


          S'minute!


              
          Oh, God...

The door opens, revealing --

-- ROCHELLE: late-50's, wears an old shredded heavy metal
band T-shirt and tight ripped-up jeans, looks like she enjoys
an afternoon drink or three.


              
          Katie!

Rochelle wraps her arms around Kate.


          What're you doing here?


          I left you a message, mom.


          Oh, you know I don't check that
          thing.
              (notices Charlie; slightly
               flirty)
          Hello there, young man.


          Hi, Ms. Foster.


          Well, then...
              
          ...what a lovely surprise -- you
          two came to visit. Hell has frozen
          over.
              
          Just kidding. Come inside -- let me
          fix you both some drinks.


          Just water for me.



     Rochelle LAUGHS as she leads the way. Kate glances at Charlie
     -- she already seems slightly annoyed.




     Kate and Charlie sit down.

     The place is a MESS. Magazines and junkmail everywhere. Too
     much furniture thrown together in a chaotic manner. The walls
     are covered with framed HEAVY METAL BAND POSTERS -- and there
     are ASHTRAYS everywhere, filled to the brim with cigarette
     butts.


               ...you wouldn't believe how much
               the neighborhood's changed! After
               Mr. Baker passed away and the kids
               put Mrs. Baker in a home, the
               people that moved in, oof!

     Rochelle walks in holding a tray with THREE GIN AND TONICS.


               It's like they don't even
               understand the concept of birth
               control in their country!

     Rochelle hands Charlie a glass and then goes to Kate and puts
     a drink on the table in front of her.


                   
               If you ask me, I think it's a meth
               house.
                   
               They've always got those little
               five year old twins "playing" in
               the yard, but I'm pretty sure
               they're the lookouts.


               That's pretty wild, mom.


               Right?
                   (notices that Kate hasn't
                    touched her drink)
               What's wrong, honey? Think I forgot
               how to mix `em?


               I told you I just wanted water.




          Oh, please! Where I'm from, "no"
          means "yes."
              
          Am I right or am I right?


              
          Huh-huh...


          That's actually why I wanted to
          come up, mom.
              
          I stopped drinking.

Rochelle LAUGHS -- then realizes Kate and Charlie aren't
joking.


              
          Are you telling me I'm going to be
          a grandma?

Rochelle tears up with joy.


          Oh -- that's so exciting! I'm gonna
          be a grandma!
              
          And you know that "no drinking when
          you're pregnant" thing is just a
          myth. I drank plenty when I was
          pregnant with Kate -- and look how
          she turned out!

Beat.


          I'm not pregnant, mom.


          Oh.


          I just needed a break. I'm sober
          for the first time in years.


          Well...
              
          ...we'll see how long that lasts.




          It's been a while, actually.


              
          90 days.


              
          You've sure picked the right
          partner --
              
          -- for this little mission.


              
          Hey -- I'm not drinking
          either...today.


              (to Charlie; slightly
               annoyed)
          Drink if you want to, Charlie.
              
          Charlie didn't stop drinking. I'm
          doing it by myself.
              
          And...I started going to 12-step
          meetings.

Rochelle looks slightly disgusted.


          Ah...yes. Assholes Anonymous.
              
          Katie's father went to those
          meetings a few years after we got
          married. Dried up. Left me. You can
          see how well that worked out for
          me...
              (Rochelle gestures to her
                living room)
          ...I raised his daughter in this
          PALACE while he's somewhere in
          Florida with his shiny new wife and
          kids.
              
          Bastard.
              
          You better be careful -- they
          change.

Kate and Charlie exchange a glance.




               I thought you'd be happy for me,
               mom.


               Oh...I'm sorry -- I'm not being a
               good hostess, am I?

     Rochelle gets up, takes the drink away from Kate, and chugs
     it.


               I'll microwave you your favorite.



     Charlie, Kate, and Rochelle watch a REALITY TV SHOW -- while
     eating...



     Rochelle rests her head on Kate's shoulder.


               I'm sorry if I acted like a bitch.


               It's okay, mom. I know you can't
               help it.




     Kate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village --

     -- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant
     ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the
     middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time.
     Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film.

     Kate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around.


               This place shut down a decade ago
               and then there was a fire and now
               it's basically abandoned.

     Charlie seems totally impressed by the weirdness of the
     place.


               We came here every year the week
               before Christmas.




          And then I worked here in high
          school -- selling hot chocolate.
          And they had real reindeer, too.
          They kept `em over there.

Kate points at the remains of a PEN.


          My mom worked here when she was
          younger. I think everyone who grew                  *
          up around here worked at Santa's
          Village at some point.

Charlie just nods and listens -- he's in awe of this place.


          This is what I think of when I
          think of Christmas.
              
          Thanks for coming up here with me.


          Of course.


          I'm sorry my mom's so awful.


              
          She just can't handle her liquor.

Kate and Charlie look in each other's eyes. Seem to have a
moment. And then Charlie asks --


          Did you ever hook up with guys when
          you worked here?


          Huh?


          You know -- sneak off with a co-
          worker and do it against a pine
          tree or something?


          Um...no.




               I mean, if I were a teenage boy
               working with a stone cold fox like
               you I'd totally want to hook up
               with you here. Like...in the ginger
               bread house.

     Charlie puts his arms around Kate.


               You were probably the coolest girl
               in town -- and the prettiest. I'm
               sure everyone was in love with you.

     Kate giggles. They kiss. It's sweet.







     Kate walks in to her class to find --




     -- a GROUP OF TEACHERS -- including Principal Barnes and Mr.
     Davies -- standing in the room, which has been decked out for
     a --




               I couldn't keep quiet. Sorry. I
               just had to tell everyone so we
               could celebrate.


                   
               Oh...you shouldn't have.


               You don't have to thank me -- just
               open your presents!

     Kate looks at her desk which is stacked with PRESENTS wrapped
     in pink and baby blue wrapping paper. There's also a CAKE.


               Wow...


               Go ahead.




               `C'mon, Kate! You're gonna love
               what I got you! Is it a boy or a
               girl?



     Kate opens a present -- a MOBILE.


                   
               Oh, it's so...nice.


                   
               It's to hang over the crib!


               Uh-huh...

     MONTAGE: Kate opens presents while the teachers CLAP.

     Eventually, Kate begins to CRY -- which everyone assumes are
     tears of joy.

     Principal Barnes takes a bite of cake.


               Mmmm...it's so moist.

     Kate glances at Mr. Davies, who cringes.




     Kate walks to her car.


               Kate!

     Kate looks back to see Mr. Davies running over -- but she
     doesn't reply or slow down.


               Kate?


                   
               What?


               Listen -- I am so, so sorry. You
               have no idea how much this has been
               eating me up.



Long beat.


             What you said to me was really
             fucked up.


             I know.


             What were you even thinking?


             I wasn't -- I was just...I try to
             be really honest.


             I get that. But you can't force
             your "honesty" on everyone you
             know.

Mr. Davies nods. He looks really embarrassed.


                 
             I'm flattered that you
             have...feelings for me. I am. But
             I'm married.


             I know. I'm sorry. I'll apologize
             to your husband if you want.


             No -- you don't have to do that. I
             didn't even tell him. But...you
             can't say that to a girl -- like,
             ever.


             Okay.


             Seriously. Consider that a rule of
             thumb.
                 
             Someday, you're gonna meet a nice,
             available lady -- but if you say
             "moist pussy" to her, you will
             never, ever, ever get to see that
             part of her body!




                    
                Okay.
                    
                Thank you.
                    
                I feel like this was a really good
                talk.

     Kate forces a smile.




     Kate stares at a --

     -- HALF-EATEN BIRTHDAY CAKE 
     on the kitchen table. It's totally mutilated.

     She walks out the back door into the                            *

     Charlie, Owen, and one of Owen's friends --                     *

     Kate walks out.                                                 *

     What's up, Kate?                Hey, Kate.


                I see you guys found the birthday                    *
                cake Jenny and I baked.                              *


                Yeah, thanks! You should get a                       *

          Baby -- I didn't even think about            *
          that. I'm sorry.                             *


          It was really good.                          *


          We have plenty of tequila to make            *
          up for the cake.                             *


          Kate's in AA -- so she can't drink.          *
          She hasn't drank in forever -- like          *
          thirty-eight days or some shit.              *


          Ninety-five days, actually.                  *


          That sucks! Do you still smoke               *

          No, I wasn't a big weed smoker               *

          you?                                         *

Kate's face goes blank. She stares at Charlie.         *


          Shit -- I hear crack gets you so             *
          high!                                        *

          What? I'm joking around. I know              *
          Kate's not a crackhead or some               *
          shit.                                        *

     Charlie walks in to see Kate getting ready to go to bed.          *


               Listen -- I'm sorry. He's
               drunk...really drunk.


               I'm not mad at him -- I'm mad at
               you! You said you wouldn't tell
               anyone about what I did.


               I'm...sorry. I...was drunk too when
               I told him.


               Great.
                   
               Why don't you guys just go to the
               bar now?


               You wanna come?


               I'm hanging here.


               I'm sure they have near-beer, baby.
               It'll be fun.


               I'm staying in.




               That sounds like a lot of fun.


               Bye.

     Beat.


               I love you.

     Kate doesn't say a word.


               I love you...?


               Yeah...
                   
               ...I love you too.




     Kate stands at the BLACKBOARD -- teaching addition and
     subtraction to the class.

     A little girl -- ISABEL -- raises her hand.                       *


               Yes?


               Mrs. Hannah -- shouldn't you be
               more fatter?


               What?


               `Cause of the baby. My mom got real
               fat.


                   
               Well..."Shouldn't you be fatter?"
               is the correct way to ask that
               question.

     Kate goes back to the board -- clearly wanting to move on.




          Now, one day when you're very old
          and wise fourth graders, you'll
          learn about multiplication and --


          Mrs. Hannah -- Shouldn't you be
          more fat?

All the students look at Kate. She's on the spot. Flustered.


          Well, I...

Kate searches for something to say. Anything. But then she
blurts --


          ...I'm not going to have a baby.




Kate immediately looks like she wishes she could take it
back.


          See -- I was pregnant but, it
          wasn't my time, I suppose...

Another little girl -- WINNIE -- jumps in.                       *


          Mrs. Hannah -- did you kill the
          baby?


          WHAT? No -- of course not!


          `Cause my mom says that when you
          kill a baby you go to hell and you
          can't even go to church to ask god
          for forgiveness.

The students begin to WHISPER to each other.

Another boy -- TOBY -- asks --


          Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to
          hell?




                  No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay,
                  listen kids -- we shouldn't be
                  talking about this. But...
                      
                  ...sometimes women get pregnant and
                  then early on -- before it's even a
                  baby -- they stop being pregnant.


                  Because a doctor murders it!


                  No -- not because a doctor   murdered
                  it.
                      
                  It's called a miscarriage.   That
                  means it wasn't my plan --   it's
                  just what happened.
                      
                  Does anyone want to ask me   any
                  questions?

     The class nods but seems silently freaked out.


                  Let's get back to subtraction -- or
                  addition. Or both.




     Kate sits with Mr. Davies eating lunch.


                  Well, that was bound to happen at
                  some point. Kids notice things like
                  that.

     Kate nods.


                  But I had no idea how pro-life
                  little Winnie Reddy is.                        *
                      
                  Remind me to wear my "May the fetus
                  you save be gay" T-shirt to the
                  next banana split night.

     Kate half-laughs.




               And just think: the kids got a
               lesson about life and death that
               nobody planned on. I mean, you're
               years ahead of the standard
               curriculum for, uh, third graders.


               Does it matter that I lied? That I
               was never pregnant?


               You want me to answer that as a
               friend or as someone who takes the
               twelve steps very seriously?

     Kate shrugs.


               Well, the good thing is that it's
               all over now. Principal Barnes will
               think you're a martyr for losing a
               baby.
                   
               The kids won't ask about it anymore
               and as long as you don't toss your
               cookies again you won't have to
               deal with it.


                   
               And the bad news?


               You lied. To your boss -- and a
               bunch of small children. Who trust
               you. And rely on you to help them
               differentiate right from wrong.


                   
               That's all, huh?





     Kate and Charlie eat TAKE-OUT FOOD in SILENCE. Kate texts on
     her CELL PHONE -- not even paying attention to Charlie.


               Well...
                   




          ...I gotta say -- this is the
          boringest meal I've had in about as
          long as I can remember.

Kate doesn't look up.


          Who're you texting?


              
          Jenny.                                      *


          She's like a parole officer.


          She's my sponsor.


          I'm glad to know every little fuck-
          up I have is gonna become a topic
          of conversation with some chick I
          don't even know.

Kate finishes her text. Puts down her phone.


              
          So...what'd you do today, honey?


          I finished some writing and met up
          with Owen to watch the game and
          toss a few back. Dear.
              
          You do anything special?


          I lied to my class again. I told
          them that I had a miscarriage.

Charlie LAUGHS.


          That's not funny.


          Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up
          stuff is totally funny...in, you
          know -- a kinda fucked-up way.




        Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not
        actually having a baby.


        God, Kate -- come on. What else
        were you supposed to do?


        Well, I feel like a piece of shit
        for lying.


        It's not that big a deal. Jesus. Is
        this what those meetings teach you?
        To make drama out of nothing?


        It's not nothing. I lied to little
        kids and to my boss because I can't
        take responsibility for my actions.


        Why don't you go and tell the
        Principal that you were never
        pregnant? That the reason you puked
        is because you smoked crack all
        night? Would you feel better about
        yourself then?

Beat.


        I've been thinking about doing
        that, actually.
            
        Yeah. I think I would feel better
        about myself.


        Fine. Do it, then. I guess you
        don't need a job.


        I could be like you -- I could stay
        home drinking all day and never do
        anything responsible.


            
        I never do anything responsible?
        What about buying this house that
        we live in? Or the food that we're
        eating?




          Having rich parents doesn't make
          you responsible. I think it's
          pretty much done the opposite.

Charlie looks stunned.                                 *


          Oh, I'm sorry that I have a family
          that supports us -- and not the
          other way around.


          What the fuck is that supposed to
          mean?


          Nothing, Kate. But you can't be mad
          at me because my family has helped
          us out. You should be grateful we
          don't have to struggle.


          I wouldn't care if we struggled
          with money. I've struggled with
          money my whole life.
              
          I'd rather worry about where my
          next meal is coming from than if I -
          - in some drunken stupor -- married
          a man who just wants to party and
          meet bands.


          What the fuck are you talking
          about?


          I'm talking about you being a baby.
          A selfish baby.


          You know what?


          What?


          I fucking hate AA! It turned you
          into a bitch. A brain-washed bitch.


          At least I'm not drunk all the
          time.




               Yeah, you don't drink booze for
               three months and suddenly you're
               some saint? You have it all
               together and I'm just a baby?

     Kate doesn't answer.


               I'm trying, Kate. I'm trying to
               understand you. But it's hard.
               You're different and maybe it's
               good that you're different. Maybe
               I'm bad and bad for you or
               something -- because I didn't think
               the person you were before was so
               awful. I loved that person. Yeah,
               she drank a lot and she did some
               silly things...but she was my Kate.


               You loved that person? Do you not
               love me now?


               Yeah, of course. But it's
               different. You're different.


               Before I was a mess.
                   
               I'm finally getting my life
               together -- and you loved me more
               before?

     Charlie looks at the floor.


                   
               Kinda, yeah.

     Charlie looks like he immediately regrets what he said.




     Kate follows Jenny from her patio to her kitchen as she          *
     cleans up.                                                       *


               I feel so fucking weird right now --
               Charlie doesn't love me like he
               used to and I've lied to my
               students multiple times.




                  
             I just don't feel...normal right
             now.


             Well, you're not normal.
                 
             None of us are.


             Everything in life isn't connected
             to being an alcoholic.


             I'm not just talking about
             alcoholics.
                 
             People are fucking weird. We all
             have a lot of shit we carry around
             in our heads that doesn't make
             sense.
                 
             At least alcoholics have tools to
             work through it.                            *


             "Steps"...


             Yeah, steps -- and talking and
             listening and crying...


             I have the crying part covered.


             I know, right? I think my first
             year I cried tears I'd been saving
             since I was eight.
                 
             It's hard to live your
             life...honestly. You know?

Kate nods.


             Any idea what you're gonna do about
             your school situation? What you're
             gonna say?

Kate shakes her head.




               I don't know what I'm gonna do
               about anything.


               Listen...you wanna stay in my guest                     *
               room tonight? You can watch movies,
               get some good sleep...?


               You sure that's okay?


               Yeah, of course. That's why I spent
               money on a guest bed -- so people
               could sleep in it.
                   
               I know it might feel like it, but
               really, you don't have to figure
               everything out tonight.
                   
               You've got time.




     Kate goes into her classroom and finds a NOTE on the desk.




     Principal Barnes hugs Kate.


               I'm so sorry, Kate.
                   
               I haven't told many people this,
               but when I was young -- younger
               than you...I lost a child too.

     Kate's stunned. Looks like she feels terrible.


               I'm...I'm really sorry.


               It's okay. It was a long, long time
               ago. Still hurts sometimes. But
               eventually...you move on. You have
               to.
                   
               Have a seat.

     Kate sits down.




          I got a phone call from a very
          upset parent. That's how I found
          out about...you know. Frankly, I'm
          not sure why you didn't feel like
          you could tell me.


          I freaked out -- a student asked
          why I wasn't fat and I just froze
          up and then another student was
          saying I killed my baby and I
          didn't know what to do.


          I'm not angry with you -- but I
          need to be clear that this doesn't
          happen again.


          It won't. I promise that.


          By "not happening again," I mean
          that you don't discuss any
          controversial topics -- things the
          school board deems "family matters"
          with your class.
              
          No sex. No god. No drugs and
          alcohol.


          Okay, I...

Kate straightens up in her seat, takes a deep breath. She
seems...exhausted.


          ...I can't keep doing this. I feel
          awful.


              
          I know this all must be hard for
          you --


          No. You don't understand.
              
          I have to be honest with you.


          What do you mean?




          Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever
          pregnant.

Principal Barnes looks shocked.


          I lied -- to the class and to you --
          because I was scared.


          But...you vomited in class.


          I know. And when that happened I
          didn't know what to do because the
          truth is --


          Oh, my god -- are you really ill?
          Is it cancer?


          No, well, yes. I have a disease,
          but, um...
              
          ...it's alcoholism.

Principal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry.


          What?


          I've been working on it. I'm one-
          hundred days sober. When that
          happened I'd been out drinking and
          was hung over and --


          You vomited in front of children
          because you were hung over?


          Yes.


          And lied, saying that you were
          pregnant?


          Well, a student asked if I was
          pregnant -- and "yes" just kind of
          fell out of my mouth.



Principal Barnes looks disgusted.


          That's sick, Kate.


          I know.


          No, I don't think you understand
          how wrong that is. To lie to me --
          to the children. You know I felt so
          terrible for you when I found out
          that you had a mis -- ?
              
          -- how can you play with people's
          emotions like that?


          I was sick.


          Jesus...you told us you had a
          miscarriage.


          I'm sorry.


          I threw you a baby shower.


          I'm really sorry. I am. I've been
          wanting to tell you the truth
          because honesty has become really
          important to me. I'm in AA now and
          doing the steps and working with a
          sponsor and everything.
              
          It's really hard. I mean, I think
          my husband might hate me, and --


          I'm sorry, but what you did is
          totally irresponsible.


          I know.


              
          I can't have you here anymore.




              
          Am I being fired?


          No, no -- the state wouldn't allow
          that without a report. I'm not
          going to write a report. Because,
          frankly, I have no idea what that
          report would say.
              
          But I'm forcing you to take a leave
          of absence and I think it's in your
          best interest if you find a job
          elsewhere.


          Listen -- I'm really sorry, but I'm
          doing the right things now.


          I believe you -- or I want to. I
          really do. But honey -- I believed
          you before.
              
          I'll have a sub take over your
          class starting tomorrow. It's late
          enough in the year that we can just
          say you're having personal problems


Principal Barnes looks at Kate.


          -- which seems to be the truth.


          Principal Barnes --


          Not another word. I'm upset right
          now -- very upset -- and I think
          I'm doing you a favor by not
          reporting you.

Kate struggles to say something, to try to explain herself
but no words come out until she musters --


          Thank you.

Kate stands, defeated, and leaves the Principal's office.





     Kate glumly marches down the stairs -- holding a BOX filled      *
     with some of her things .

     Mr. Davies stops her.


               Kate -- what's going on?


               I told Principal Barnes about
               everything.


                   
               What? Everything? Did you tell her
               about...?

     Mr. Davies gestures to Kate's crotch.


                      
               Huh?
                   
               Oh, God -- no. I told her that I'm
               an alcoholic. And that I lied. And
               she fired me.


                   
               Oh...
                   
               ...my god, Kate -- I'm sorry.


               I've been going to AA and trying to
               be sober and this is what it got
               me.
                   
               Fired, for telling the truth.

     Mr. Davies awkwardly puts his arm around Kate's shoulder.


               I'm sorry. I wish there was
               something I could do.


               I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a
               fuck up. I'm just like my mom.




                   
               No, no -- you're a wonderful, smart
               woman Kate. You can't let this get
               you down.


               I gotta go.

     Mr. Davies takes Kate's box of things from her.


               Let me walk you to your car.

     Kate throws her arms around Mr. Davies and begins to --

     -- full-on SOB.

     Mr. Davies seems flustered and a little scared but tries to
     comfort Kate.




     Kate cries as she drives.

     She glances in the backseat at --

     -- all the baby shower gifts --

     -- and sobs even harder.




     Kate walks into a near-empty, depressing dive. She nervously
     sits at the bar.

     The BARTENDER -- a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled      *
     up -- approaches.


               What do you need?


               Whiskey. Double.

     The bartender gives Kate her drink. Kate immediately downs
     it.


               Can I have another one?




          Sure -- you gotta pay for the first
          one, though. Eight bucks.

Kate puts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL down.

The bartender pours her another shot.



Kate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- she's curled up
at the bar, nursing her BEER.


          Look, Miss -- I don't wanna be a
          downer or anything `cause I take it
          you've had a bad day, but um... I
          think you need to go home.


          Why?


          Cause you're pretty drunk -- and
          it's four p.m.


          What about him?

Kate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar.


          You're not kicking him out.


          I'm just trying to be a pal.


          Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I
          just got fired, and I just quit AA.
              
          It didn't work.


          Oh, boy...


          You know what? I was fine -- had a
          husband that loved me and maybe I
          sometimes did embarrassing stuff,
          but it was a phase.




          I go to AA and sober my husband and
          I start fighting and stop fucking --
          and sober I get fired! Isn't that
          what's supposed to not happen?


          Wow, okay, well...I'm real sorry.
          But this place gets a little nuts
          after sundown and I don't think a
          pretty girl who just left AA should
          be here.
              
          I'm gonna call you a cab.


          NO! I don't want a cab. I want --
              
          -- drugs. Can you hook me up?

The bartender rolls his eyes.


          C'mon...let's go out back and smoke
          some crack.


          Lady, you're done.


          You think I'm above smoking crack?
          `Cause I'm not. And are you really
          gonna tell me you're not a little
          attracted to me...?

Kate leans across the bar, trying to look "seductive" -- but
she just looks like she might fall off her bar stool.


          No.


          Just a teensy bit...?


          Not in the slightest.


          Well...you might want to consider
          investing in glasses, buddy. `Cause
          I'm a...a stone cold fox. And I'm
          smart. And I'm...

Kate begins to cry.




               ...a good person.


               I think it's time for you to go
               home. Now are you gonna let me call
               a cab?


                   
               NO! I'm not. I've got friends.
               They'll pick me up.


               You do that.


               I'll call Mr. Davies. He has dreams
               about me.

     The bartender takes a long look at Kate -- as though he's
     trying to size up if she's insane.


               Hope that works out for you.


               Can't believe my luck. I just want
               to get drunk and a bartender won't
               let me.
                   
               Life is stupid.

     Kate stands up -- almost falling over -- and glares at the
     bartender.


               You hear me? Life is FUCKING


     Kate goes over to the old man at the end of bar, winks at
     him, then picks up his drink and chugs it.




     Kate is slumped in the back seat.

     In the front seat is Mr. Davies and Jenny.                        *


               Davey-wavey...I called you. Why'd
               you bring her?




                We're worried about you, Kate.


                    
                Parole officer.


                She's your sponsor.


                It's gonna be okay. You stumbled.
                You'll get back up.

     Silence.


                How `bout we drive to Mexico and
                party our asses off? My treat.

     Jenny and Dave glance back at Kate --                          *

     -- whose face reveals what a bad state she's in.


                    
                Sounds fucking stupendous, right?




     Kate gets out of the car.                                      *

     Mr. Davies and Jenny watch with concerned expressions as --    *

     -- Kate stumbles to her front door.


                Kate! Are you sure you're --


                    
                Fuck off.





     Charlie plays a VIDEO GAME -- with the TV hooked up through
     his STEREO SPEAKERS.

     Kate opens the doors and walks in, wobbly.




              
          Babe -- you gotta hear this with
          the speakers hooked up. It's
          insane.

Kate says nothing. Just stares at Charlie.

Charlie looks up -- and is surprised to see Kate clearly
drunk.


          Whoa...what happened to you?

Charlie stops playing the game.


          I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job.


          Oh, no...


          We got any drinks?


          Uh...we have soda. I can make
          coffee.


          Don't be cute with me. You know
          what I mean.


          So...I guess you aren't doing the
          AA thing anymore?


          What gave that away?

Kate turns and goes to the kitchen --

-- reappearing a moment later with a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA, salt
and limes.


          Come on, baby -- let's do some
          shots.


          What's going on?




          I'm celebrating. What the fuck does
          it look like?

Kate takes a shot.


          Are you gonna be a little girl or
          are you gonna drink with me?


          I don't know what the right thing
          to do here is.


          Okay, so let me see if this makes
          sense: you say you miss the old
          Kate -- the Kate who drinks and
          blacks out and has fun.
              
          Well...here she is.

Kate smiles -- but she looks more desperate and drunk than
fun.


          Baby, I didn't mean that. I was
          just being a jerk.


          Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now
          you won't drink with me?


          I don't know. Having a beer or
          something is one thing, but...I
          think you really may have a
          problem.

Kate LAUGHS.


          Well thanks for all the support
          when I was trying to be sober!

Kate takes another shot.


          I'm sorry. I didn't realize --


          Of course you didn't realize! You
          don't fucking care about me.




          What are you talking about?! Of
          course I care about you. I love
          you.

Kate takes a shot and approaches Charlie.


          I love you too. Love is the easy
          part. It's the rest of the shit
          that's hard.

Kate kisses Charlie.


          Take off your pants.

Charlie gently pushes Kate away.


          Look -- I think you should get to
          sleep. You're really wasted.


          I don't wanna sleep. I wanna fuck.

Kate pulls Charlie -- who struggles -- down to the
couch...and straddles him.


          Please, will you stop?


          No! I want you to fuck me!

Charlie calmly tries to move Kate off of him.


          Really. This is weird.


          Be a man and fuck your wife!

Charlie -- who's creeped out now -- forcefully pushes Kate
off.


          No! Jesus -- what the fuck is wrong
          with you?

Kate has become quite angry and belligerent by this point --
and begins picking up HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS and throwing them at
Charlie.




          With me? With me?! What the fuck is
          wrong with me? I try hard and I get
          shit on! Fucked up family, fired
          from my job -- this marriage.
          Nothing's wrong with me! What's
          wrong with YOU?!


          Kate, you need to --


          What? What? What do I need? I can't
          drink because I'm crazy or
          something and I can't stay sober
          because of you!


          You're blaming other people for
          your problems.

Kate picks the tequila bottle back up, takes a sip, then --

-- runs at Charlie and tackles him to the ground.


          Stop it! You're acting like a
          freak!

Kate rips Charlie's SHIRT --

-- and holds the bottle over his head while straddling him,
as if she's about to hit him with it.


          No! What's wrong with you?

Kate holds the bottle in the air and looks hard at Charlie.
She begins to weep.


          I can't be sober and be with you.

Kate gets a flash of anger again and just as it seems like
she's about to hit Charlie with the bottle, she --

-- upturns the bottle and begins to chug the tequila.

Charlie tries to yank the bottle away, but Kate holds on
tight. With the bottle at Kate's lips -- and tequila pouring
down her chin -- the couple wrestles for control of the
bottle.










     Kate wears a UNIFORM and carefully works on a CAKE.                 *

     On the other side of the kitchen, Jenny makes APPETIZERS.           *


               How's it coming?


               You tell me.

     Jenny walks over and tries the icing.                               *


                                                     *
               Delicious.                                                *


                   
               Thanks.




     A middle-aged MAN stands at a podium in front of a medium
     sized group of PEOPLE -- about twenty-five or so, including
     Kate, Jenny, and Mr. Davies -- and says --                          *


               At this meeting we give cakes to
               celebrate sober birthdays. We have
               one birthday tonight -- for Kate,
               for one year.
                   
               Jenny and Dave are giving her the                         *
               cake.

     Kate hugs everyone -- then blows out ONE CANDLE on a CAKE
     before standing at the podium.


               Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic.


               Hi, Kate.




          I've heard that your best day
          drinking is worse than your worst
          day sober.
              
          Well...that is SO not true! I had
          amazing times drinking, dancing,
          and laughing...feeling like the
          most adorable, charming girl in the
          world. And I was adorable.
              
          I'd piss my pants, but I was still
          cute.

People in the crowd LAUGH a little bit.


          When I first tried getting sober, I
          figured that as long as I didn't
          drink...everything else would just
          magically work out. But it didn't.
              
          My marriage fell apart. I got fired
          from my job. And that shit happened
          SOBER! I never read that in any
          pamphlet...
              
          ...that isn't what I signed up for.
                
          Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty
          slogan I've heard in the rooms is
          that when you're sober for a bit
          and drink again "the disease waits
          for you, picks up where it left
          off."
              
          I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE
          those slogans. They all sound like
          bumper stickers. But, I have to
          admit...for me, that last one is
          pretty damn true.
              
          When I drink...I become another
          person. And that person is a pretty
          big asshole. Well, unless you want
          to give me drugs or buy me drinks --
          then that person is awesome.

People knowingly LAUGH.


          I wasn't happy being the "good-time
          girl," though. And honestly, I
          wasn't very good at it.




                   
               My life is really different than it
               was a year ago. I live alone. I'm
               bored a lot more. I have a job that
               pays a lot less.
                   
               I'm thankful for the program -- for
               my friends in here who took the
               time to help me and give a shit
               about me.

     Kate glances at Jenny and Mr. Davies.                             *


               There are people that used to be a
               part of my life that I miss -- a
               lot -- but...
                   
               ...I'm really grateful for this
               boring new life of mine.

     Kate smiles and steps down from the podium as people CLAP.




     Charlie, Owen, and a woman -- MILLIE -- stand at the bar,
     drinking BEER and WHISKEY SHOTS. Owen speaks -- but Millie
     seems way more into Charlie.


               I was in North Carolina for a while                     *
               -- Durham -- playing minor league
               ball. I had some real heat. That's
               when I met Crash, here.
                    
               He'd been sent down to single-A to
               teach me how to carry myself as a
               pro ball-player. We got involved
               with the same woman -- an older
               chick -- but Crash won her in the
               end.
                    
               He's really taught me
               some...important life-lessons.

     Millie nods.


               Wow...that's a pretty crazy way to
               meet.


               Yeah. It is.




          You guys are sorta like that
          movie...what's it called?


              
          I don't know. Which one?
              
          Do you know what movie she means?

Charlie -- who's pretty hammered -- shakes his head.


          "Bull"...something? What is it?

Charlie and Owen feign ignorance.


          Whatever. It'll come to me.
              
          So...what do you do now, Crash?


          I write about music.


          Really?

Owen gestures to a WAITRESS to bring THREE MORE SHOTS.


          Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of
          magazines. But print really is
          dead. So now most of my stuff winds
          up on websites. Which is
          depressing. `Cause you can't hold
          it -- you can just look at it. It's
          like...

Charlie seems lost in drunken thought. Long, awkward silence.
Millie puts her hand on Charlie's arm.


          Like what?


          Huh?


          You were talking about writing for
          websites and you kinda trailed off,
          honey.




              (trying to save the
               situation)
          So, Crash -- why don't you tell
          this nice lady about the 21 days
          you were up in "The Show," and what
          the crowds were like, and --


          It was crazy. I...

Charlie drifts off for a moment.


              
          I'm sorry -- I'm sure you're a
          great lady. You have lovely hands
          and hair but...

Charlie begins to walk away, wobbly on his feet.


          ...I'm gonna go to the...I'm just
          gonna go.

Charlie stumbles off.


              
          You want a ride...?

Charlie exits the bar.


              
          Um...is he cool to drive?


          Yeah, he'll be fine -- on his
          bicycle.


          He rides a bicycle?


          Oh, yeah --
              
          -- as a teenager, he was a bike
          racing champion growing up in
          Bloomington, Indiana. He and his
          friends were called the "Cutters" --
          and they beat a bunch of rich
          college kids in this big race. It
          was great.




                   
               Back then, I was a kickboxing
               instructor...




     Charlie rides his BICYCLE down the street. Swerving all over
     the place, he's obviously drunk.

     Red and Blue LIGHTS flash behind him. Charlie turns to see --

     -- a POLICE OFFICER.                                             *




     Charlie leaves Kate a VOICEMAIL MESSAGE.


                   (into phone; seems sort of
                    nervous)
               So, I got into a little trouble --
               drunk in public. On a bicycle.
                   
               Um, I was thinking...maybe I need
               to go to one of those meetings. I'd
               like to go with you, though. If
               that's cool.
                   
               Let me know if we could discuss it
               sometime, okay? Maybe you could
               come over to our -- um, my house?
                   
               Uh...yeah. Thanks.

     Charlie hangs up the phone.


                   
               "Let me know if we could discuss it
               sometime?"
                   
               Such an idiot...




     Kate and Charlie stand by Kate's car, which is parked in
     front by the street. She's just arrived. Awkward tension.


               Miss our house?




           Um...yeah. Sometimes.


               
           Miss me?

Beat.


           Sometimes.
               
           I've been sober for a year.


           Really?


           Yeah.

Kate reaches into her purse and takes out her ONE YEAR CHIP,
showing it to Charlie.


           They gave you that?


           Yeah. A couple of days ago.
           Tuesday.


           Oh...wow. Congratulations. That's
           really...really...just great. I
           mean it.
               
           Tuesday is the night I got pulled
           over.
               
           Parallel lives, huh?

Kate rolls her eyes.


           So -- you dating anyone?


               
           Charlie...


           Are you?

Silence.




          No.

Charlie seems relieved.


          Me either. Owen keeps trying to get
          me to be his "wing-man" and it's
          ridiculous and these girls in bars
          are so lame and I just keep
          thinking how I wish I was meeting
          you in a bar for the first time and
          I didn't come with any baggage and
          I could buy you a drink and flirt
          with you all night and ask for your
          number.
              
          Wanna go out sometime?


          I don't think it's a good idea.

Charlie nods. Long beat.


          I fucked up, didn't I?

Kate looks down, doesn't speak.


          Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a
          beautiful woman who used to love me
          and now when I see her she doesn't
          even want to look me in the eyes.


          Charlie, please don't do this.


          I miss you. I miss the way you
          taste and smell and...I miss things
          about you that used to drive me
          nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's
          music and fake punk-rock from the
          90's...


          I don't like shitty 80's music.
              
          I like good 80's music.




               ...and all I want to do is touch
               you one more time to just, remember
               -- to make sure it was real.

     Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a
     slight smile.


                   
               Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional
               fucking idiot.




     Kate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a
     number of items are missing, and it's messier. In general,
     the room looks more "dude."


               You look really thin.


               Yeah?


               When did you last eat?


               I dunno -- like...I'm not sure.
                   (seems slightly concerned                           *
                    that he can't remember)
               I think, um...


               Should we order something?


               Sure, yeah -- or I could make a
               bacon and egg sandwich...


               I don't know. I haven't really been
               doing the meat thing.


               Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then
               meat.
                   
               Have you given up fun, too?

     Kate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she
     finds him funny.




                   
               Sorry. Bad joke.

     Kate cracks a smile.


               Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But
               I'm gonna make them.

     Charlie raises his eyebrows.


               Okay...



     Kate's at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs.

     Charlie goes to the FRIDGE and gets a BOTTLE OF BEER.

     Kate glances at him.


               Sorry.

     Charlie puts the beer back in the fridge.


               I don't care if you drink a beer.


               You sure?


               Yeah. Whatever.


                   
               No...I'm good.



     Kate stands by the stove and watches as --

     -- Charlie -- who sits at the kitchen table -- wolfs down the
     bacon and egg sandwich.

     Kate seems pleased that Charlie enjoys it so much.




     Kate and Charlie play croquet.                                  *



They look a little tired -- like they've been playing a
while. Kate seems to be much better than Charlie.


             Have you been playing a lot?


             I haven't played in over a year.


             Then how're you beating me?


             I don't know. Innate talent?

They keep playing.


             I haven't met anyone even vaguely
             interesting since we separated.


             Um...stick to the game, okay?

Long beat.


             I've been masturbating like crazy.


             Charlie --


             I miss you.


             Stop it.


             Okay. Fine.

Beat.


             You could've been killed.


                 
             What?


             Riding your bike -- drunk.




          But I wasn't.


          But is that really the point?


          What are trying to say?


              
          I worry about you.


              
          Yeah, I can understand that. I used
          to worry about you. But now I know
          you're okay.
              
          That makes me happy...I mean, it
          fucking sucks that you're better
          off without me but I'm glad you're
          doing well.

No reply from Kate.


          Would you move back in if I came to
          meetings?


          You should go for yourself, not to
          make me happy.


          But, would you?


          I'm not moving back in.

That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear.


          Listen, I should go. It's gonna get
          dark soon.


          We can always turn the lights on.


          I don't know...

Beat.




          So, would you at least...let me
          take you out on a date?

Kate says nothing.


          Maybe...?

Kate shakes her head.

Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined.


          Okay...fine. 0 for 2.
              
          Last question: can we just...play
          one more game?

Kate doesn't answer.


          C'mon...you keep kicking my ass.
          It's embarrassing. You've gotta
          give me a chance to redeem myself.
              
          Please.

Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes...

...but she also doesn't say no.

There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes.
