                , My Friend.  You're pointing 
                a gun at me, looking in the 
                oth'direction, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK











                ..that you went into police work to
                control your rage....




                Well, that would be a poor choice,
                wouldn't it... 


                Tell me why...? 




                I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. 
                Because, you know, you can't understand. 


                Then tell me. 


                Well, you know, you know, you know, the
                 tell you.  Cause you 
                haven't .
                And that's all there . 



                ...and to have  it, means, can mean 
                to accept, not only , but 
                ...?


                ....that's right. 


                ..and ?  What is this new 
                job they've...? 


                No.  That's right.  That's all part of
                it. 


                Then, that being so, why is today 
                special?  Why have you come back to see 
                me?  Is it that new file they gave you? 


                I don't  so. 


                Then what brings you back? 


                I don't know.  Do  know...? 


                Yes.  I think I . 



                I think it is a phrase you used with
                that woman.  You told her you were an
                .


                You , to your mind, your most 
                private fears.

                ...you called up memories of your 
                to... 


                ...no... 


                ... with her.  To appeal to her,
                and you feel that... 


                No, I don't  so...


                It is  who have betrayed... 


                ...no.

                I want the  drink.  Cause it did me
                ... but I already drunk it, so,
                barring that, yes, I would like another.

                here, would  you.

                I'm sure, that's a "clue"...


                ....this is perhaps an inappropriate 
                ... but, I would like to say, it is
                an honor to meet the Woman who

                Well, now, you see, one of them's hurt.
                And what will make it better?  Love.
                Isn't that odd.

                He think's he's hurt his --but the 
                assurance, the assurance, the assurance
                that   
                Suggests the hurt was . 


                Mr. Verger, thank you for your time. 


                For the  hurt, of course, that 
                which will not heal, is the conviction
                no one cares.


                I've come to see you, sir, about an
                Auction... 














                Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter...
                And have they sent you, once again to
                 him?  How terrible for you... 


                No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why
                do you say how terrible? 


                Because we must leave the past  the
                past.   

                Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes,
                my own encounter with him...



                          VERGER  
                No, no.  That's alright.  Yes.  Lechter's
                drawings of me.  ... and, of 
                course, ... Now:  you are not sent
                to  him.  Then your visit baffles
                me. 


                Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. 
                Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the
                prison after his escape, have surfaced 
                and are being sold at auction.  Several
                large reserve bids have been placed on
                them.  I have to ask if you've placed
                those bids. 


                Because? 


                Because if it was not you, then, perhaps
                it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim

                ghoulishness?

                Yes, but we know who it was, and I will
                tell you, Agent Starling, what you know
                to be true.  I offered the bounty.  It
                was illegal, and, worse, it was . 
                And I thank God every day that I did not
                compound my sinful life by the stain of
                a murder.  Do you  Agent

                It would seem. 



                What if he came upon a note in, the 
                Capponi Library, this great Italian 
                Institution, which he now graces us with
                his bid to Direct, a note from Guido de
                Cavalcanti.  Would he recognize it, I

                Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's 
                first sonnet.  Do you know it, Professor
                Sogliato?  I believe it's worth your 
                time:  Listen to the way he makes an
                instrument of the Italian vernacular, 
                which he called the --
                the eloquent voice of the people: 
                Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core
                in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna
                involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la 
                svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa 
                umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea 
                paingendo.  If Dante had written to a 
                Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have 
                been to Andrea, the most literary of his

                And why is it a vacant exercise? 


                Because we both know who's buying the
                Lechteriana. 


                Who would that be. 




                Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. 
                Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it
                mirrors his soul, what an impossible
                injustice.  Can  be free....? 


                No, you're wrong about Verger. 


                Oh, yes.  He's found Peace. 


                Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly
                mistaken. 




                And have  found Peace..?






                What'll you do with the bird...?

                know what will happen to Kitty Cat?  When
                you go away.  The police will take her,
                and they'll give her a shot.  With a 
                shiny needle.  They'll give Kitty Cat a
                shot.  And it will hurt her.  And then

                Most current information shows the 
                result of an operation for the removal 
                of a sixth digit, the left hand of a man. 


                Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter? 


                Not with any certainty we... 




                Why did he come back?

                empowered to offer a reward of....






                ...are you alright, sir...? 


                HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM.  Where have
                we Seen it Before. 


                Seen what, sir..?

                THAT'S WHY THE CHILD TURNED BACK.  As
                Lechter will return back.  You see?  To
                the sight of his oppressor .
                He will return to savage our beloved Miss
                Starling.  Bring me a drink. 


















                Your drink, sir. 


                It's time to step up the pressure on

                Dr. Fell.  You are not Italian. 


                Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one
                of the few things in life which study
                and a pleasant attitude can not amend.
                What do you think? 


                And how do we account for the interest
                of such a charming man, an interest in
                Torture? 


                Dr. Fell is studying for his examination
                by the Studiolo. 


                Indeed I am.  And the connection, 
                between Dante, and, in fact, between 
                your illustrious forebears... if you'd
                come with me, I could show you...
