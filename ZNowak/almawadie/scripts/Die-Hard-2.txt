          JOHN MCCLANE, long topcoat FLAPPING, comes running out of the
          terminal towards an AIRPORT COP in plastic covered uniform who is
          supervising a TOW TRUCK DRIVER who in turn is manhandling a
          sedate sedan with Virginia plates and a "GRANDMOTHER ON BOARD"
          sign on the rear window.


          I'm here, I'm here, false alarm, let's
          just let her down nice and easy -


          Sure. At the impound lot.

          40 bucks, we give it back.

          BEEP drowns out his last word. McClave sweeps aside his coat,
          finds the beeper on his belt. He looks at the obviously
          unfamilar number on the read out in puzzlement, then runs into
          the terminal.



          CHRISTMAS MUSIC wafting through the building from a SCHOOL CHOIR
          perched in front of a massive, three-story window. Blase
          travelers PAUSE in their hectic rush to applaud the angelic
          voices.
          McClane shoves his way through some people - when they GLARE at
          him he quickly APPLAUDS the kids, pulls up at an INFORMATION
          BOOTH - the girl there is watching a LITTLE TV on the shelf out
          of sight from the public.

          A plane TAKES OFF. We PULL BACK and realize we're in a MOTEL
          ROOM. The TV is on and we SEE the TV PICTURE CHANGE to a
          TROPICAL AIRFIELD. Khaki-clad heavily armed SOLDIERS form a
          cordon as a stiff-backed handsome MAN of 60 in handcuffs and leg
          chains is hustled aboard a plane.


          Security was tight today at Escalon
          airport in the Republic of Val Verde,
          where government authorities escorted
          General Ramon Esperanza to the
          military transport that will bring
          him to the United States to stand
          trial for narcotics trafficking.
          A HAND thrusts in front of the CAMERA - FINGERS clenching and
          curling oddly.


          A half naked MAN is doing Tai Ch'i EXERCISES. This is COLONEL
          WILLIAM STUART, U.S.A.  His body is hard, with SCARS from
          knives and bullets.
          On the TV, the words "FILE TAPE" blink under Esperanza's IMAGE,.
          here resplendent in a Latin American uniform, reviewing troops in
          the field and then moving to a table under a tarp to sign
          documents with American military officers. He hands a COLONEL the
          pen just used on the document - a souvenir.

          its campaign against Communists
          insurgents - a campaign fought with
          American money and advisors.
          Esperanza's fall from power caused

          recent election, but closer to home

          PICTURE CHANGES to some WASHINGTON STEPS. The AMERICAN COLONEL

          officials were chargedwith supplying
          I him with weapons despite the
          congressional ban.
          The exercises finished, Stuart FREEZES in an eerie pose, until


          BEEPS an alarm -


          The man uncoils. Composes himself. Goes to the closet.


          But mounting evidence that Esperanza's
          forces violated the neutrality of
          neighboring countries made Congress
          withhold funds-funds which Esperanza
          I s accused of replacing by going into
          the'lucrative business of cocaine
          smuggling.

          other, all carrying SIMILAR GIFT WRAPPED PACKAGES.

          notice him.
          A beat after Mil ergs exit, two AIRPORT COPS in snow-flecked
          JACKETS come into the bar. Seeing, them, the bartender is
          already pouring coffee for them. But-

          from his ear. Equally casually, Garber Vs-Wed-If-is- foot to slide
          the two long Christmas package at his feet under the table.


           This gets his attention. His eyes narrow. He looks from the two
           or d inary looking men towards the Airport cops, wonders why they
           got fidgety. Now he watches


          who looks at his watch, signals Cochrane. Both rise. But as

          something dangles inside his jacket. Is it a holster?

          words with you?




          You can have two: "Fuck" and "you".
          And the interview is over and he's out the door.





          McClane's head panning the holiday crowd - then SEEING Cochrane.
          Quickly, he FOLLOWS Cochrane downwards - into


          where a TOURIST JUNKET gets between McClane and his quarry-


          a GLIMPSE of him at a door marked "NO ADMITTANCE" - then he's
          gone. McClane runs up, too late; the door is shut again.
          He looks around, sees a LUGGAGE WORKER, flashes his badge.


          Open this.

          Dark. Clatters and bumps, machine sounds... more bumps. McClane
          moves cautiously along. He JUMPS as a large SHADOW moves
          nearby, but it's a big CASE on a conveyor belt.
          Now, he stoops to go under another conveyor belt - the different
          tracks intersect and pass each other like freeway off-ramps
          discharging luggage from one to another - and then he SEES -

          The other one has one of those transceivers.


          Excuse me.


          They turn, see McClane with his badge in his left hand - his
          right hidden under the long coat which is draped over his
          shoulder like Clint Eastwood's serape in a Spaghetti Western.


          This is a restricted area. You boys
          too impatient to wait for the skycaps?

          Yeah? Let's see some ID -
          Instantly both men DIVE to the outside, drawing guns.


          Falls, skids... somewhere.


          Dropping his'wallet, McClane JUMPS aside as SHOTS WHIZZ PAST
          -McClane's COAT takes the BULLET HITS in MID AIR as he LANDS
          on a conveyor belt, which CARRIES him UP and OVER the gunmen.
          They FIRE UP at him - He aims.back - and then a SUITCASE falling
          from another belt and knocks his gun away!


          The gun CLATTERS on the floor. Seeing it, the two men exchange a
          glance - split up.


          Drops from the belt, crouches near big gears. Desperate, he
          looks around for a weapon, anything. Then he notices all the
          luggage going past: Suitcases, camera cases, a bicycle... Skis.


          Moving forward expertly, gun ready. WHAP! A SKI POLE smacks
          down on his wrist! The gun DROPS onto a conveyor belt, FIRES -
          then moves away, obscured by moving luggage.

          all the echoes - it's hard.




          Fighting hand to hand. Miller starts pressing the ski pole
          against McClane's throat:-Pt=lane tries to do the same thine

          Miller HOWLS, blinded - but then - BLAM! A BULLET EXPLODES
          tcan in McClane's hand!


          Cochrane is there! McClane LEAPS like Tarzan to the BOTTOM of
          the i , empty "return" belt - the momentum swings him right
          towards Cochrane, who FIRES once more before McClane's KICK
          nearly toc e stf'his head - he loses the gun, but Jesus, these
          guys are tough and now Cochrane LEAPS UP and grabs McClane's
          belt and clothes and they're both hanging -suddenly they're both
          too damn high to get off!


          Half on the belt, half off, he fends off the other man and SEES-


          The belt goes through a hatchway - a hatchway with virtually no
          clearance.


          McClane PUNCHES Cochrane - again, again - but the guy's gonna
          kill them both one way or the other - McClane KICKS him, again,
          again - finally his grip loosens - at the last minute McClane
          JUMPS to a thick conduit - and then Cochrane gets JAMMED




          The conduit BREAKS FREE from its molly bolts, but doesn't drop

          freight... starts to smile - there's a door just ahead - he's

          makes him turn -it's the CHING CHING OF -

          courtesy.


          In an airport Christmas week? You
          gotta be kidding.


          Okay. Forget the courtesy. How about
          lust the professional? Your boys
          dust walked away from a crime scene
          - you need to seal it off, get a
          forensics team in, dust it, shoot




          And what do we do with all the luggage
          for all the airplanes while we play
          Charlie Chan?



                         

                         

                         

                         






          You store them somewhere -


          Oh. And meanwhile every hour a few
          more thousand people come and they
          want to put their luggage on
          airplanes, so we store them and their
          luggage in some other "somewhere"?
          Hell, why don't we shut down the whole
          fucking airport? Whaddya think they'll
          say upstairs when I tell them that?


          Why don't you try it and find out?


          Because I don't need a forensics
          investigation to file away some punk
          stealing luggage -


          Luggage? That "punk" pulled a Glock
          Seven on me. Know what that is?
          A porcelain gun from Germany. It
          doesn't show up on airport x-ray
          machines... and it costs more than
          you earn in a month.


          You'd be surprised what I earn in
          a month.


          If it's more than a dollar eighty
          nine, yeah -




          McClane, don't start believing your
          .own press.
          (on McClane's look,
          waving the FAX) 
          Yeah, I know who you are, that
          Nakatomi thing in LA. Just 'cause
          the TV thought you were hot shit don't
          make it so. This time you're in my
          little pond, and I'm the big fish
          that runs it. Now you capped some
          lowlife, fine. I'll send your fucking
          Captain in L.A. a fucking
          commendation.
          He hits a BUZZER. Immediately two burly AIRPORT COPS appear in
          the doorway.



                         

                         

                         

                         






          Now get the hell out of my office
          before I have you thrown out of my
          airport!
          McClane moves towards the door, his hands waving off the would be
          bouncers.


          
          One question, Carmine: Which sets
          off the metal detectors first: The
          shit in your brains, or the lead in
          your ass?



          McClane comes out of Lorenzo's office, steaming. He walks down
          the corridor - looks back at one of the stocky Airport cops
          -fakes a smile - when the guy turns away McClane punches the
          wall.
          Then a CLATTER announces the PASSAGE of the morgue guys, the BODY
          on their gurney. McClane moves aside, watches them, thinking...
          getting an idea.




          the girl here lost in a romance novel-


          Excuse me.
          He reaches over, gently takes typing paper and a stamp pad.




          Hey!


          McClane catches up to the morgue guys as they reach their wagon.


          Whoa, guys.
          (ver quickly showing


          Gotta check something.
          Before they can react, he's UNZIPPED the bag, yanked out the
          guy's right hand.

          He presses the fingers against the paper, checks them. (The hand
          he's released remains straight up.)


          Yup, he's dead,. all right. Thanks.
          And he's gone as they look after him, puzzled.







          cruising along, its FIGHTER ESCORT a few wingtips away. Now, the
          fighter WAGS ITS WINGS and PEELS AWAY.



          CAMERA MOVES from the cockpit back through the rest of the plane.


          Ay, Alle va nos escorto.


          Es bueno; el peligro es pasado.

          Tres horas y media.
          By now we are on Esperanza. Looking astonishingly carefree, 
          he smiles at the young CORPORAL guarding him, puffs on a cigar... 
          and casually examines the military chronometer on his handcuffed 
          wrist. We PUSH IN on it. 





          WIDEN from Stuart's Huer, showing the exact same time. Now we
          SEE that the church is full of ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT: In fact,
          it looks very much like a mini-version of an airport control
          tower, complete with radar screens and a big glass board to mark
          positions on.



                         

                         

                         

                         






          CAMERA follows a MAN with a Pizza sized RADAR DISH as he crosses
          the room, a CRONY unrolling WIRE behind him.
          CRANE UP as the man CLIMBS into the STEEPLE... UP, UP, UP, until
          he's in the BELFRY where a PRERIGGED TRIPOD WAITS for the dish.
          As he CLAMPS it in place we SEE the yard behind the church and
          the SPARKLE of WELDING TOOLS; someone is making CONNECTIONS
          to the now open conduit box and underground CABLES.







          Excuse me, honey - can I borrow your
          office for a minute?
          Before she can answer, he's over the counter and reaching for her
          phone.





          The office he's in shows us that AL POWELL has moved up in the
          world - and Twinkies have move up along with him.

          550-3212. This is a first.


          Yeah, well my wife's company makes
          'em, I figure it's time to get one
          of them pregnant.
          
          This way?


          This way.
          The FAX starts to leave McClane - voila, it's already arriving at
          Powell's office.


          
          Fingerprints?


          From a stiff down here at Dulles.
          I marked the whorls with a pen in
          case the transmission's fuzzy. Can
          you run that through State and Federal
          for me - throw in Interpol if you
          got it.




          Will do. What's this about?


          I don't know. Just a feeling.


          Ouch. You get those feelings
          insurance companies start to go
          bankrupt.

          I don't think so.


          I only have to look at his face for
          fifteen more minutes.




          Ladies and Gentlemen, I've just been
          informed by Dulles traffic control
          that a new weather front is moving
          in ahead of us. We may be up here
          for a little while longer...
          GROANS. COMPLAINTS. Holly holds out her glass.


           Yes. Another.





          McClane paces, smoking. RRING. Both the FAX machine and the
          telephone light up. McClane beats her to it.


          Al?




          Right here, partner. Your stiff's
          dossier is coming through right now.

          No, you don't follow me. According
          to the Department of Defense, he's
          been dead for 2 years.


          What?


          Yup. S/Sgt. Oswald Cochrane.
          American advisor in Honduras, killed
          in helicopter accident 5/11/88.
          
          Read between the lines of his military
          record and it looks like a lot of
          black bag stuff.


          Yeah, I see it. Thanks a lot, Al.
          I owe you.
          He hangs up. The girl gives him the eye.


          Say, I close in an hour... maybe we
          could...


          
          Just the FAX,, ma'am. Just the FAX.



          McClane comes out, deep in thought - gets on an walkway.
          Suddenly the CLICK of HEELS makes him turn.
          Sam Coleman is trotting down the linoleum next to the walkway,
          trying to keep up with him.


          The Ghost of Christmas Past.

          Hey, I know how you feel about the
          media, but we're not all like that
          putz Thornberg - he crossed the line.
          That's why they canned him out in




          Yeah. Now he's on the Network
          interviewing Transsexual Gum Surgeons
          and laughing all the way to the bank.


          Okay. The guy makes Geraldo look
          like Walter Chronkite. Doesn't mean
          you can't cut me some slack. I saw
          the stiff. Word is that was your
          handiwork.


          Nah. I do needlepoint.
          And he's at the end of the walkway and he quickly disappears
          into the crowd, leaving Sam pissed, puzzled... and out of
          breath.



          Lorenzo has joined the regulars here to cover his ass


          -well, the press was here, crawling
          all over the Esperanza story... so

          I think something serious is going
          to happen here tonight -


          Hey. Something serious happens every
          night, only it doesn't make the
          newspapers. Ever see those guys
          on TV, juggling knives and cha n
          i saws? That's what we're doing with
          those planes up there, only we do
          it one handed 'cause the other hand's
          playing 3 card monte with the planes

          Dulles, what's going on? 23 -what the hell happened
          I'm in approach - - to you -?

           holding altitude. Stand by for instructions...




          Checked all systems. It ain't
          happening.
          And now, God help us, all REACT to ANOTHER ALARM.


          A CABLE yanked from the ground gets CUT, SPARKING -


          WHIP PAN to an ENGINEER -




          Approach control backup! It's gone!


          GLOWING FIBER OPTIC CABLE stretched like a sacrifice on a BLOCK

          Jacoby, Strauss. Get your controllers
          on the horn - every plane approaching
          our Vortacs that's not in our pattern
          yet gets turned away'now. Everyone
          already inside our patrn holds at
          the outer marker. Stack 'em, pack
          'em, and rack 'em. Move.
          
          I want every off duty controller and
          technician here in five minutes.
          Page the terminal - no, better, beep
          them.


          McClane. This what you were
          expecting?

          Maybe they don't.


          Maybe... it's them.


          
          Put it on speaker.


          Attention, Dulles Tower. Attention,
          Dulles Tower -



          Stuart is using a phone that's PATCHED IN to the cables ripped
          from the earth -




          I think by now I've got your
          attention. I know your recorders
          go 24 hours around the clock, so I'll
          be quick -you can play me back later
          all you want.





          How. did you get on this line? Who
          is this?


          Who I am is unimportant. What I
          want... well, if you don't want those
          planes overhead to start dropping
          like flies when they run out of
          fuel... what I want is very
          important.
          All REACT - McClane as much as anyone.



                         

                         

                         

                         








          A plane is going to be landing at
          this Airport in 58 minutes. It is
          FM 1 - Foreign Military 1.


          Esperanza?
          Trudeau nods -


          This plane is scheduled to be met
          by a continigent from the U.S.
          Justice-department. But now there
          will be a change of plans. This plane
          will not be met by anyone. It will
          land on a runway of my designation
          where it will not be molested. That
          will conclude my interest in that
          plane and your responsibility for
          it. At the same time, I want a 747
          cargo conversion fully fueled.


          As Trudeau tries to make headway with Stuart, McClave leans over
          to Barnes.


          What's all that about?


          A 747 has the furthest flight
          capacity of anything we've got here.
          Take out the seats and save some
          weight, add the wing tanks and it
          could go to Australia, Africa, Asia
          - hell the whole Goddamn world.'


          Meaning they pull Esperanza off his
          plane and take him anywhere there's
          no extradition treaties.


          They're talking to us on our own
          Goddamn system! They gotta be close
          - I'll have my men tear this airport




          About time, Carmine. Guess you have
          to light a fire under your ass to
          light a fire under your ass.



                         

                         

                         

                         










          McClane, I got a first class unit
          here, SWAT team and all, and we don't
          need any Monday morning quarterbacks.


          
          Monday morning? My wife's on one
          of those planes these aasstards are
          fucking with! That makes me a player
          on the fucking field, you putz! And
          if you got off your fat ass when I
          told you to, maybe we wouldn't be
          knee deep in shit right now!


          
          Security!
          
          You're out of here!
          And already two big Airport cops are trotting over. As Trudeau
          REACTS, unsure -


          Mr. Trudeau. Do I have to remind you
          about FAA regulations regarding
          unauthorized personnel in the control
          tower?




          See Mr. McClane out.


          It opens. Someone's inside., but we don't feature them yet.


          
          Trudeau, can't you see you're dealing
          with pros? You can't fuck with these


          Sam comes out of the elevator, holding up her ID.




          Sam Coleman, WNTW news. Mr. Trudeau,
          there's a lot of rumors flying around




          Oh, no, no way -



                         

                         

                         

                         








          This is off limits, Coleman, you know
          that!
          Together with McClane she's shoved into the elevator.


          Anything you can think-of, they'll
          think of, too!
          But the elevator DOORS CLOSE on him and now Lorenzo turns a KEY
          on the control panel, then SPEAKS into his walkie talkie.


          Lobby Security, come in.




          ,
          Tomlinson here -


          And Lorenzo here, with two
          unauthorized personnel in the fucking
          tower! Get your thumb out of your
          ass and get over to the elevator.
          Get them out and post a guard or
          you're gonna have a pink slip in your
          Christmas stocking!
          Rattled, the guard signals a comrade, hustles to obey.




          Anything who can think of? Can't
          fuck with.what guys?
          McClane punches buttons. But it's on override.


          Shit!


          Big drug dealer on the way to prison.
          Gunfight in airport. Every controller
          in the coffee shop getting beeped
          and hauling ass, and you rocking the
          boat. A connection? Come on, McClane
          -Just a few words -?

          How about "fuck" and "you"?


          I already got that from Colonel
          Stuart, thanks -!
          McClane STOPS as if zapped by a Taser.




          Stuart! The guy who got canned by
          Congress - that's who he was-


          Huh? Who he who?
          But McClane has already jumped up and grabbed the light fixture,
          and now in a gymnast's move KICKS out the ceiling hatch and
           disappears through the roof! 


           The door opens. The GUARDS there REACT to the open ceiling. 
           Sam shrugs.


           Claustrophobic, I guess.





          TILT UP from a big map of the airport. Lots of AD-LIB
          BRAINSTORMING, some of it breaking through - some how one reedy
          hesitant voice cuts through with nothing but confidence


          --guys, guys, all we have to do is
          find a way to transmit - 




          Yeah, right. Somebody run down to
          Radio Shack and get a transmitter-


          We have one.


          The new terminal wing they're
          building? Twenty airlines when it's
          done?





                         

                         

                         

                         








          All with their reservation computers,
          all tied into a nice big antenna
          array so they can talk to their home
          offices- it's just sitting there
          waiting to go on line -


          That's VHF - it'll scatter -




          Doesn't matter; The planes we want
          to reach are right overhead. I could
          rig our frequency in - 30 minutes...
          wire in a crossover and we're hot.
          The planes wouldn't even know the
          difference.


          Get what you need. Borrow, steal,
          kill.


          
          I want my Swat team to go with him
          as cover.
          
          Whatever we can think of - they can
          think of, too.
          He says it like he thought of it himself. Then -


          Attention, Tower. You have two more
          minutes to stack the planes in your
          inbound pattern over your outside
          radio marker. After that you will
          be able.to receive only. Any attempt
          to restore your systems will be met
          by severe penalties.
          At the elevator, Lorenzo pauses - stage WHISPERS -


          He's bluffing -
          Lorenzo leaves. Trudeau ain't so sure.




          Damn it, you can't do this -!


          I am doing this.



                         

                         

                         

                         




          
          Put me on all bands...
          Trudeau waits as switches are thrown, and then takes the jack
          from the ear/phone he wears and jacks it into a panel.


          This is Dulles approach to all
          aircraft holding.at Potomic Vortac.
          We are experiencing...


          Severe technical problems here.



          As CONCERNED CREWS in each listen to:


          Our NAV and Approach systems are
          down and we expect to lose voice in
          another minute. We want you to
          continue holding at the outer marker
          as directed and wait for further
          instructions. As - as soon as we're
          back on line we'll expedite your
          landings on a.fuel emergency basis.
          Good luck...


          God bless.
          He turns to a tech, face ashen.


           Okay. Change the boards.





          ANGLE ON a bank of ARRIVAL MONITORS. Already a quarter of the
          planes are DELAYED by weather; but now, in a domino like
          PATTERN, all the remaining FLIGHT DATA changes to DELAYED.
          CAMERA ADJUSTS to show PEOPLE REACTING with frustration and
          concern.





          Pretty dark and creepy for a place only 25 years old. A
          FLASHLIGHT BEAM PANS THE LENS. We SEE the two lobby guards as
          they search the basement. They move AWAY from the CAMERA.
          Pause.



                         

                         

                         

                         






          McClane APPEARS in the gloom close to CAMERA, clothes now a
          little greasy and dirty from his little escape.


          
          I don't believe this... another
          fucking elevator... another fucking
          basement... why does this always
          happen to me?
          He moves through the cavernous maze, and then REACTS to MUSIC.
          Moves towards it. And arrives in -


          Or something like it: Here, in an area reached only my somebody
          with a groundhog in his ancestry, is a space with some battered
          chairs, a 3-legged card table, a cot made up with faded but neat
          covers, some 50's vintage. PIN UPS,
          and a tiny kitchen precariously propped up on a big purple
          plumbling valve on the wall.


          The SOURCE of.the music, a 78 SPINNING on the old machine.
          McClane's HAND picks it up and we WIDEN as he looks at it
          curiously.
          A HAND reaches for McClane's shoulder.


          McClane's instincts take over; in a flash, he WHIRLS and his
          would be attacker is pinned against a wall. It's a wizened MAN
          in his 60's who now raises his hands to show he ain't looking
          for trouble.


          Who the fuck are you?
          In response, the man points to the NAMETAG on his coveralls.


          Marvin, I'm Marvin. Thought you was
          tryin' to steal my records, that's
          all.
          He moves to them, possessively.


          They're valuble, you know. Me, I
          like those old 78's. Won't find me
          switching like everybody else to these
          new fangled 45's.



                         

                         

                         

                         






          McClane reacts to that, peers at him.


          You're what, the janitor?


          Damn straight. Janitor, and proud
          of it. Don't need any of this new
          fangled custodial engineer crap.
          Just do my job and screw the fancy
          talk. You know, you're not supposed
          to be down here.




          Yeah. Just like you're not supposed
          to be living here.


          W-who said I was living here?
          McClane shows his badge.


          Come on, Marvin. I wasn't born
          yesterday. Carmine Lorenzo know you
          don't go home after you punch out?


          L-Lorenzo? C-come on, officer, I
          can barely get by, even with my
          pension. You know, I'm a vet, WW
          2? If it wasn't for guys like me,
          you kids' be eatin' sushi today.
          I'm just trying to. save a few. bucks
          -I could. get fired if you tell.
          McClane moves over to a big panel with telephone lines and jacks.
          Examines it as he speaks.


          I'm a veteran myself, Marvin. And
          a married one. You married?


          Six times.


          My wife may be in some trouble
          upstairs. I gotta find out. This
          set up of yours? I won't tell a
          soul... provided you patch me into
          this panel, 'let me eavesdrop on the

          Christmas tourists seeing guns and
          flipping out so they'll take him the
          long way around...


          We WIDEN as Marvin connects them to one set of bolts, then
          another. 'McClave shakes his head. No... no...yes!


          Through the annex skywalk to the new
          terminal... that way nobody sees them,
          we don't have any panic.


          And we don't want any disasters.
          Barnes has five minutes to check out
          that antenna array.


          
          Christ. They're gonna try something
          cute... where's this annex skywalk?


          Annex skywalk...? Sounds like the
          pissant World's Fair...
          He rummages around, finds a big wrinkled MAP, smoothes it out.


          Lemme see... yeah, must be this...
          connects to the new terminal -
          Marvin points to an ELEVATED WALKWAY connecting the two
          complexes.

          Anybody smart enough to shut down
          the airport is smart enough to figure
          this... it's a perfect place for an
          ambush...





          Barnes, nervous, throws things into a metal case.
          His fellow engineers watch, curious, as he EXITS with the FIVE
          SWAT COPS. CAMERA FOLLOWS the four men past -






          all of it useless, all of the operators watching their only hope
          Barnes.




          A MOUND of CRINKLED PAPERS is FLATTENED against the card table.
          We WIDEN, see it is an architect's PLANS of the entire Dulles
          netherworld, cribbed by Marvin and now festooned with his various
          multi-color jotes and notes.


          Now, see? Here's you. And here's
          the skywalk.


          Now, check this out...


          Tunnels.




          Like the Japs had all over Iwo Jima.
          That's where I got wounded. But we
          put those little twerps in their place
          once and for all.
          
          These are air ducts for all the
          terminals. Heating, cooling. Whole
          shebang.





                         

                         

                         

                         






           MARVIN -
          So I put you in the boiler room
          where they start, and you come out
          there.


          Looks like... maybe a mile. Easy
          jog.




          Uh-uh. It's a pisser of a crawl.
          And that's the easy part; firs
          you gotta be an acrobat.



          With a cordless drill, Marvin unhinges the access door. Last
          bolt, it falls with a sheet-metal SLAM.
          McClane WINCES as a BLAST of AIR hits him - and, as. perspiration
          breaks out on his forehead, we realize it's hot air.


          Whoa.


          Winter up there... Summer down here.
          He aims Marvin's flashlight down there, isn't enchanted with what
          he sees. He turns, takes Marvin's map.


          I owe you one, Marvin. How about
          a sixpack of malt liquor?


          How 'bout a case of Johnny Walker?
          
          Hey, I may be homeless, but I ain't
          tasteless.





          A big "history of flight" MURAL high on the wall here HALF
          FINISHED, ceilings PARTIALLY OPEN; A WORKER on the scaffold
          and THREE OTHERS on the floor still hammering and. fiddling.
          Barnes and the cops come in. Barnes looks OUT the WINDOWS here

          We're in the annex skywalk. I can
          see the dish! I'll call you as soon
          as it's hot for a protocol test.




          McClane moves forward - stops immediately. Looks up at Marvin,
          who GRINS.


          He's HIGH ABOVE the huge boiler room. The only way across is on
          a narrow beam.


          McClane takes a breath, starts across the beam. There's a scary
          moment at first but he gets quickly confident - a bit too
          ; 7-7 confident midway - he starts to lose his balance and all-but runs
          to the far end, JUMPS to safety.
          As he pulls himself up he HEARS Marvin CLAPPING behind him.
          With a scowl, McClane checks his map, pushes on.





          Barnes and the SWAT cops run forward, get on the SLIDEWALK;
          impatient, they run even while on it.


          reaches into the open slidewalk CONTROL PANEL-hits a SWITCH.

          the worker turns his-bwCk on them again.


          Hey! Put that back on!
          No reaction. The cop runs forward.

          real painters. He ha a GUN.

          A sitting dunk-. --�
          He SHOOTS him.


          The other three "workers" turn, and now we SEE that they are
          ,H S ELDQN, HS OCKLEY and MULKEY - Stuart's soldiers all.


          As bullets RAKE the slidewalk and PING off its walls, they JUMP
          over the railing &amp; take cover-another COP KILLED on the move.


          is CUT badly on the arm by flying GLASS - he CRINGES behind a
          dumpster while the three remaining cops EXCHANGE FIRE with the
          four soldiers. BULLETS hit near his metal case. He takes a
          77 deep breath - rescues it!




          in the TUNNELS, he tosses off his sweater into the darkness.
          Underneath, his shirt is already sweat-stained.
          And then he HEARS the gunfire - it's close! He gets his bearings
          -LUNGES through a wall of STEAM -




          a third airport.cop DIES. His partner KILLS the gunman
           who took out his friend, and then he's KILLED
          himself. The last SWAT cop breaks cover and gets CUT DOWN.
          Sudden SILENCE.
           Barnes suddenl alizes he's all alone. FOOTSTEPS approach him.
           He looks up. ulke is ri ht above him -


          Suddenly a VENTILATION GRATE by Mulke ' head KICKS OUT, sending
          the guy sprawling. McClane JUMP own, FIRING!

          bacTcwards, the bullets SPARKING off the grate before they drill
          through him.
          McClane ROLLS, FIRES a 'Reilly across the gallery, who takes 
          COVER. Then BULLETS hit all around McClane; he SEES






           McClane FIRES UPWARDS, and then VEERING, he RUNS UNDER the
           SCAFFOLDING - BULLETS PING off the metal behind him as a'Ae l
           tries to nail him from ground level - meanwhile 


           Shelf tries to SHOOT DOWN and UNDER. 


          deliberately SMASHES into the cross bars he passes, one after
          another, the SMACK of his body into them sounding like
          linebackers in combat -


          AIMS - but then the half of the SCAFFOLDING beneath him GIVES
          WAY. He FALLS, SCREAMING - LANDS with a CRUNCH beside Barnes-


          has a moment of satisfaction - then


          Oh, fuck


          He RUNS and DIVES SIDEWAYS as the rest of the scaffolding falls
          towards him, paint and glue and ha f the mural's tile grid coming
          down witWi t !


          lands, HARD, the plywood boards from the top of the scaffold
          SWEEPING him off his feet - his gun SKITTERS across the linoleum
          towards the far end of the slidewalk - he rolls over and SEES

          feet, already bending to grab his dropped MAC 10 rom the
          slidewalk - bringing it up - AIMING -


           McClane SPINS on the floor and SLAMS the nearest piece of the
           metal scaffold into the OPEN SLIDEWALK ELECTRONICS.
           It SHORTS OUT SPECTACULARLY and THEN -


           it WHIRRS into HIGH GEAR, TREAD SHREDDING -




          the slidewalk in OVERDRIVE, O'Reilly is FLUNG right over
          McClane's HEAD.


          He SLAMS into the wall at the end of the walkway HEADFIRST.
          There's a sickening CRACK as his neck goes and then he TWITCHES
          and slides to the floor, a SMEAR of blood on the slick wall.




           McClane takes a long overdue breath. Then he picks up his
          4 pistol, checks the'bodies to make sure there's no surprises,
           and, goes over to Barnes.


          You okay?.




          The antenna array -
          'Both look ,at it - and then


          The antenna array outside BLOWS UP, pieces SHATTERING the glass
          window. McClane and Barnes DUCK, but they're too far away to be
          damanged.




          Bait. Something to jerk you off,
          make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men,

          Thornberg, on an inside aisle seat, glances out the window. Sees
          something. Releases his seat belt. And goes over to the glass,
          pressing' .his nose against it like a kid in a candy store.


          LIGHTS in the sky: Other airplanes.


          Holly looks at him. She can't help not looking at him; he's
          practically in her lap.




          I think you're closer than fifty
          yards.


          So is that plane... practically.
          Despite herself, she looks out.


          Yeah. There's quite a few out there;
          we're in a regular traffic jam.


          There's nothing regular about it.


          I see you're intrigued. That's my
          gift, Mrs. McClane. I make people
          curious.


          Don't you mean nauseous?


          The people have a right to know, Mrs.
          McClane. You got in the way of that.


          You endangered my children... my
          husband.. and me.

          time you see the people is when you're
          climbing over their backs.





          McClane is doing a damn decent FIELD DRESSING on Barnes.


          
          --me? I'll live. But Lorenzo's 
          SWAT team is dead... and the antenna
          array is toast. Start looking for 
          a new miracle.
          AN EERIE ALIEN TYPE VOICE makes them both jump; McClane raises
          his GUN.


          It's coming from a TRANSCEIVER beside one of the dead men.
          Curious, Barnes slides over, picks it up. LISTENS with McClane
          to the GARBLED, spine-chilling NOISE.





          I say again, Annex team... report
          in. Annex team, report in.
          He looks at Stuart, concerned.





           Here, Garber no longer sounds human.


           What...?


          Some kind of scrambler so even if
          we scan their frequency we can't
          listen in. Descramble mode must
          activate on this code panel.

          Next time you kill one of these guys

          Kahn descends from the choir loft and joins Stuart and Grant.




          Sir, we just monitored a call from
          their chief engineer. Our people
          took out their Swat team...
          completely.


          You were right... they went for the
          antenna array. We're right on
          schedule.


          Except losing our own team wasn't
          part of the plan.
          He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice
          flat, firm, stern. Around and above him, his men hover over the
          improvised screens and terminals.


          Attention, Dulles. You were warned
          not to try and restore your systems.



           They listen, fearful -


          You've wasted lives and time on a
          futile and obvious target. Now you
          have to pay the penalty.


          They HEAR this too, over Barne's cellular tie in to the tower.
          McClane grabs it.


          There's five dead officers here,

          He stops, seeing the chilling look Trudeau is giving him.


          has reacted to both the mention of his name and of McClane's.
          His brow furrows. Ah, yes.


          McClave? John McClane? The...
          policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi
          hostages? I read about you in People
          magazine. You seemed out of your
          league on Nightline, though...


          Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous
          for five minutes. Saw you get shit
          canned by Congress on TV. How much
          drug money is Esperanza paying you
          to turn traitor?


          I think Cardinal Richlieu said it
          best: Treason is merely a matter
          of dates. And this country has to
          learn it can't keep cutting the legs
          off men. like General Esperanza -men
          with the guts to stand up to Soviet
          agression.


          And lesson one starts with killing
          policemen? What's lesson two - the
          Neutron bomb?


          I think we can find something in

          different than anything we've heard.


          Approach, this is one-fourteen.
          Where the devil have you been?

          Desperate, McClane runs to the spilled paint, grabs turpentine,

          We're sorry about the inconvenience,
          but we'll all be on the ground in
          a few minutes.
          The spent and exhausted people REACT. Some break into APPLAUSE
          and CHEERS of "HIP HIP." But one NICE ENGLISH GRANNY -clearly
          not an experienced air traveler - still looks TENSE. A
          STEWARDESS pauses to pat her shoulder reassuringly.


          Just like British rail, luv. May

          Barnes holds one end of.a painter's dropcloth; McClane - now
          wearing Barne's coat - DROPS out the broken window to the snow
          below.
          There he's a tiny SHADOW on the white field. He turns, RUNS
          across the. unlit airport... wind whipped SNOW quickly hiding
          him from Barnes.

          Christ. It's McClane. He'll get
          himself killed -


          He's made two TORCHES from wads of fabric wound on the scaffold
          pieces - now he uses his LIGHTER to ignite them. He WAVES the

          LUGGAGE tumbles in the CABIN - PEOPLE SCREAM -



          for a split second we HEAR the SCREAMS of men, women, children,
          and then all we HEAR - and SEE - is an EXPLOSION.


          As the plane breaks up and flaming debris SCATTERS.


          Behind the plane, watching the fireball roll away from him.
          He gives the scream of an. animal in a trap and falls to his
          knees.


          Everyone RECOILS at the explosion, which turns this room BLOOD
          RED with reflected light. CHUNKS OF METAL and PLASTIC boil
          through the sky. Something HITS the GLASS here, starring it and
          smearing it with what we hope is only grease.
          Somewhere SIRENS wail.




          Silence here, too. His men look at him. Except for ThampSm,
          who clearly enjoyed his part in the above, their faces are
          blank. Maybe they're admiring Stuart's incredible coolness.
          Maybe.




          That concludes our object lesson for
          this evening. If the 747 we
          requested is ready on time and General
          Esperanza lands unmolested, further
          lessons can be avoided.

          Firemen and medics scramble over a chaos of metal and fabric that
          used to be an airplane. WATER everywhere;- snow melted for a
          hundred yards around from the EXPLOSION.
          Pieces of luggage, fragments of people's lives: Toys, purses,
          books, a woman's bloody shoe.
          McClane weaves through the workers, glazed eyes looking at the
          plane.

          ever have.








          Esperanza glances at his watch. Then, with a slight grimace
          and moan, he begins.to massage his chained lower legs with his 
          cuffed hands.

          Bueno, joven, bueno! Tu eres un
          soldado excelente! Ahora, en vez
          del libertad - dame un fosforo?
          Flattered, the kid lights him up.





          In the silence since the crash, no SOUNDS here, except the faint
          MONITORING of the Tower and aircraft chatter and the muted AUDIO
          of a TV. Garber breaks the silence.


          Sir. They've done everything we've
          anticpated... so far-
          Stuart smiles tightly at the unvoiced question.


          Don't worry, Captain. If this goes
          into extra innings...


          Well, we'll just call an our man in
          the other team's locker room.

          the clear glass board. CAMERA PUSHES to the TELEVISION.

          heard or saw the crash, but still
          there has been no official word from
          authorities. Meanwhile - despite
          the fact that only one runway has
          been closed due to the tragedy,
          several dozen airliners are visible
          from where I stand, endlessly circling
          the field. Rumors abound that somehow
          the accident has interfered with
          normal landing procedures here.

          contributed to it. One thing is
          certain: With weather conditions
          worsening, the problem here and in

          Their BREATH clouding inside the still cold JEEP as it BOUNCES
          along. Garber shines a FLASHLIGHT into the falling snow,
          illuminates a snow-covered runway number sign: "EIGHT WEST."
          The miltary plane ROARS overhead!


          BLAM! BLAM! McClane shoots off the lock apparatus of the grid!
          A RICOCHET PINGS off one of the grids hydraulic hinges and
          McClane winces as metal splinters sail by. Then he begins to
          muscle the heavy grid upwards.


          A FIELD of SNOW and ICE. But now a BLACK RECTANGLE EMERGES from
          it - it's the TUNNEL GRID, SNOW falling through it - the damn
          thing must weight over 300 pounds - McClane gets his head and
          shoulders up and out. Looks at -


          about to hit the runway -


          McClane pushes upwards - grunts - when he shifts his grip his
          SKIN RIPS on the cold metal - with a grimace, he pushes his
          rifle out, starts to follow -


          the damaged hydraulic hinge suddenly SNAPS with a squish of thick
          fluid.


          the 300 pound grid THUDS down on McClane's back. He GROANS,
          stunned.


          SCREECHES down on the runway!


          A) MCCLANE - dazed, trapped, he looks up and SEES -
          B) THE PLANE - 1/4 mile away, coming right towards him-



                         

                         

                         

                         




          C) MCCLANE - struggling - still PINNED to the
          runway like a bug in the Natural History Museum.
          Now we HEAR the ROAR of the. jet's ENGINES -
          D) THE PLANE - 1/8 mile away -
          E) MCCLANE'S FEET - still in the tunnel, they GROPE
          for leverage on the steps -and SLIP! Now they kick
          away at AIR -


          It's.coming, coming, COMING. Desperate, McClane sees that part
          of the rifle is half under the grid. Now, he puts all his energy
          into levering the rifle against the steel.
          Slowly, slowly, sweat breaking out on his forehead, he levers the
          rifle higher and higher, the rifle in turn levering the grid
          upward, an inch at a time finally, it's high enough for him to
          JAM the rifle's bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch
          of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole.


          McClane DIVES OUT OF THE HOLE.


          McClane rolls away from the wheels, which miss him by inches.
          The PLANE SMACKS into the half-open grid, which goes FLYING, the
          plane hardly dented, the rifle SNAPPING like a toothpick, the
          scrambler CRUNCHING like a bug
          McClave kisses asphalt, WINCES at the SCORCH of jet exhaust five
          feet over his head.


          Skids roughly to a stop a hundred yards away.
          McCl:ane:gets to his feet, sucks in air - and heads for the plane.


          Close enough to SEE the plane as it STOPS -




          There -!



           Esperanza secures the controls, moves to the doorway and spins
           the wheelock. It opens with a HISS and the steps DROP DOWN.

          McClane's FIST smacks in, knocking Esperanza back from the door.




          McClane comes up the steps, gun leveled at the startled fugitive.


          Thought you'd pull this off, didn't
          you? I guess you didn't count on
          me being here. Actually, I didn't
          count on me being here.


          W-who are you?


          Just a cop who's spent half his career
          busting scumbag lowlife dope dealers.
          Looks like it's business as usual.
          Think this will look good on my
          record?
          Suddenly BULLETS PING on the hatch inches from McClane's head.


          No.
          NcClane 'DIVES and rolls into the cabin - FIRES TWICE out the door
          and then almost on instinct whirls -
          Esperanza's snatched up the rifle from the dead corporal but 
          McClane's SHOT hits him in the SHOULDER. With a HOWL, Esperanza
          falls backwards but hangs on to the gun.


          GARBER and another man are there, rifles UP -


          McClane FIRES, blowing a hole in h m so ' THROAT, and as 
          Garber's slugs come closer, McClane IVES into the cockpit,
          BULLETS smacking all around him from Garber and Esperanza -

                         

                         

                         

                         




          McClane SLAMS the door behind him, LOCKS IT. BULLETS PING into
          the door, which INDENTS from the hits which don't penetrate it.


          GARBER helps Esperanza down the steps. Stuart runs to him.


          General!


          
          I'm all right - he said he was a
          ,policeman...


          A policeman -
          PUSH to Stuart. He knows which policeman...


          He went in the cockpit -


          He's going to hell.


          Silence. McClane REACTS to the.two dead men sharing the tiny
          space with him... the SNOW and GLASS everywhere... and then he
          crawls to the door, gingerly tries it.
          IT WON'T MOVE. He tries harder.


           A RESCUE AXE is across the door like a barricade.


           McClane looks worried - and then




           McClane! I assume it's you, McClane. 



          Stuart, Esperanza and two of the others ring the nose of the
          plane, weapons out.
          Garber - the last man - comes up, delayed by locking McClane in
          the cabin.

           And he OPENS FIRE. The others instantly join in.


          McClane DUCKS as FIVE MACHINE GUNS BEGIN TO RIP THE PLACE APART.
          What's left of the glass IMPLODES, and ricochets begin SLAMMING
          around the room - McClane eats floor, but the snaking lines of
          bullets criss cross the cockpit, searching him out -




          Glass rakes his forehead, blood misting his vision - He crawls
          N to the door - throws his weight against it - nothing -


          Having decimated the front of the plane, Stuart signals and now
          they flank the sides. What's left of the window glass reflects
          their FIRE like a Fourth of July show - Esperanza alone SMILES as
          he shoots -


          he's HIT in the left hand.




           How many grenades we have?






           Use 'em.
           Pop. Pop pop pop. Each man PULLS TWO PINS - THROWS - Then they
           run for their jeep, carrying the body of their comrade- 


          Clunk-clunk-clunkCLUNK. TEN GRENADES land and BOUNCE here like
          hailstones from hell. They SIZZLE. McClane rolls over and
          suddenly SEES -


          CAMERA PUSHES to it: "EJECT."

                         

                         

                         

                         




          in one move vaults into the seat, snaps on the belt, grabs the




          with a WOOSH and a ROAR, the ejection seat ROCKETS UPWARDS, the
          steel vanguard above McClane's head PUNCHING THROUGH what's left
          of the canopy.


          the cockpit EXPLODES! It's all so FAST and EYE SEARING we're not
          sure if McClane is clear - but then we SEE


          No sound, now, just the WHOOSH of the air going past - the
          ejection seat is TUMBLING -






          WHOMP! The 'chute OPENS with violent YANK.




          Christ!
          He DROPS from frame.


          At the jeep, Stuart and his men REACT as WATER from MELTING SNOW 
          runs past their feet. Garber POINTS to the ghostly image of
          the 'chute, half a mile away -




          But Stuart turns at the SOUND of SIRENS.


          The calvary is coming... and it's not his.




          Fall back to the Church! Now! 
          Helping the wounded Esperanza, they vanish into the darkness.

          He staggers out from under the yards of silk, COVERED IN SNOW
          -fights the vertigo from his flight - runs off.





          The stewardess sticks her head into the cockpit.


          They're getting pretty squirrely back
          there... in fact, so am I.


          We're right over Washington... see
          if you can get any TV. That'll settle
          'em down.

           She STOPS. She's SEEN


           Almost on EMPTY -


           She REACTS. No one says anything. She composes herself... goes
          out.



           Holly types a line on her computer. Then she REACTS to the 
          SOUND of crumpled paper. CAMERA ADJUSTS as she looks at
          Thornberg. He's LISTENING to the TAPE RECORDING with an earplug
          and then drafting his own document.
          He crosses out a line, adds a word - looks at it proudly. 


          
          Boy, am I good...


          Writing your acceptance speech for

          Try Pulitzer, Mrs. McClane.
          But now that stewardess reaches up and turns on the TV PROJECTOR.
          As the lights DARKEN, Thornberg decides this is perfect cover.
          pretending he's getting a blanket overhead, he slips his credit
          card in one of airphones. Then he moves down the aisle, phone
          I inside his jacket.


          Sir, please - we may be landing at
          any moment -the seat belt light is-


          I- I'm going to be sick -
          He makes a croaking noise to sell it, stumbles into the lavatory.


          
          This is Richard Thornberg. Put me
          through to the News Director.


          I know he's getting ready for the
          broadcast, that's why I want him!
          Now get him or start typing your
          resume!





          The DOCTOR patches McClane's right hand; one of the soldiers
          gives McClane a cigarette.


          Esperanza's down... but he's hurt.
          I killed one more man... that's six 
          they've lost all together.




          Maybe if we knew how many they had
          to start with, we could get excited.
          But if they got fifty guys, it's a
          little early to break out the 
          champagne.


          McClane, we don't need a loose cannon
          on this deck. What if they decide
          to crash another plane in retaliation
          for your little stunt?

          the situation would be over.


          Maybe they're more creative than you


          think! McClane, we're here to jerk
          off that cocksucker until he tries
          to take off - period! This time
          you're the wrong guy in the wrong
          place at the wrong time!
          McClane stands, glares at the two officers. He flips away the
          cigarette, walks away, pissed.


          .The story of my life.
          But the enlisted men seem sympathetic. And so does


          Who now pulls McClane aside.


          McClane. You said they showed up
          there right away?


          Stuart's guys? Yeah. That means
          they're on the field or close -


          I think I know where.
          Interested, McClane'follows Barnes around the corner.


          Barnes unfolds some.plot plans.


          These are the old plans when the
          longer runways went in... that's
          twelve years ago. And it looks like
          they did some modifications on site...
          moved Tracon, phone, ILS - all the
          underground stuff -so they could
          handle drainage. If I'm right, all
          of it would run along the edge of
          the airport property - and go right
          past this neighborhood.



                         

                         

                         

                         








          So - if they know this too - they
          could be sitting around the fireplace
          and hanging their fucking stockings
          in one of these houses?


          Maybe. Yeah. Well, seventy eighty
          per cent, five percent either way-


          Are you sure or not?


          I was sure about tying into the
          antenna array. And... and I got
          five officers killed.


          You didn't do that - you did your




          I had a choice and I made it. But
          those cops didn't have a choice, and
          neither do those soldiers now. I'm
          an engineer, McClane. It's supposed
          to a wires and circuits... iron
          and steel. Not flesh and blood.
          Not lives. If...if I'm wrong again...
          I don't want anyone else to get
          orders that could get them killed.


          
          Then how would you feel about a
          volunteer?





          The passengers' patience has begun to frazzle. The Older Woman
          beside Holly is no exception.


          Somebody ought to get their ass kicked
          for this mess, that's for sure.


          It's hard to blame anyone for the

          Scott?


          I shoulda taken the bus. At least
          they can pull over for food and gas.


          I REACTS to what the woman's said. As the Stewardess PASSES, Holly
          signals her - RISES halfway to meet her.


          Yes?


          I... was just wondering. Our flight
          was only supposed to.be 5 1/2 hours- 


          Do we have enough fuel for all this
          endless circling?
          Pause. The Stewardess" face eases into an official smile.


          Oh, of course we do. They anticipate
          little proems like this.
          She moves away. We TIGHTEN on Holly. She's chilled by the lie.
          Worried, she TURNS... looks at the AirPhone. X)




          HIS BEEPER SHOWS as he CLIMBS something - we WIDEN.
          He and Barnes are outside a HOUSE that backs up to the Airport.
          Both peer over the fence. It's a modest DC suburban tract job.
          People TRIM a TREE. It could be Norman Rockwell.


          Hell. These people are hanging their
          Goddamn stockings.
          They DROP down into the snow, CRUNCH to the next fence. Look

          r.� 55A NEW ANGLE 255A
          They've come to a corner; now they go back to the street, spread
          Barne's map out on the hood of Barne's still humming CAR. Far
          behind them, we SEE the illuminated airport TOWER, centered in
          the dark blot that should be brightly active runways.
          Barnes reaches inside his jacket, fumbles in his jammed plastic
          pocket thingie for a little flashlight. He checks the map.


          Four more possibles. Three houses...
          and a church.
          They cross the intersection on foot, walk over a lawn. It's
          further to the next place; more prosperous yard. Suddenly
          McClane puts up his hand -Barnes stops - both look at -


          Baker is walking, almost casually, around the rear of the house.


          McClane and Barnes huddle, whisper.


          Could be a sentry -


          And he could just be out for a walk-


          Then why is he going over his own
          footprints?


          Indeed, gar's steady progress has made a trench around the
          church property, and the distinctive PRINT of his galoshes now
          makes double images.






          Stay here. Get ready to call the
          marines.




          I thought they were Army.




          Who the fuck cares, just be ready.



                         

                         

                         

                         




          Saying this, McClane takes his own gun from his holster and puts
          it in the back of his trousers... then moves off.
          Barnes takes out a cellular phone, lurks under a tree.


          moves from shadow to shadow and tree to tree like an Indian
          I stalking a settler... closer... closer...





           Holly drops her credit card in the airphone. Starts to DIAL.




           Baker is only a yard away. Closer - closer - and then -BEEP! 


           Instantly whips his head around, the hidden MAC 10 coming up, but
           E he winter outerwear slows him. McClane. DIVES on him. 


          REACTS, begins to dial the phone. REACTS to


          The dial reads NO SVC.






          He raises the antenna, realizes he's got to move - runs towards
          the street.


           CRASH into the fence with a CRACK. McClane ha Baker gun 
           hand and SLAMS it down on the fence n -again
           -blood wells - the gun DROPS ker OW", taking McClane away 
           from the weapon -They trade bru unches -

                         

                         

                         

                         





           Through the rear window here we SEE the fence GIVE, and bend 
          AGAIN, but the SOUND is muffled by the WIND and the GLASS.





          Lorenzo WRITES as Grant REACTS -


          You're where - you crazy idiot, why'
          didn't you -


          He's down the block, STANDING on a snow covered car -


          Just get here,.this is it, move your
          fat ass will ya -?
          Grant signals his Sergeant and then it's like D-Day as ALL the
          SOLDIERS and some COPS hustle out -




           halfway to their feet, the snow bloody between them s3ke 
           KARATE KICKS McClane back into a tree, dazing him---Baker jumps 
          in, RIPS McClane's coat open and -
          GRABS for the holster! As his hand comes up empty, McClane
          GRINS, head butts him!




          AIRPORT POLICE CARS and the ARMY TRUCK SKID AROUND A CORNER-



          Soldiers on the benches - Grant standing, rocking like a commuter
          - Telford, only one unarmed, still MONITORING the radio -


          Gentlemen. We have... a situation
          here...
          CLICK CLICK SNAP. AMMO CLIPS are broken out - all PIGGYBACKED

          Baker yanks a combat knife from his boot and'DIVES on McClane
          -bo i HIT the wall of the church's detached garage -SNOW and
          ICE fall from the roof, but both men ignore it -
          McClane's LEFT hand can't force awa� akers RIGHT hand and
          the KNIFE.
          The bastard is STRONG and now his left jumps out and pins
          McClane's RIGHT so-it can't help-- The knife creeps towards
          McClane's throat! McClane is fucke -and then his desperate eyes
          look at something nearby -
          We FOCUS CHANGE - it's a big ICICLE -with his last strength
          McClane.BREAKS out of Baker's grip, grabs the icicle-
          -and STABS it RIGHT in Baker's EYE!


          Baker SCREAMS and falls back - McClane ROLLS with him and with
          both hands PRESSES the ICICLE HOME SIX MORE INCHES right into the
          son-of-a-bitch's brain.
          The body TWITCHES, DIES. McClane falls against the garage as the
          snow turns CRIMSON all around. Catches his BREATH... and then
          REACTS to a WHISTLE.


          is in the street. Moving in a crouch, McClave heads towards him.
          Barnes points to


           their truck far down the street, they move forward silently and
           expertly, shadows starting to surround the church.


           Grant and Lorenzo come over.


          McClane, what the hell do you think
          you're doing, playing John Wayne?
          How'd you like to spend the rest of
          the night in a cell -






          shut the fuck up and do something
          useful. Seal off the street.


          You can't talk to me like that -

          out of Mr. McClane's face.


          With pleasure, sir!
          I And Lorenzo is HUSTLED away. McClane takes out a cigarette.


          I was wrong. You're not an asshole.


          i 
          No, you were right. I'm just your-
          kind of asshole.

          Close up the back, then we go in.
          Fire only on my order.
          McClane and Barnes watch as the soldiers start to close the net.


          moves forward on the lawn into a PRONE FIRING POSITION - and then
          his GUN MUZZLE hits a TRIP WIRE in the SNOW!


          Stuart's men REACT to and ALARM - instantly go to ASSIGNED JOBS!
          Some grab weapons ,others.SMASHthe EQUIPMENT HERE! Esperanza,

          Everyone DIVES for COVER as a STAINED GLASS WINDOW is BROKEN and 
          a rifle POKES out. GUNFIRE lights up the street, REFLECTS on

          Looks all around - all change their ammo clips, putting ones with
          blue adhesive tape into their weapons --and then they RETREAT
          Tr-om the front windows. We PAN them out the REAR and to the
          FENCE behind the church - which they SMASH THROUGH.


          taking cover behind a parked car, he HEARS the SOUND of




          Fuck...


          They're. pulling out!
          And he's on his feet, FIRING his pistol, here outclassed by the
           assault rifles -


          Grant signals his men - they FOLLOW McClane, RUSH the church
          -there is NO MORE FIRE from the.front - some of the men SMASH
          through the doors, others run alongside the church -


          Stuart leads his men and Esperanza towards what LOOKS like BUSHES
          about 30.yards behind it but as M .L].,ar and 8r reach them
          and grab at FABRIC we REALIZE it is a SNOW CAMOUFLAGED TARPULIN.


          McClane is first here - DUCKS as GUNFIRE erupts ahead of him
          -then he FIRES at the MUZZLE BLASTS in the darkness - then REACTS
          to the SOUND of GASOLINE MOTORS -


          as Stuart and Esperanza and the remaining men ESCAPE on hidden
          SNOWMOBILES ! McClane FIRES twice at the


          Garber is on it - McClane's BULLETS rip through his CHEST -as he
          falls off it SPINS OUT, ROLLS OVER.


          The Airport police crash in behind the tailing soldiers. Barnes

          hidden under a panel.


          Got one here, too - looks like C-4
          and the mother fucker is primed-


          Evacuate! Now!



           the soldiers and Barnes rush out, bowling over Lorenzo just as
           he's heading in. As all dive into the snow -


           The church EXPLODES, stained glass windows givingthedestruction,
          an eerie BEAUTY as they SHATTER -


          As debris RAINS DOWN, everyone struggles to their feet. Lorenzo
          spits out snow, looks around.


          Hey. Where the fuck is McClane?




          He's riding the snowmobile that cracked u , carrying the dead
          man's assault rifle like the Duke on a horse!


          He's coming up on the rear of the other vehicles!


          Big BOUNCE over a mogul. As the 'mobile settles, McClane pulls
          the rifle forward. He STEADIES IT alongside the WINDSHIELD of
          the snowmobile.

          UNTOUCHED. But he LOOKS back at the SOUND of SHOTS. HAND
          SIGNALS his flanking riders.


           Two of them PEEL OFF; Kan, riding double with ESPERANZA; VAX&amp;, 
           riding alone. Burke SWTTfCHES AMMO CLIPS to a red taped clip.




           Shit!
           He AIMS at the APPROACHING SNOWMOBILES -FIRES -


           Again, UNTOUCHED! Now as he SWEEPS past Esperanza FIRES his




           McClane DUCKS as bullets BLOW OUT his WINDSHIELD. He SWERVES
           -and there's the other snowmobile that turned. Burke FIRES 
           on FULL AUTO


          RIDDLED with BULLETS, McClane's snowmobile CAREENS OUT of CONTROL
          - goes'AIRBORNE - McClane TUMBLES from the seat - and the 'mobile
          EXPLODES against a runway WIND REGISTER.


          He looks back at the mini-FIREBALL, signals his men to regroup.
          All DWINDLE in the landscape of the empty airfield.

           glass, jacket ragged, body bruised, he should be looking for 
           a doctor.
          Instead, he's pawing through the snow - looking for the assault
          rifle. And finds it, the stock broken. McClane pulls off the
          clip. He peels off a round into his hand, then another.
          There's PAPER WADS where brass should meet lead. 


          Blanks... blanks?
          .Paleing, he rummages in the snow, finds one of the soldier's
          backpacks. More clips inside. First clip has live ammo. Second
          clip - blanks CAMERA PUSHES in on McClane until he looks at
          the red/blue tape and -makes the connection.

          Stuart and his men, on foot near the halted snowmobiles. LIGHT
          in the distance; hangers; the terminal.


          It is. It's in hanger eleven. 
          That's the most remote building we've
          got.
          Stuart looks at his map, then the hanger mentioned; not far.


          We're on our way. If there's another
          attempt to stop us like the one-you
          just made, I will fire several Stinger
          missiles into your terminal. Do I
          make myself clear?


          Quite clear.

          Yeah. Then we wouldn't have to do
          this.
          And in a flash, Grant DRAWS his combat knife and SLITS the kid's
          throat!
          Telford FLOPS BACK off the bench. Grant is already digging into 
          the cargo pocket of his trousers and he comes out with a
          transceiver - the same distinctive scrambled transceiver used by
          Stuarts men!




          Eagle Nest, this is Hatchling. On
          schedule and in place.



          Stuart holds his transceiver while he looks up at the plane
          prepared for him. One of his men comes out, gives him the thumbs
          up sign.

           in his car, gives them a thumbs up.

          This is a special bulletin from WZDC 
          News. There was a plane crash earlier
          this evening at Dulles, where other
          aircraft continue to circle, with
          no explanation from Airport or FAA
          officials. Now, with an exclusive
          KLA report, here is Dick Thornberg,
          reporting from the skies over
          Washington.
          That gets all the sports fan's attention. Now a SUPER of I
          TH rnberg's FACE comes up in the corner of the newsroom.




          Tom., I'm one of the thousand people
          who has been circling our Nation's
          capitol, under the assumption that
          whatever problem was going on far
          below me was a normal one. But the
          truth is far from normal - the truth
          is terrifying.





           People walking along.- and then jumping out of the way of- 


           MARVIN drives, happy as hell; beside him, in the seat usually 
          reserved for the sick or elderly, is McClane, slowly coming back
          to normal from his ordeal.






          This is a recording of a conversation
          between Dulles tower and the captive
          aircraft overhead.
          With a smug smile, Thornberg plays the tape again.

          The golf cart SKIDS to a halt at the receptionist's desk.
          Lorenzo comes thundering out of his office.

          mind-?

          that unit with his own guys -

          As the TAPE RECORDING CONCLUDES, the patrons are in SHOCK.
          Already several begin to RUN OUT.
          CAMERA PANS AWAY from the terminal bar towards a GIFT SHOP.
          There, all the PORTABLE TV's ON DISPLAY are BROADCASTING the SAME
          THING. A CUSTOMER hearing this DROPS a CRYSTAL VASE.


          
          Since then this reporter has learned
          that the terrorists have virtual
          control of the entire airport - a
          fact the authorities have suppressed.
          The terrorists promise more bloodshed
          unless their demands are met; and
          now that special Army Commandoes have
          arrived at the airport, the liklihood
          of a full scale and deadly battle
          is dangerously close -

          McClane is in Lorenzo's police car; a DOZEN other police cars
          full of officers behind, lights SPINNING. Lorenzo leans out the
          window like Ward Bond on Wagon Train.




          Converge on Hanger 11 on all four
          sides! When the city blues get here
          with their backup, they can pick up
          the pieces! MOVE OUT!
          
          McClane, you meet my nephew?
          The other guy in the car is the asshole who towed the car. As
          McClane REACTS, the caravan ROARS FORWARD, SIRENS WAILING -


          And Lorenzo's car SMASHES into a TAXI. CAMERA CRANES UP and we
          SEE that the police cars have run smack into the PANIC in the
          front of the airport.

          watching the scene, trying to get it on video.

          A WOMAN SCREAMS. A MAN tries to get out of his seat and a

          Then something else sinks in; she looks at the empty airphone
          cradle on the wall gets quickly out of her seat - in mid-stride
          she STOPS - takes her seatmate's PURSE. Then, she sidesteps
          some panicked people, goes to the kitchen area.
          And finds one of the special keys for the lavatories.






          And so it continues: A standoff
          between terrorists and authorities
          with the lives of thousands at stake.
          But at least this time, in this place,
          the truth, at least, is not among
          the hostages because Richard 
          Thornberc put his life and his talent 
          on the line for humanity and country. 
          Behind him, Holly silently opens the lavatory door.


          .,and if this should be my final


          WHAM. She ZAPS him with the old lady's TASER. He TWITCHES -
          DROPS! She picks up the phone. 


          Amen to that, asshole.
          
          We're sorry, but Mr. Thornberg is
          experiencing electrical problems.
          We now resume our regular programming.





          McClane, Sam and the cameraman, forcing their way through the
          crowd; Sam ABSORBING what McClane's told her.

          Stuart GRINS, signals for the hanger door to be opened.


          The big door RUMBLES UPWARDS. There's the truck, headlights
          now ILLUMINATING the waiting plane.
          Grant jumps down from the cab, gets a warm greeting from Stuart
          in the headlight beams. Grant salutes him, then pivots to salute

          He looks out the window - and REACTS to -


          Hydraulics GROANING because McClane is JAMMING his JACKET into
          the groove where it hinges!


          They can't fucking believe this. Then -




          i I'll do him.


          
          You just get us in the air, General.
          You're the only one who can do it.





          Stuart and Grant cock their weapons, move to the door. Grant
          opens it.



          , Grant stands there, WIND whipping him. NO MCCLANE - just the
          jacket, FLAPPING in the groaning aerilon.
          Grant starts out - WHAM! McClane APPEARS from behind the door,
          TRIPS him! Grant's gun BOUNCES off the wing, falls to the
          ground rushing past below!


          in the doorway, tries to AIM - but


          are INDISTINGUISHABLE in the driving snow.


          Each HOLDING ON TO THE WING with one hand - FIGHTING with the
          other - Grant POUNDS AWAY on McClane's face - but McClane
          doesn't HIT BACK - he just GRINS like a maniac - PUSHES Grant
          -pushes -pushes -

          Too - bad - McClane -
          The SOUND of metal SLIDING - a KNIFE APPEARS in Grant's hand-




          I really liked you -


          too late, he realizes he's over the front edge of the wing! He
          screams and FALLS -


          RIGHT INTO THE ENGINE INTAKE! There's an awful GRINDING SOUND -A
          SCREAM - McClane winces as RED SNOW SPLATTERS HIM -


           it could be hamburger pouring out - but before we can dwell on
           it, the engine pod BLOWS!


           wipes red snow from his arm.




          I like you better dead.


          a "FIRE" indicator goes on. Esperanza hits "EXTINGUISHER",
          handles it - increases power to the other engines.


           trying-to SEE - finally - a GLIMPSE of what has to be McClane
           -with a savage grin, Stuart takes off his rifle - discards the
           bulky coat - knife in hand, he steps out.


           moves hand over hand to a trailing section of the wing. Looks
           over and down at



                         

                         

                         

                         


          He reaches for it. Too far. Stretches. Gets it - fucker is
          TIGHT. Wincing, he TURNS it a bit - then LOOKS up just in TIME
          to SEE STUART, knife whizzing DOWN -


          McClane ROLLS, but the knife CATCHES his SHOULDER. In pain, he
          manances to KICK Stuart's KNEE - Stuart FALLS, almost goes over
          the wing - McClane goes back to work on the fuel port -it,TURNS
          another 1/4 turn -and then he has to abandon it to deal with
          another CHARGE from Stuart.


          he TURNS the PLANE. Now he's ON THE RUNWAY PROPER.


          FIGHTING for the knife. With.all his strength, McClane JAMS
          Stuart's knife hand the aerilon crack! The next WIGGLE of the
          metal CRUNCHES both hand and knife! Stuart SCREAMS and loosens
          his grip on McClane, who PUNCHES him away, goes back to work
          on the fuel port!
          But he's hardly at it when Stuart RECOVERS, and, mangled hand
          held clawlike, KICKS McClane's INJURED SHOULDER -KICKS AGAIN
          -blood on Stuart's shoe - McClane is being worked over the edge
          of the wing! He CATCHES at the last moment - now he IGNORES
          Stuart's BLOWS, because -


          .McClane feels for the fuel port - turn, turn - it OPENS! Fuel
          SPIGOTS DOWN - McClane feels the wetness on his hand -


          a RIBBON of FUEL twists behind the moving plane, slick and light




          Stuart STOMPS on McClane's HANDS on the wing - CRUNCH -STOMPS
          again - McClane SMILES -and then Stuart KICKS HIM OFF THE WING!


          DROPS 20 FEET, SLAMS into the snow at the edge of the runway,
          bounces like litter thrown from a moving car - the big REAR TIRE
          almost rolls over him -


          with a victorious SHOUT he YANKS the coat from the aerilon,
          throws it away - heads for the door -

          crawls to a painful sitting position. Face impassive, he watches
          the jet move away... and - incongrous as it seems - he lights a
          cigarette, looks off at - 




          running along the runway for 1/4 mile now -


           battered like a car wreck victim, now he looks up into the dark
           sky trying to find the SOUND OF JET ENGINES. Then he SEES -


           careening down in a desperate fight, against gravity -


          1 McClave takes a LONG PULL on the cigarette until the tip is




          about to close it, he looks back and for the first time SEES


          winding endlessly down the runway -




           Hey, Colonel: Happy Fucking New Year.
           And he THROWS THE CIGARETTE INTO THE FUEL.


           SEES the flame RACING TOWARDS HIM - turns to SHOUT to Esperanza -






           RESPONDS to the cry, GUNS IT -

          But as the craft rises, so does the FLAME, climbing the fuel
          ribbon RIGHT INTO THE SKY and TO THE NEAREST ENGINE which




          TURNS at the EXPLOSION in time for a WALL OF FIRE that SHOOTS UP
          THE WING and through the cockpit FLOOR, and then he's ON FIRE




           is BLOWN TO LITTLE PIECES as a FIREBALL BLOWS RIGHT OUT THE DOOR.,
           taking all the remaining soldiers with it and then


           It EXPLODES ITSELF, WINGS and TAIL and BODY going nine different
           directions!




          DIVES for the ground as the explosion ROLLS TOWARDS HIM.


          they watch the FIREBALL in the distance -


          Gets to his knees, and LOOKS at the huge conflagration.


          
          Honey... there's your landing lights.





          Blackness and driven SNOW outside - and then - in an almost
          cinematic FADE - through the glass we SEE the BURNING WRECKAGE
          -and, more importantly - the LINE OF FIRE RUNNING CLEAN AND
          STRAIGHT for almost a mile -
          A line right along the runway.


          Look - !
          The pilot grabs controls desperately, trims the plane -

          It descends, a bit erratic, but now it's ALONGSIDE the line of
          fire, coming in from the wrong end of the runway, and then the
          wheels BOUNCE, once, twice, and then a tire BLOWS but the pilots 
          HOLD IT as it SWERVES and finally SKIDS TO A HALT, turning onto 
          the grassy field.
          Already we HEAR RESCUE SIRENS.




          
          One forty is down! They used the
          fire to see -


          I -they used the fucking fire to see!


          They can all do that - let's tell




          They already know. Listen.
          And sure enough, there it is - the SOUND of ENGINES -



          And now the lights come down from the sky, in a neat and patient
          row, the closest-filling the screen, the others dwindling down to
          the size of stars.


          Stumbles along, maybe thinking he's dead or dreaming... IGNORING
          the giant PLANE LANDING BESIDE HIM, ignoring the FLAMES beyond
          that - His concentration is totally on Holly's plane -now
          another giant PLANE SKIDS down behind him - it's an assembly
          line, like B-29's coming home from war - then he SEES what he's
          praying for - breaks into a RUN -


          Holly - HOLLY -HOLLY!


          HEARS this just as she goes down the RESCUE CHUTE, ushed by
          Stewardess controlling their own tears -

          groggy, he raises his hands in supplication to the stewardess.
          She steps over him, puts her high heels back on - walks off.




          It CRUNCHES DOWN on the frozen earth near the runway. Sam and
          her cameraman hit the ground running. SEE -


          embracing - and then she's nursing his wounds, hearing his story-


          The cameraman brings up his lens.


          God, that's beautiful -


          Yeah. It sure is.
          And she yanks out his power cord, watches it dreamily.


          as rolling stairs are put up to the planes and the passengers
          pour down the steps into arms of friends, families, loved ones.


          Sets Holly down, kisses her - then both TURN at a HONK.
          Marvin is there in an airport cart. He looks at the chaos.


          Damned if I'm cleaning up this mess.
          McClane and Holly get in the cart. Marvin drives them away,
          light BLINKING... and we PULLBACK until McClane and Holly are
          just part of the crowd.
