               In baseball, you don't know nothing.

               Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better 
               learn baseball.

               You could look it up.

               Titles over --



               A series of still photos. Black and white. Ancient.

               BABE RUTH SWINGS -- An icon of American history. His giant 
               upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet. The 
               huge bat in an elegant follow-through...



               TY COBB ROUNDS THIRD -- The most vicious ballplayer of them 
               all, a balletic whirling dervish.



               JACKIE ROBINSON STEALS ROME -- Yogi Berra applies the tag.  
               Too late.



               JOE DIMAGGIO WITH HIS SON in the Yankee clubhouse. Walking 
               down the runway, Joe in uniform. Number five.



               A WALL COVERED WITH BASEBALL PICTURES behind a small table 
               covered with objects and lit candles. A baseball, an old 
               baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar -- 
               also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora 
               Duncan. Clearly, the arrangement is -- A SHRINE -- And it 
               glows with the candles like some religious altar.

               We hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent.


                         I believe in the Church of Baseball.
                              
                         I've tried all the major religions 
                         and most of the minor ones -- I've 
                         worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, 
                         Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and 
                         Isadora Duncan...

               PAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room. Late afternoon 
               light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a 
               small dressing table. A WOMAN applies make up.

               ANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face. Very pretty, 
               knowing, outwardly confident. Words flow from her Southern 
               lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern, 
               National and International borders. She's cosmic.


                         I know things. For instance --
                              
                         There are 108 beads in a Catholic 
                         rosary. And --
                              
                         There are 108 stitches in a baseball.
                              
                         When I learned that, I gave Jesus a 
                         chance.
                              
                         But it just didn't work out between 
                         us. The Lord laid too much guilt on 
                         me. I prefer metaphysics to theology.
                              
                         You see, there's no guilt in 
                         baseball... and it's never boring.

               ANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the 
               door. She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps.  
               She sits on a bench and


                         Which makes it like sex.
                              
                         There's never been a ballplayer slept 
                         with me who didn't have the best 
                         year of his career.
                              
                         Making love is like hitting a baseball --
                         you just got to relax and concentrate.

               ANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up 
               her calves as she does.


                         Besides, I'd never sleep with a player 
                         hitting under .250 unless he had a 
                         lot of R.B.I.'s or was a great glove 
                         man up the middle.
                              
                         A woman's got to have standards.

               SHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side.  
               Like a little girl showing off her new shoes.


                         The young players start off full of 
                         enthusiasm and energy but they don't 
                         realize that come July and August 
                         when the weather is hot it's hard to 
                         perform at your peak level.
                              
                         The veterans pace themselves better.  
                         They finish stronger. They're great 
                         in September.
                              
                         While I don't believe a woman needs 
                         a man to be fulfilled, I do confess 
                         an interest in finding the ultimate 
                         guy -- he'd have that youthful 
                         exuberance but the veteran's sense 
                         of timing...

               ANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official 
               scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick.


                         Y'see there's a certain amount of 
                         "life-wisdom" I give these boys.
                              
                         I can expand their minds. Sometimes 
                         when I've got a ballplayer alone 
                         I'll just read Emily Dickinson or 
                         Walt Whitman to him. The guys are so 
                         sweet -- they always stay and listen.
                              
                         Of course a guy will listen to 
                         anything if he thinks it's foreplay.

               ANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly, 
               in her cleavage.


                         I make then feel confident. They 
                         make me feel safe. And pretty.

               ANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress 
               along her hips. And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses. 
               Stylish and slightly mad.


                         What I give them lasts a life-time.  
                         What they give me lasts 142 games.  
                         Sometimes it seems like a bad trade.
                              
                         But bad trades are part of baseball -- 
                         who can forget Frank Robinson or 
                         Milt Pappas, for Godsakes!
                              
                         It's a long season and you got to 
                         trust it.

               ANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove





               A frame house with porch and lots of trees -- a Thomas Wolfe 
               house... with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway.

               ANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic, 
               old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood. In the b.g. other 
               people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM 
               BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head.


                         I've tried them all -- I really have --
                              
                         and the only church that truly feeds 
                         the soul -- day in, day out -- is 
                         the Church of Baseball.





               Now visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium 
               carved into the center of an old Tobacco town.

               People are arriving on foot from all around...

               "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air.

               CLOSE ON A BASEBALL CLOWN -- MAX PATKIN, 60, at home plate 
               doing his famous Bill Haley routine. A comic pitcher's windup 
               full of twists and goofy choreography.


                         One o'clock, two o'clock, three 
                         o'clock, rock... Four o'clock, five 
                         o'clock, six o'clock rock...

               ANNIE SITS DOWN IN HER PRIVATE BOX SEAT -- Her chair is wiped 
               off by a young black boy, JACKSON, 11, who then sits next to 
               her. He is her employed errand runner, note sender, and 
               friend.

               A GROUP OF GROUPIES ENTERS THE PARK -- 20 year old girl/women, 
               dressed in tight pants, tight everything.

               Friendly, eager, innocent -- THEY WAVE TO ANNIE.

               FIVE PLAYERS' WIVES AND THREE SMALL CHILDREN sit in a special 
               box seat behind a small sign "Players' Wives".


                         Seven o'clock, eight o'clock, nine 
                         o'clock rock... we're gonna rock 
                         around the clock tonight





               As Max Patkin continues his routine, players warm up, and -- 
               THE MANAGER, JOE RIGGINS, 45, known merely as SKIP, short 
               for "Skipper", a chaw of tobacco in his cheek, stands with 
               his pitching coach, LARRY HOCKETT late 30's, an ex-big leaguer 
               whose body has seen too many cocktail lounges.

               LARRY ROLLS SOME RED MAN CHEWING TOBACCO into a slab of pink 
               bubble gum, carefully folding the corners, tucking it neatly 
               together. Larry examines it as they talk -- And shoves the 
               giant chaw into his mouth.


                         Where's Ebby?


                         Ain't he warning up?


                              
                         No. The guy's professional debut and 
                         he forgets about it.


                         Better find our bonus baby, eh?

               A PLAYER, DEKE, 25, stuffs a hot dog into his mouth.


                         Seen Ebby?


                              
                         Nope.

               SKIP WHIRLS AND HEADS UP THE TUNNEL into the:





               SKIP enters, shouting --


                         Ebby?!

               CLOSE ON A BARE ASS -- Baseball uniform around the ankles, 
               short t-shirt on top, and on top of that the head of EBBY 
               CALVIN LALOOSH, baseball cap on backwards. EBBY is a great 
               looking energetic man-child with the endless confidence, 
               naivete and horniness of youth.

               Life is a party.

               A YOUNG WOMAN, MILLIE, 20, half nude, is dressing quickly.

               EBBY WHIRLS as Skip enters.


                         Jesus. Game starts in four minutes!
                              
                         Why ain't you warm?!


                         I am warm.


                         I'm fining you a hundred dollars. 
                         Jesus, Ebby, this is your professional 
                         debut tonight -- you know how many 
                         guys out there'd give blood to be in 
                         your shoes an' you're leavin' your 
                         fastball in the locker room for some 
                         piece of ass!

               MILLIE LOOKS OUT FROM BEHIND A BAT RACK -- Outraged.


                         Skip, It's me! I'm not some quote 
                         piece of ass unquote.


                         Oh, Millie, jeez, sorry -- I didn't 
                         recognize ya. Don't take it personal 
                         but if I catch you in here again 
                         you're banned from the ballpark.


                         You can't ban me from the ballpark 
                         'cause Daddy donated the scoreboard 
                         and if you banned me he might take 
                         the scoreboard away.


                         Whatta we need a scoreboard for? We 
                         haven't scored any runs all year
                              
                         Get your ass out there.

               As Skip starts to leave.


                         Hey Boss, I got a question.


                              
                         What?!


                         You think I need a nickname? I think 
                         I need a nickname. The great ones 
                         have nicknames -- somethin' like Oil 
                         Can or Catfish...

               Skip stares at him. He can't believe this guy.


                         Ya got three minutes.

               SKIP WHIRLS AND HEADS BACK OUT TO THE FIELD -- And Ebby 
               unperturbed, turns his attention back to Millie.


                         Got time for another quickie?


                         Jesus, you got a game to pitch!


                         But we got three minutes.





               MAX PATKIN STILL FLAILING AWAY to "Rock Around the Clock".


                         When the clock strikes two, three, 
                         and four and the band slows down 
                         we'll yell for more, gonna rock around 
                         the clock tonight.

               ANNIE LOOKS THROUGH HER BINOCULARS -- Studying the players 
               warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his 
               act.




                         Number twenty-two's thighs are just 
                         great. Who's he?


                              
                         Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg 
                         last year.


                         Three-fourteen? Hmmm...  Look't those 
                         thighs, Jackson.

               BACK TO MAX PATKIN -- He finishes his routine.


                         Gonna rock, gonna rock around the 
                         clock tonight.





               A WOMAN ANNOUNCER, MARYLOU, 30, speaks into the P.A. mike.


                         Let's hear it for Max Patkin --

               Applause as Patkin takes his bows, leaves the field, shakes 
               hands with a the BULL MASCOT LEADING THE APPLAUSE.


                         "The Greatest Show on Dirt" -- your 
                         own Durham Bulls!





               CLOSE ON ANOTHER PLAYER -- MICKEY MCFEE, 23, black. Smoking 
               a cigarette -- always smoking a cigarette. He snuffs out his 
               cigarette and RUNS onto the field with the rest of the team, 
               as --

               EBBY ENTERS THE DUGOUT from the runway. Larry and Skip 
               encourage their players running onto the field. Ebby is trying 
               to get the zipper on his fly unstuck. He smiles broadly at 
               Skip and Larry, and grabs his glove.


                         I'm there, Skip, I'm ready.





               THE RADIO ANNOUNCER, TEDDY CULLINANE, 50, leans into the 
               radio mike of a very small local station. Next to him is the 
               local SPORTSWRITER, WHITEY SHERRARD, 40. Between them they've 
               seen a million minor league players come and go.


                         Is this guy LaLoosh worth a hundred 
                         grand? I hear he's a quart low?


                              
                         He's left handed. Whattya expect?
                              
                         The Bulls are off to a slow start 
                         having dropped their first three 
                         games, but hope to turn it around 
                         tonight with the professional debut 
                         of the heralded young left hander, 
                         Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

               ANGLE TO ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- Millie has joined Annie and 
               Jackson. Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for 
               wisdom and insight.


                         -- Millie, you've got to stay out of 
                         the clubhouse. It'll just get 
                         everybody in trouble.


                         I got lured.


                         You didn't get "lured". Women never 
                         get lured. They're too strong and 
                         powerful for that. Now say it -- "I 
                         didn't get lured and I will take 
                         responsibility for my actions".


                         "I didn't get lured and I will take 
                         responsibility for my actions".


                         That's better.
                              
                         Got the radar ready?


                         Ready.

               JACKSON AIMS A RADAR GUN at the plate.

               THE PENINSULA WHITE SOX LEADOFF HITTER steps in.


                         The word on LaLoosh is that the good 
                         looking young lefty has a major league 
                         fastball but sometimes has problems 
                         with his control.

               EBBY CALVIN LALOOSH WINDS UP and fires. The pitch sails over 
               the batter's head, over the catcher's head, over the backstop, 
               and CRASHES INTO THE PRESS BOX.





               THE ANNOUNCER AND SPORTSWRITER CRASH to the floor as the 
               ball smashes into their booth.





               SKIP SPITS TOBACCO, mumbles flatly to Larry.


                         Little high.


                              
                         C'mon big 'un, you're okay...

               ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- She turns to Jackson.


                         Ninety-five miles an hour.


                         He looks great, just great!





               THE CATCHER TALKS TO EBBY, trying to calm him down.


                         What the hell was that?! Lighten up 
                         a little. Awright?


                              
                         Hey -- what's your name again -- I'm 
                         bad with names --


                         Ed. You want me to write it on my 
                         chest? Jesus ...


                         Sorry. Hey, Ed, I got a question.


                         What?


                         Who's the beef sitting behind the 
                         third base dugout?


                              
                         That's Annie Savoy. Nice eh? But 
                         that's more woman than you ever 
                         dreamed of, Rook. She could kick 
                         your ass and have you for breakfast.

               THE CATCHER RETURNS to the plate.





               WHITEY AND TEDDY WARILY CLIMB back to their seats.


                         One ball and no strikes to Willie 
                         Foster...



               EBBY'S NEXT PITCH HITS FOSTER in the ribs. He crumples.



               ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- She's writing a note. She hands it to 
               Jackson.


                         Take this to Ebby in the dugout 
                         between innings.


                         What's it say?


                         It says he's not bending his back on 
                         his follow-through.

               JACKSON RUNS OFF with the note. Annie turns to Millie.


                         Well let's get down to it, honey -- 
                         how was he?


                         Well, he fucks like he pitches.  
                         Sorta all over the place



               Hit "Rock Around the Clock" --



               QUICK MONTAGE OF EBBY'S FIRST GAME -- Strikeouts and wild 
               pitches. A young, gifted, uncontrollable thrower.


                         When the chimes ring five, six and 
                         seven -- We'll be right in Seventh 
                         Heaven, Gonna rock around the clock 
                         tonight...

               EBBY UNLEASHES A WILD ONE -- And decks the Bull Mascot.

               EBBY IN THE DUGOUT READS THE NOTE from Annie.

               EBBY STRIKES OUT a Peninsula batter.

               EBBY UNLEASHES ANOTHER WILD ONE and a batter hits the dirt.

               End "Rock Around the Clock" and --





               SKIP WALKS THROUGH THE PLAYERS ROOM -- Players are up, joking 
               irreverently.


                         Hey Lefty, hold 'em to 12 runs every 
                         night, you'll win 20 --


                              
                         Had 'em all the way.

               A DURHAM PLAYER SITTING HALF DRESSED in front of his locker.  
               A PICTURE OF JESUS hangs amidst his gear. The player, JIMMY, 
               25, has a Bible and prays softly to himself.


                         Dear Lord, thank you for being with 
                         us tonight, thank you for protecting 
                         us from injury and --

               DEKE WALKS BY, shaking Jimmy irreverently as he prays.


                         Wake up, wake up --

               MICKEY  COMPLAINS TO TONY as they undress.


                         This league is racist, man.


                         Every time you go 0 for 4 you think 
                         the league is racist -- face it, 
                         Mick, you're an equal opportunity 
                         "out".



               THE MANAGER'S OFFICE -- A tiny cubicle, a desk, phone Larry 
               joins him with the pitching charts. Skip studies the charts.


                         He walked eighteen?!


                         It's a league record.


                         Struck out eighteen...


                         League record.
                              
                         And he hit the Radio Announcer, a 
                         Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot 
                         twice -- also league records --
                              
                         Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.

               THE DOOR OPENS -- A PLAYER ENTERS, in street clothes, carrying 
               his suitcases. CRASH DAVIS, 30, older than the other players.  
               And different. More than just opinions, he actually has a 
               point of view. A career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever 
               he can get a job. Unlike Ebby -- Crash knows a lot about the 
               world without baseball. Also unlike Ebby -- he loves baseball 
               desperately.


                         Who're you?

               Crash speaks slowly, with a trace of cynicism and pride, 
               like an old warrior who knows he's just a hired gun.


                         I am the player to be named later.

               Beat. Skip looks out, half dressed, from his cubicle.


                         Crash Davis?


                         The Crash Davis.
                              
                         And you, Larry Hockett, should 
                         recognize me 'cause five years ago 
                         in the Texas League when you were 
                         pitching for El Paso and I was hitting 
                         cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a 
                         curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game 
                         in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed 
                         it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat 
                         you 4-3 -- and I got a free wheel 
                         alignment from Goodyear.


                              
                         Oh yeah. I shoulda throwed a slider.  
                         Damn, Crash, how're ya?


                         I'm Joe Riggins. Sit down


                         I'm too old for this shit. Why the 
                         hell am I back in "A" ball?


                         'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.

                         -- we had the gun on him tonight -- 
                         the last five pitches he threw were 
                         faster than the first five. 96 miles 
                         an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97.
                              
                         He's got the best young arm I've 
                         seen in 30 years.


                         But he ain't quite sure which plane 
                         he's on, y'know what I mean...


                         You been around, you're smart, you're 
                         professional, you know what it takes --
                              
                         We want you to mature the kid.


                         "Mature" ain't a fuckin' verb.


                         You go to college or what?


                         We want you to room with him on the

                         He can go all the way.


                         And where can I go?


                         You can keep going to the ballpark 
                         and keep gettin' paid to do it.
                              
                         Beats hell outta working at Sears.


                         Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  
                         Sold Lady Kenmores -- it's nasty, 
                         nasty work.


                         Even if it's the Carolina League -- 
                         this is a chance to play everyday.


                              
                         You don't want a player, you want a 
                         stable pony. My Triple A contract 
                         gets bought out so I can hold the 
                         Flavor o' the Month's dick in the

                         quit.

               CRASH RISES TO LEAVE -- Picks up his luggage, and turns to 
               Skip and Larry before exiting. A deep breath


                         Who we play tomorrow?

               Beat. They know, they share the inability to quit the game.  
               They're all clinging to the Church of Baseball.

               CRASH LEAVES and as he does -- Ed  enters.


                         You wanted to see me?


                         Yeah, Ed, shut the door...

               He does. Remains standing. He can see it coming.


                         This is the toughest job a manager 
                         has, Ed...
                              
                         But the organization has decided to 
                         make a change -- we're releasing you 
                         from your contract...

               CLOSE ON ED -- Silent. Motionless. Empty.





               CRASH PUTS HIS BAG IN A LOCKER as other players return from 
               the shower. Crash watches as EBBY SOAKS HIS ELBOW IN A TUB 
               OF ICE WATER as the sports writer, Whitey, interviews him.


                         How's it feel to get your first 
                         professional win?


                         It feels "out there". A major rush.  
                         I mean it doesn't just feel "out 
                         there" but it feels out there.


                         Hopeless. Utterly fucking hopeless.





               Loud country music in the players' hangout and pickup spot.  
               It's full of players and lots of young women.


               He's slick, urban, smooth.


                         Hi, I'm Millie.


                         I'm Tony. I play left field.


                         I know.

               ANNIE SITS IN THE CORNER at her own table. Max Patkin, looking 
               spiffy in a turtle neck sweater and double breasted blazer, 
               sits down next to her. Old friends.


                         Love the game, Annie, love it
                              
                         When I die I'm gonna have my ashes 
                         sprinkled around a pitcher's mound 
                         in some ballpark somewhere --
                              
                         -- and I'll have a few ashes saved 
                         for the rosin bag so I'll still be 
                         in the game after I'm gone.


                         What a sweet idea --

               A COCKTAIL WAITRESS DELIVERS another round to them.


                         We didn't order this, honey...


                              
                         He did.

                P.O.V. Crash davis sitting alone in the other corner. He 
               waves, and smiles easily.


                              
                         Who's that?


                         Hey -- that's Crash Davis. He's played 
                         in more towns than I have. Helluva 
                         guy -- real different... I actually 
                         saw him read a book without pictures 
                         once


                         Really? Kinda cute...

               ANNIE NODS AT CRASH -- He comes over to her table, greets 
               Max as an old friend, and introduces himself.


                         I'm Crash Davis.


                         Annie Savoy. Wanta dance?


                         I don't dance.


                         I don't trust a man who don't dance.  
                         It ain't natural.

               SUDDENLY -- HARD CORE ROCK AND ROLL on the juke box. Several 
               couples dance, and out of the pack --

               EBBY DANCES WITH A GROUPIE -- Spinning and whirling, 
               uninhibited and infectious. He's suddenly dancing with a 
               different WOMAN, then another, and another...

               ANNIE, CRASH AND MAX WATCH the mad performance.


                         Who's he dancing with?


                         All of 'em, I think...

               EBBY PUTS ON A ONE MAN SHOW ON THE DANCE FLOOR -- The whole 
               bar stops to watch him, applauding as he spins to a finish.  
               A quirkier "Saturday Night Fever" show. More naive, fun. He 
               climbs off the floor and joins Annie's table.


                         Thanks for the note -- you're right, 
                         I wasn't bending my back.


                         You got a live arm there.

               He extends his hand to introduce himself.


                         Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.


                         You need a nickname.


                         That's what I been telling everybody!  
                         Wanta dance?


                         She's dancing with me.


                         Crash, I didn't think you --


                         I'll learn. C'mon --


                         Just a minute, pal...

               The two men square off quickly. Annie mocks them.


                         You boys gonna fight over little me?

               CRASH RISES, pulling Annie with him. But --

               EBBY STANDS to challenge Crash.


                         Step outside, pal.


                         Love to --


                         Oh don't be such guys --

               But Crash and Ebby head outside. She turns to Max --


                         Hell, Max, wanta dance?





               A circle is formed. Everybody gathers. Millie clings to Tony, 
               her guy of the moment. Crash and Ebby face off.


                         I don't believe in fighting.


                         Pussy.


                         Take the first shot at me.


                         I ain't hitting a man first.


                         Hit me in the chest with this...

               CRASH PULLS A BASEBALL from his jacket pocket, tosses it to 
               Ebby.


                         I'd kill ya.


                         From what I hear you couldn't hit a 
                         bull in the ass with a slingshot


                         Don't try me.


                         Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.


                         No way.


                         C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause 
                         you're starting to think about it 
                         already, you're starting to think 
                         how embarrassing it'll be to miss, 
                         how all these people would laugh.
                              
                         C'mon, Rook -- show me that million 
                         dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good 
                         idea about the five cent head --

               EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away, 
               right at Crash's chest. But, alas --

               THE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance.  
               Crash never blinks.


                         Ball four.

               EBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him.


                         Who the fuck are you?!

               CRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed, 
               effortless. And brutal. BANG! Ebby goes down. And stays there 
               stunned. He looks up.


                         I'm Crash Davis. Your new catcher.  
                         And you just got Lesson Number One --
                         "Don't think -- it can only hurt the 
                         ballclub".
                              
                         Buy ya a drink?





               ANNIE AND MAX DANCE to Billy Eckstein on the juke box. Millie 
               and Tony are also on the dance floor.


                              
                         April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom, 
                         Holiday tables under the tree...

               EBBY AND CRASH WATCH FROM THE CORNER TABLE -- Ebby's right 
               eye is blackened. He holds a drink on it.


                         We fight, she gets the clown -- how's 
                         that happen?


                         Shut up -- I like this song...
                              
                         April in Paris, this is a feeling, 
                         No one can ever reprieve...


                         She's playing with my mind.


                         It's a damn easy thing to play with.

               ANNIE SUDDENLY APPEARS at the table.


                         Well -- you boys stopped fighting 
                         yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love 
                         a little macho male bonding -- I 
                         think it's sweet even if it's probably 
                         latent homosexuality being "re-
                         channeled" but I believe in "re-
                         channeling" so who cares, right?
                              
                         Shall we go to my place?


                         Which one of us?


                         Oh both of you, of course...

               CLOSE ON EBBY -- His eyes full of fear and wonder.

               CLOSE ON CRASH -- He smiles.

               THE THREE OF THEM LEAVE the bar together.





               THE SHRINE OF BASEBALL GLOWS -- Annie lights the candles.

               EBBY AND CRASH SIT ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF HER COUCH -- Both men 
               look around the room with wonder. Ebby is clearly more nervous 
               than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor 
               league career.


                         These are the ground rules.
                              
                         I hook up with one guy a season -- I 
                         mean it takes me a couple of weeks 
                         to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring 
                         training...
                              
                         And, well, you two are the most 
                         promising prospects of the season so 
                         far.
                              
                         So... I thought we should get to 
                         know each other.


                         Why do you get to choose? Why don't 
                         I get to choose?


                         Actually none of us on this planet 
                         ever really choose each other. It's 
                         all Quantum Physics and molecular 
                         attraction. There are laws we don't 
                         understand that bring us together 
                         and break us apart.


                         Is somebody gonna go to bed with 
                         somebody or what?


                         You're a regular nuclear meltdown, 
                         honey -- slow down.

               Crash rises to leave, and heads for the door.


                         After 12 years in the minor leagues, 
                         I don't tryout. Besides -- I don't 
                         believe in, Quantum Physics when it 
                         comes to matters of the heart... or 
                         loins.


                              
                         What do you believe in?

               Crash at the door. Annie's question is slightly taunting.  
               He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion:


                         I believe in the soul, the cock, the 
                         pussy, the small of a woman's back, 
                         the hanging curve ball, high fiber, 
                         good scotch, long foreplay, show 
                         tunes, and that the novels of Thomas 
                         Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated 
                         crap.
                              
                         I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald 
                         acted alone, I believe that there 
                         oughtta be a constitutional amendment 
                         outlawing astro-turf and the 
                         designated hitter, I believe in the 
                         "sweet spot", voting every election, 
                         soft core pornography, chocolate 
                         chip cookies, opening your presents 
                         on Christmas morning rather than 
                         Christmas eve, and I believe in long, 
                         slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that 
                         last for 7 days.


                              
                         Oh my...
                              
                         Don't leave...


                         G'night.

               Crash heads out into the night. Annie hurries to the-door 
               while Ebby sits on the couch, bewildered.


                         Hey -- what's all this molecule stuff?

               ANNIE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY -- Crash is on the porch.


                         Wait, Crash -- don't go -- all I 
                         want is a date. I'm not gonna fall 
                         in love with you or nothin'.


                         I'm not interested in a woman who's 
                         interested in that boy.


                         I'm not interested yet.

               Ebby appears in the door.


                         Who you calling a "boy"?


                         See ya at the yard, Meat.

               Crash walks out into the Durham night. Ebby and Annie stand 
               in the doorway. She speaks softly to Ebby.


                         No ballplayer ever said "no" to a 
                         date with me.


                         Well shit, then, let's fuck.





               ANNIE PUTS ON A RECORD -- Edith Piaf sings "Le Trois Cloches".

               EBBY STARTS UNDRESSING across the room.


                         Wait, honey, slow down -- I want to 
                         watch.

               She sits in a chair. Piaf sings. Ebby practically rips his 
               shirt off, exposing a great upper body.


                         No, no, no. Put it back on and take 
                         it off slowly.


                         Jesus, what kinda broad are you?


                         When you know how to make love, you'll 
                         know how to pitch.
                              
                         Shh. I love this part.

               Piaf sings. Annie listens. Ebby re-buttons, then unbuttons 
               his shirt. It drops, revealing his back.


                         Oh my -- what a nice back.

               Ebby drops his pants.


                         No, no, honey... first the shoes and 
                         socks.


                         The socks? It's cold in here.


                              
                         You think Dwight Gooden leaves his 
                         socks on?

               Ebby considers this. Pulls his pants back up. Takes his socks 
               off. Then his pants.


                         Ebby honey have you ever been 
                         handcuffed in bed?





               Deserted streets of the old tobacco town. Crash walks alone.  
               He picks up an old newspaper out of a trash can. He stops in 
               front of  a store window. He rolls the newspaper like a short 
               bat. He takes a batting stance, and --

               CRASH TAKES HIS BATTING STANCE in front of the window, 
               studying his reflection. He taken a "swing". And another.

               A GROUP OF OLD BLACK MEN stand in a doorway, watching.





               CLICK -- A handcuff is locked onto Ebby's wrist. Both his 
               arms are outstretched -- he's getting very excited.


                         Awright! I read about stuff like 
                         this. Bring it on!

               Annie calmly drags a chair over and sits down.


                         Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt 
                         Whitman?


                         Who's he play for?


                         Well, he sort of pitches for the 
                         Cosmic All-Stars.


                         Never heard of 'em.

               Annie opens a book and begins reading as Piaf sings softly.


                         Good -- then listen.
                              
                         "I sing the body electric. The armies 
                         of those I love engirth me and I 
                         engirth them -- "


                         We gonna fuck or what?


                         Shh, shh...
                              
                         "They will not let me off till I go 
                         with them, respond to them, and 
                         discorrupt them and charge them"






                         "Limitless limpid jets of love hot 
                         and enormous -- quivering jelly of 
                         love, white blow and delirious juice --

               CLOSE ON EBBY'S FACE -- Intrigued, aroused, frightened.





               THE OLD BLACK MAN is tossing wadded up balls of paper at 
               Crash who takes beautiful, fluid swings with the rolled up 
               newspaper. Batting practice.

               CLOSE ON CRASH'S EYES -- Studying the "pitches" with intense 
               concentration, endlessly working on his game.





               LARRY, DEKE, MICKEY AND BOBBY ARE SINGING at home plate as a 
               pre-game show. Larry is Diana Ross, the other three are the 
               Supremes, and the routine is brilliantly tacky.


                         Baby love, oh oh, baby love, I need 
                         ya oh how I need ya, All ya do is 
                         treat me bad, Take my heart and leave 
                         me sad...





               JIMMY STANDS ON A BENCH trying to get the players' attention.


                         Listen up, guys, could I have your 
                         attention a minute?
                              
                         I'm going to be leading a daily chapel 
                         service at three in the afternoons 
                         here in the locker room and you're 
                         all invited to drop by and worship 
                         before batting practice.


                         Jimmy, God damn it -- loosen up and 
                         get laid.

               BOBBY, 25, smooths the creases of his uniform, preening.


                         I don't care If you think I'm square 
                         but I believe what I believe.

               All heads turn as:

               EBBY ENTERS THE LOCKER ROOM -- He looks trashed.


                         Jesus, Ebby, what truck ran over 
                         you?


                              
                         Call me "Nuke". Annie said it's my 
                         new nickname.

               Lots of teasing from around the clubhouse.


                         Annie nailed you? That's great, means 
                         you're gonna have a helluva year. 
                         Does she fuck as good as they say?


                         We didn't do it, man -- she read 
                         poetry to me all night, I swear. 
                         It's more tiring than fucking.

               EBBY GOES TO HIS LOCKER and starts undressing. Crash sits 
               next to him, looking straight ahead. Bobby nearby.


                         -- of love"... hey, Crash, does that 
                         mean what I think it means? What's 
                         the deal here?

               Crash studies Ebby.


                         Your shower shoes have fungus on 
                         'em. You'll never get to the Bigs 
                         with fungus on your shower shoes.
                              
                         Think classy and you'll be classy. 
                         If you win 20 in the Show you can 
                         let the fungus grow back on your 
                         shower shoes and the press'll think 
                         you're colorful.
                              
                         Until you win twenty in the Show, 
                         however, it means you're a slob.

               CRASH RISES AND HEADS OUT to the field. Ebby sits silently, 
               holding his shower shoes, taking it all in.





               IN THE DUGOUT -- THE GAME FROM A DUGOUT P.O.V. The players 
               sit, stand, stir restlessly. A combination of relaxation and 
               intensity not visible from the stands.

               CRASH IS HANDED HIS BAT and helmet by the bat boy.


                         This guy's bringing some serious 
                         smoke out there.

               DUGOUT P.O.V. THE WINSTON-SALEM PITCHER throwing hard.


                         He ain't got shit.

               FOLLOW CRASH INTO THE ON-DECK CIRCLE -- The ritual. The bat 
               boy hands him the pine tar rag and he rubs pine tar on the 
               bat with great care.

               CRASH RISES -- Heads to the plate. Talking to himself.


                         You ain't getting that cheese by me, 
                         meat.

               CRASH TAKES HIS STANCE -- Upright. Calm. Head still.


                         Look for the fastball up. He's gotta 
                         come with the cheese. Relax. Relax. 
                         Quick bat. Pop the clubhead. Open 
                         the hips. Relax. You're thinking too 
                         much. Get outta your fuckin' head, 
                         Crash.

               CLOSE ON CRASH'S FACE -- His eyes intensely focused.

               CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER -- Starts his windup.


                         Get on top of the ball. Quick bat.  
                         Don't let him in your kitchen --

               THE PITCHER DELIVERS -- Crash strides. Curveball.

               Crash swings and misses, offstride. Strike one.

               CRASH QUICKLY STEPS OUT OF THE BOX and picks up dirt. Rubs 
               it on his hands. He's pissed.


                         You stupid fuck, Crash. What're you 
                         swinging at a breaking ball for? 
                         Why's he starting me off with a 
                         hammer? Fuck me.
                              
                         You're okay. Stay back. Stay back, 
                         you dumb fuck. Wait. Wait.



               CRASH STRIDES INTO THE PITCH -- Lashes a line drive down the 
               first base line. Just foul.

               Crash has started to first. Pulls up. Returns slowly to the 
               plate. Picks up his bat.


                         Throw that shit again, meat. Throw 
                         that weak ass shit.
                              
                         Now he's gotta try to slip the cheese 
                         by me. One and one. You're on top. 
                         Now bring me the gas --

                P.O.V.  PITCHER'S THIRD DELIVERY -- High and tight. Right 
               at Crash's head. The ball seems to accelerate. About to 
               explode his skull. For a moment -- THE FEAR OF DEATH...

               CRASH HITS THE DIRT -- It just misses his head.

               CRASH CLIMBS OUT OF THE DIRT -- Brushes himself off.


                         This son of a bitch throws hard.
                              
                         Annie, Annie, Annie -- who is this 
                         Annie?
                              
                         Jesus, get outta the box you idiot, 
                         where's your head? Get the broad 
                         outta your head.

               CRASH HOLDS UP HIS HAND to the ump.


                         Time out.


                         Time out!

               CRASH STEPS OUT OF THE BOX -- Motions to the bat boy for the 
               pine tar rag. The boy brings it over. Crash re-applies it to 
               his bat.


                         Get a hit, Crash.


                         Shut up.

               CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE BOX -- Talking to himself.


                         Awright, awright. You've seen all 
                         his pitches. Two and one. Relax. 
                         Wait. Quick bat. You can hit this 
                         shit --

               CRASH IN THE BATTER'S BOX -- Digs in-again. Takes his stance.  
               Upright. Relaxed. Ready.


                         Shorten up. Bring the gas... Be quick --
                         be quick -- yeah, yeah...



               ANNIE AND JACKSON IN THE STANDS -- She's writing a note 
               quickly, and hands it to Jackson, who hurries off.



               CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT PITCH -- A major league 
               fastball. It explodes to the plate. Crash swings. And misses. 
               Strike Three.

               CRASH WALKS BACK TO THE DUGOUT -- Head high, no show of 
               emotion. Almost proud. An old Warrior, not giving an inch 
               even in defeat.

               HE RE-ENTERS THE DUGOUT -- Sits down and starts putting the 
               catcher's gear back on. Deke leans over.


                         Serious heat, eh?


                         He ain't got shit.

               THE BATBOY TAKES THE NOTE FROM JACKSON -- And hands it to 
               Crash, who refuses to accept it, being busy putting his gear 
               on.


                         From Annie.


                         Read it.


                         Dear Crash. You have a lovely swing 
                         but you're pulling your hips out too 
                         early. I'd be happy to meet you at 
                         the Batting Cage tomorrow to discuss 
                         it. Signed, Annie.


                         Well if there's one chick'd know 
                         when you're pulling your hips out 
                         early, Annie's the one.

               Crash doesn't seem too amused. He grabs the note, and the 
               pen hanging from the starting lineup card taped to the dugout 
               wall. He scrawls a quick note.



               ANNIE'S PRIVATE BOX -- She's watching the players through 
               binoculars as Jackson returns with the note.


                              (looking through the 
                              glasses)
                         What'd he say?

               Jackson looks at the note uneasily, then reads --


                         It says... "I want to -- make... 
                         love to you. Crash".

               ANNIE PUTS DOWN THE GLASSES -- Takes the note.


                         Oh my...





               ANNIE DIGS IN AT THE PLATE -- Bat in hand. Crash a few feet 
               away. Annie spits on her hands, wear batting glove, pumps 
               the bat back and forth.

               THE MECHANICAL PITCHING MACHINE DELIVERS -- Kawoosh.

               ANNIE SWINGS -- Lashes out a line drive. Crash smiles.


                         See my hips?


                         Yep.


                         I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.


                         When you're hitting you shouldn't 
                         think about anything but hitting.
                              
                         But you shouldn't think about it too 
                         much. The trick is to use your brain 
                         to not use your brain.


                         But you were pulling your hips last 
                         night.


                         So... Wanta make love?

               ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES the next pitch.


                         I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  
                         You had your chance the other night.


                         What'you see in that guy -- he's 
                         dim, pretty boy. A young, wild...


                         Young men are uncomplicated.
                              
                         And he's not "dim". He's just 
                         inexperienced. My job is to give him 
                         "life-wisdom" and help him make it 
                         to the major leagues.


                         That's my job too.

               ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another pitch.


                         Damn.


                         You're pulling your hips out.


                         But they're nice hips.
                              
                         I looked up your records -- You've 
                         hit 227 home runs in the minors.  
                         That's great!

               ANNIE FOULS ONE OFF and digs in gamely.


                         Don't tell anybody.


                         Why not? If you hit twenty homers 
                         this year you'll be the all time 
                         minor league champ! The record's...


                         247 home runs in the minors would be 
                         a dubious honor, if ya think about 
                         it.


                         Oh no, I think it'd be great! The 
                         Sporting News should know about it.


                         No. Please.

               ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another one.


                         Damn.


                         Let me.

               CRASH STEPS IN TO HIT -- He takes his familiar stance. The 
               pitch comes. Crash drills it.


                         Your place or mine?


                         Despite my love of weird metaphysics 
                         and my rejection of most Judao-
                         Christian ethics, I am, within the 
                         framework of a baseball season, 
                         monogamous.


                         Fact is you're afraid of meeting a 
                         guy like me 'cause it might be real 
                         so you sabotage it with some bullshit 
                         about commitment to a young boy you 
                         can boss around --
                              
                         Great deal. You get to write self-
                         indulgent little poems all winter 
                         about how hard it is to find a man 
                         even though you just sent him packing --
                              
                         So what do you really want? You wanta 
                         be a tragic woman figure wallowing 
                         in the bullshit of magic?
                              
                         Or do you want a guy?

               The pitching machine arm flaps. Empty. Silence.


                         Oh Crash... you do make speeches...

               Crash puts the bat down, heads out the gate. She follows.

               A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ARRIVES -- Twenty-five 10 year olds in 
               uniform with a couple PARENT COACHES.


                         Hey, are you Crash Davis! Can I have 
                         a autograph?!

               CRASH STOPS TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS amidst 25 Little Leaguers.


                              
                         Well, Annie, your place or mine?


                         You got me all confused.


                         A batter has two tenths of a second 
                         to decide whether to swing --


                         I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman.


                         Hey, when are you guys gonna start 
                         winning? You're terrible!


                         It's a long season, boys.

               SUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche.


                         Hey!
                              
                         What're you guys doing here -- 
                         stealing my girl?


                         Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like 
                         that?
                              
                         Hey kids, this is the great Ebby 
                         Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.


                         It's Nuke, it's Nuke! Can I have 
                         your autograph?! Etc.


                         No prob, kids --

               And suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers.  
               Crash smiles as he turns Annie and the kids over to Nuke.


                         See you guys at the ballpark.

               Crash leaves Annie with Nuke and 25 Little Leaguers.





               AN AGING SHELBY MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- The paint's fading, a 
               couple dings in the body, but loaded under the hood.

               CRASH PUNCHES HIS TAPE DECK -- Sam Cooke's "You Send Me".

               ANNIE BITES HER FIST watching Crash leave.





               The sounds of lovemaking in a darkened room lit only by a 
               few candles.


                         Yes, yes, yesnmmmmyes...
                              
                         Oh my...
                              
                         Oh, that was just fabulous, Crash.

               Several beats of silence.


                         Crash?

               He flips on a lamp near the bed.


                         You mean Nuke. You said "Crash".


                         I didn't say "Crash". I said Nuke.


                         You said "Crash".


                         Honey, don't ever listen to a woman 
                         when she's making love. They'll say 
                         the strangest things.


                         You said "Crash".


                         Would you rather me be making love 
                         to him, using your name, or making 
                         love to you, using his name?

               Nuke considers this fabulous logic.


                         Yeah maybe you're right.


                         You see how nice things are when we 
                         go slow?

               Nuke sighs; and lets his head sink in the pillow.


                         Mmm, hmmm.
                              
                         You shoulda seen how many people 
                         came to the airport to see me off.  
                         When I got drafted first it was the 
                         happiest day of my Father's life.
                              
                         He likes baseball more than I do...


                         You can learn to like it.


                         I wanted to be the host of Dance 
                         Fever, somethin' like that...


                         Y'know if you make it to the Bigs 
                         you could still become the host of 
                         Dance Fever. Baseball's a good 
                         stepping stone for things like that.


                         God, I never thought of that.


                              
                         There is a lot of things you never 
                         thought of, sweetie -- now get some 
                         rest for tonight's game.

               Nuke rests his head on Annie's shoulder. His eyes are wide 
               open and full of nervous energy.





               NUKE ON A PAY PHONE -- In his uniform. Players warming up in 
               the background as the ground crew prepares the field.


                         Hello? Dad? This is Ebby.
                              
                         Yeah, I know, I know -- you got the 
                         Durham papers yet? Well I been a 
                         little wild...
                              
                         These hitters down here are better 
                         than the ones in high school...
                              (trying to change 
                              subject)
                         How's Mom? Yeah? Well I am trying 
                         hard... I am bending my back... you're 
                         not coming down' here to visit just 
                         yet, are you?
                              
                         Can I talk to Mom?





               THE MAYOR OF DURHAM AND THE CITY COUNCIL stand at a mike in 
               front of home plate. 300 LITTLE LEAGUERS in uniform are lined 
               up along the foul line, restrained by a rope.


                         Ladies and gentlemen, the Mayor of 
                         Durham, the honorable Mutt Clark...

               THE MAYOR STEPS to the mike.  A classic Southern mayor.


                         Welcome to the "Atlantic Seaboard 
                         Tobacco Growers City Council Little 
                         League Cash Drop Night"!

               As the honorable Mutt Clark drones on -- we INTERCUT:





               NUKE IS WARMING UP TO PITCH -- Crash and Larry watch him 
               closely, giving advice. As Nuke delivers --.


                         Drive off your back leg. You pitch 
                         with your legs as much as your arms --


                         I thought I was --


                         Don't think.

               A MANGY DOG EATS FROM A DISH provided by the players. A couple 
               kids sit with the players.




                         Hi, I'm Millie.


                         I'm married.

               JOSE FASHIONS A SMALL CROSS OUT OF CHICKEN BONES and rubs it 
               on his bat. Bobby notices this.


                         What's that?


                         Chicken bone cross take the curse 
                         off this bat and bring me hits.


                         You a God damn witch?


                         Yes. A switch hitting witch. Very 
                         common in Puerto Rico.


                         Will that work for me?


                         If you believe in Voodoo.


                         I'm 0 for 16! Gimme some of that 
                         shit.

               BOBBY HOLDS OUT HIS BAT for Jose to rub with the cross.


                         No, that is not belief. That is 
                         desperation.


                         C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!





               BACK TO THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL -- Hair and hats blowing 
               from the chopper turbulence.


                         ...five, four, three, two, one... 
                         let 'er go! One thousand big ones!

               THE HELICOPTER DUMPS HUNDREDS OF DOLLAR BILLS above the field.

               The night sky fills with fluttering money THE ROPE IS DROPPED -- 
               THREE HUNDRED LITTLE LEAGUERS charge across the infield to 
               the falling money, scooping it up wildly, brawling, shoving, 
               clawing for the cash.

               As the money flutters down...





               CLOSE ON THE ROSIN BAG on the mound. A hand picks it up.

               Puffs of rosin "smoke". Nuke is on the mound.

               NUKE NERVOUSLY WALKS AROUND THE MOUND -- Just before the 
               first batter. He picks up the rosin bag. Digs a slot for his 
               lead foot to land. And CRASH APPROACHES, in full gear, mask 
               tipped up on his head.


                         Don't try to strike everybody out.
                              
                         Strikeouts are boring. They're 
                         Fascist. Throw some ground balls, 
                         it's more Democratic.

               CRASH TURNS AND HEADS TO THE PLATE and we hear the beginning 
               of Nuke's interior monologue.


                         What's this guy know, eh? If he's so 
                         great why's he been in the minors 
                         for ten years? And if he's so hot 
                         how come Annie wants me instead of 
                         him.

               CRASH TURNS AROUND HALF WAY TO THE PLATE and returns to the 
               mound, as if he knows everything Nuke's thinking.


                         And listen, meat. You don't know 
                         shit. If you want to get to the Show, 
                         you'll listen to me. She only wants 
                         you 'cause she can boss you around, 
                         got it?
                              (beat, complete tone 
                              change)
                         Relax, have a ball out here. This 
                         game's fun, okay? Fun, God damn it.
                              
                         And don't squeeze the ball so tight. 
                         It's an egg. Hold it like an egg.

               CRASH SMILES -- And trots back to the plate.

               NUKE'S P.O.V. The first batter steps in. Crash gives the 
               sign for the pitch.


                         Fun? What's he know about fun?
                              
                         Why's he calling for a curveball? I 
                         wanta bring heat.


                         Shake off the pitch. Throw what you 
                         wanta.

               NUKE SHAKES OFF THE PITCH -- Here comes Crash back out to 
               the mound before Nuke's thrown a pitch.


                         Why you shaking me off?


                         I wanta throw the heater to announce 
                         my presence with authority.


                         "To announce your fucking presence 
                         with authority"? This guy's a first 
                         ball fastball hitter. He's looking 
                         for heat.


                         But he ain't seen my heat --


                         Awright, meat, give him your heat.

               CRASH RETURNS ONE MORE TIME to behind the plate.

               CRASH CROSSES THE PLATE, past the hitter. He speaks to the 
               opposing leadoff batter.


                         Fastball.


                         Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm 
                         the guy driving a Porsche.

               NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS -- A fastball.

               THE LEADOFF HITTER TEES OFF on the pitch and sends a line 
               shot over the right field fence.

               CLOSE ON BILLBOARD -- "Hit Cow, Win Steak" sign, The home 
               run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump.

               The COW'S MOUTH OPENS AND MOOS.

               THE BATTER STANDS AND WATCHES the home run, admiring the 
               shot, enjoying the moment. CRASH GETS IN HIS FACE instantly -- 
               and gets very tough.


                         What're you lookin' at?! You're 
                         showing up my pitcher, bush -- get 
                         your ass in gear!

               THE BATTER TAKES OFF ON A HOME RUN TROT -- Slightly scared.

               AND CRASH HEADS TO THE MOUND where Nuke watches the Mooing 
               Cow and the circling batter with dismay. Crash smiles.


                         Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?


                         Well, I held it like an egg.


                         An' he scrambled the son of a bitch.
                              
                         Having fun yet?


                         I'm having a blast.
                              
                         God, that sucker teed off on it just 
                         like he knew I was gonna throw a 
                         fastball.


                         He did know.


                         How?


                         I told him.

               CRASH SMILES -- Drops the mask, returns behind the plate.

               NUKE SIGHS -- Takes a deep breath.


                         Don't think. Just throw. Don't think. 
                         Just throw.

               NUKE'S WINDUP AND DELIVERY -- A fastball. A powerful, clean, 
               overwhelming fastball. Strike one.


                         God, that was beautiful. What'd I 
                         do?

               NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS HIS NEXT PITCH -- A monster. An 
               Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh fastball. Twenty feet wide of the 
               plate.

               THE BULL MASCOT DIVES FOR COVER -- The ball hits the bat 
               rack. Bats go flying.



               ANNIE IN HER BOX SEAT -- Jackson with the radar gun.


                         Oh dear... easy honey...


                         Ninety-five miles an hour...



               BACK TO NUKE -- Pacing the mound. Looks in for the sign.

               NUKE PITCHES AGAIN -- The batter lines a single to left.




                         Christ, Skip and Larry are talking 
                         about me. Don't get anybody warm in 
                         the pen yet. I'm okay. I'm having 
                         fun.

               NUKE PITCHES AGAIN -- The batter lines a single to right.

               NUKE'S P.O.V. THE BULLPEN -- TWO PITCHERS start warming up.


                         Don't yank me in the first, man.

               NUKE'S P.O.V. -- THE MANAGER comes out to the mound to talk.


                         Aw, shit.

               THE MANAGER AND CRASH MEET NUKE on the mound.


                         Relax.


                         Don't pull me, Skip. I'll settle 
                         down. I'm okay!


                              
                         Relax, Nuke, Relax...
                              
                         What kinda stuff's he got?


                         I don't know. I haven't caught 
                         anything yet.


                         What're you thinking about out here, 
                         Nuke?


                         I'm trying not to think.


                         Good. But just 'cause you ain't 
                         s'posed to think don't mean you ain't 
                         s'posed to use your head.

               SKIP SLAPS NUKE ON THE ASS in a gruff, reassuring way, and 
               returns to the dugout. Leaving Nuke and Crash.


                         Have some fun, God damn it.

               CRASH SMILES -- And as he returns to the plate...



               ANNIE WATCHES IN THE STANDS with Jackson and the radar gun.


                         Here we go again, Jackson, hold on 
                         tight...

               Hit Professor Longhair rock and roll... and:



               NUKE DELIVERS -- A batter grounds out weakly.

               DURHAM AT BAT -- DUGOUT -- Crash lets Jose rub his bat with 
               a chicken bone cross. Then steps to the plate and --

               CRASH HITS A LONG HOME RUN -- And circles the bases.

               NUKE DELIVERS -- A line drive nearly undresses him. Runners 
               circle the bases.





               THE SHOWERS -- Naked bodies in the steamy room. No joking 
               around. A team on losing streak.

               SUDDENLY SKIP STEPS INTO THE SHOWER in his uniform and angrily 
               throws an armload of bats into the shower.


                         Anybody not outta the shower in ten 
                         seconds gonna get fined a hundred 
                         bucks. One, two...

               THE SHOWER EMPTIES in seconds. Players grab a seat, and:

               WHITEY THE SPORTSWRITER ENTERS as he does every night.


                         No press for five minutes, Whitey.


                         I'm doing a column on the Myth of 
                         Sisyphus as manifest in a minor league 
                         losing streak, Joe, and I thought...

               SKIP PICKS UP A CHAIR AND FIRES IT AT WHITEY -- The chair 
               crashes into a locker. Whitey hurries out.


                         If I ever need a brain transplant 
                         I'll choose a sportswriter 'cause 
                         that way I'd be getting a brain that's 
                         never been used.

               A couple snickers from the players. Skip whirls.


                         What're you laughing at?!

               Silence.

               The Durham Bulls sit and stand quietly.


                         You guys lollygag the ball around 
                         the infield, ya lollygag you're way 
                         to first, ya lollygag in an' outta

                         Larry?


                         We're eight and sixteen.


                         Eight and sixteen?! How'd we ever 
                         win eight?
                              
                         Jose, what's this sign?

               SKIP FLASHES THROUGH A SEQUENCE of signs. Hand to face, hand 
               to belt, hand brushes letters, etc.


                         That's the steal.


                         Wrong. That's the bunt. This is the 
                         steal.

               SKIP FLASHES QUICKLY ANOTHER SEQUENCE -- Hand to face, hands 
               to hands. He speaks rapidly -- a private language.


                         Face is "skin to skin". Skin starts 
                         with "S". "S" stands for steal if it 
                         follows the indicator which is hand 
                         to eye 'cause the word "indicator" 
                         starts with an "I" so I figure "eye" --
                              
                         -- would remind you of "I" for 
                         indicator to indicate that what 
                         follows is the sign. I figure wrong -- 
                         You're a buncha lollygaggers.
                              
                         This is a simple game.
                              
                         ya throw the ball, ya hit the ball, 
                         ya catch the ball.

               CLOSE ON FACES OF THE PLAYERS -- Sitting silently.





               THE SIX PLAYERS' WIVES WAIT in a cluster. Three of them have 
               SMALL CHILDREN. The children are crying.

               The long-suffering women try to calm the kids.


                         Bobby went hitless again. He's gonna 
                         be in a terrible mood... terrible.  
                         How'd Mickey do?


                         He got two hits.


                         Lucky you.



               BACK INSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM -- Skip is winding down.


                         We can't win at home -- how we gonna 
                         win on the road? We got a twelve day 
                         road trip starting tomorrow.
                              
                         Bus leaves at six in the morning.

               SKIP HEADS BACK INSIDE his little office with Larry.



               INSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- He and Larry open a couple beers.

               THE DOOR OPENS -- BOBBY ENTERS wearing only a towel.


                         You wanted to see me?


                         Yeah, Bobby, shut the door.
                              
                         This is the toughest job a manager 
                         has...
                              
                         But the organization has decided to 
                         make a change --


                         Skip, I know I'm in a slump but I 
                         hit the ball hard tonight, right at 
                         'em. A couple flares drop in, and 
                         I'm back in the groove!

               The nearly naked 25 year old man pleads helplessly -- his 
               career is over.





               THE PLAYERS EXIT -- The Groupies wait in a cluster. The wives 
               wait in another group. Bobby's wife sees Bobby.


                              
                         There's Daddy! Wave to Daddy!

               has his arm around Bobby, consoling him. The wife knows.


                         Oh God...





               THE DURHAM BULLS TEAM BUS is parked. Luggage is loaded. Sleepy 
               players arriving, escorted by wives and girlfriends.

               ANNIE BIDS NUKE GOODBYE -- Off to the side. She pulls 
               something from her handbag and hands it to Nuke. A pair of 
               WOMEN'S RED PANTIES, with lace and frills.


                         I want you to wear these on the road 
                         trip when you pitch.


                         What?


                         They'll fit snugly against your balls 
                         in such a wonderful way that you'll 
                         start seeing things differently --
                         plus they'll remind you of me which 
                         is better than thinking about those 
                         nasty hitters.


                         Jesus, Annie, I don't know --


                         You've been pitching out of the wrong 
                         side of your brain. These'll help 
                         move things to the right side.


                         Big League pitchers don't use these.


                         They did when they were in the 
                         Carolina League.

               NUKE STUFFS THE PANTIES in his pocket, bewildered. A small 
               kiss from Annie, and he hurries to the bus.





               PLAYERS THROW THEIR GEAR into their travel bags.

               A PAPER BEER CUP IS TAPED TO THE WALL -- With a sign:

               "Married men deposit wedding rings here for road trips".

               CLOSE ON THE CUP -- A ring is dropped in, and another, and...

               We begin hearing Annie's VOICE OVER:


                         A woman should never ask questions 
                         about road trips.





               THE TEAM BUS PULLS OUT -- Wives and girlfriends head back to 
               their apartments, leaving:

               ANNIE WALKING BACK ROME -- Several blocks to her house.


                         Men don't realize that women always 
                         know when they've been unfaithful.
                              
                         The fact is, upon exact moment of 
                         penetration -- the woman knows.

               AS ANNIE WALKS BACK through Durham...





               THE TEAM BUS ROLLS through the North Carolina landscape.


                         This sort of spiritual awareness can 
                         be a mixed blessing, especially if 
                         you're dating a ballplayer. I believe 
                         a woman oughta take care of her man 
                         so thoroughly that he can go on the 
                         road for a few days without having 
                         the desire to search out another 
                         pair of panties
                              
                         That is probably, however, my most 
                         ridiculous belief.
                              
                         I just hope the boys start winning 
                         soon. In some profound way I fear 
                         that a last place team is a reflection 
                         on its women...

               THE BUS ROLLS through North Carolina.





               SKIP SITS IN THE FRONT of the bus, doing a crossword puzzle.

               LARRY READS A BOOK -- "How to Make a Million Dollars in Real 
               Estate with No Money Down".

               DEKE TURNS UP HIS TAPE DECK -- George Jones sings "He Stopped 
               Loving Her Today".

               MICKEY TURNS UP HIS TAPE DECK across the aisle -- Aretha 
               Franklin sings "R-E-S-P-E-C-T".

               DEKE TURNS HIS VOLUME LOUDER -- Mickey does likewise, and 
               soon we have DUELING TAPE DECKS. C &amp; W going head to head 
               with R &amp; B. A cacophony.

               SKIP LEAPS TO HIS FEET, WHIRLS and shouts.


                         I got one word to say to you -- Shut 
                         up!

               Silence.

               And then from the back of the bus, some soft, gentle, but 
               slightly dissonant guitar chords.

               THE BACK OF THE BUS -- Nuke sits across the aisle from Crash, 
               who's re-reading Thomas Pynchon. Nuke has a guitar and is 
               struggling with some chords to "Try a Little Tenderness".  
               He butchers the chords and the words.


                              
                         Oh she may get wooly, women do get 
                         wooly, because of all the stress...


                              
                         Gimme that.

               CRASH STRONGARMS THE GUITAR from Nuke.


                         I hate people who get the words wrong.  
                         It ain't "woolly" it's "weary" and 
                         it nobody's got stress, they're 
                         wearing a dress.
                              
                         Listen.

               CRASH WHIPS THROUGH THE FIRST FEW BARS of the song.


                              
                         Oh she may be weary, Young girls do 
                         get weary, Wearing the same old 
                         dress...

               HE SHOVES THE GUITAR back at Nuke.


                         How come you don't like me?


                         'Cause you don't respect yourself, 
                         which is your problem, but you don't 
                         respect the game -- and that's my 
                         problem.
                              
                         You got a gift.


                         What do I got?


                         A gift. When you were a baby the 
                         gods reached down and turned your 
                         left arm into a thunderbolt.

               Nuke looks at his left arm rubs his shoulder curiously.


                         You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're 
                         pissing it away.


                         I ain't pissing nothing away -- I 
                         got a Porsche already. A 944 with 
                         A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.


                         You don't need a quadraphonic 
                         Blaupunkt -- you need a curve ball.
                              
                         In the Show, everybody can hit the 
                         fastball.


                         You been in the Majors?


                         Yep.

               Tony and Deke overhear this and turn around. And Crash gets 
               wistful, lyrical, and even slightly hopeful.


                         I was in the Show for 21 days, once.
                              
                         It was the greatest 21 days of my 
                         life. You never touch your luggage 
                         in the show -- somebody else handles 
                         your bags. It's great.
                              
                         The ballparks are like cathedrals, 
                         the hotels all have room service, 
                         the women have long legs and brains -- 
                         it's a smorgasbord.


                         The women are hot, eh?


                         Yeah -- and so are the pitchers. 
                         They throw ungodly breaking stuff in 
                         the Show -- exploding sliders.

               Nuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement.


                         You could be one of those guys -- 
                         but you don't give a fuck, Meat.


                         God damn it I'm sick of you calling 
                         me "Meat"! You wanta step outside!

               CRASH HOPS TO HIS FEET as the bus barrels along, grabbing 
               Nuke by the collar.


                         Yeah, let's go.

               Nuke quickly has second thoughts -- Crash can be terrifying.


                         No. Wait a minute. Calm down, Crash...

               Nuke sits back down. Calms. Reaches for a baseball sitting 
               nearby. He hands the ball to Crash.


                         Teach me how to throw a breaking 
                         ball.

               Crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly:


                         As I was saying ya hold it like an 
                         egg.

               As the bus rolls through the country:

               A LATE 60'S OLDS CONVERTIBLE ROARS PAST -- Max Patkin at the 
               wheel. He waves at the team bus and honks.

               The opening bars on the National Anthem -- "Oh Say Can You 
               See"

               And Max roars off through the rolling green-landscape...

               Hit Hank Williams music to play over:





               MAX PATKIN COACHES THIRD in his comic routine, now, for the 
               Winston-Salem team, as Durham is in the field.

               A WINSTON-SALEM BATTER lines a double off the wall.





               TEDDY THE ANNOUNCER re-creates the game for broadcast with a 
               several second delay.

               HIS ASSISTANT  has a phone 
               to her ear, and writes down each play on a piece of paper, 
               holding it up for Teddy who enhances shamelessly in his ON 
               THE AIR "play by play".

               CLOSE ON PAPER -- His assistant writes "DOUBLE TO LEFT".

               TEDDY HITS A TINY MALLET against a jar. Thunk. The sound of 
               ball hitting bat. He punches one of several tape cassettes 
               cued up. A crowd roars. An array of special effects is at 
               his fingertips.


                              
                         ...double off the wall by Higgins, 
                         and once again the Durham pitchers 
                         are unable to get the first out of 
                         the inning...



               Thunk -- The mallet again.


                              
                         Line drive to center -- a diving 
                         stab by McFee -- ohhhh!  Ball gets 
                         by his glove, another run in and the 
                         crowd loves it --

               PUNCHES A CASSETTE -- A crowd roars.





               The bus rolls through a small town.





               THE TEAM BUS PULLS IN -- Players stagger off, half asleep.


                              
                         Bulls will attempt to end a six game 
                         losing streak against the Greensboro 
                         Astros with Nuke LaLoosh on the 
                         hill...





               NUKE DRESSES FOR THE GAME -- He pulls the RED PANTIES out of 
               his bag. Looks around the clubhouse. Nobody sees them. He's 
               embarrassed anyway -- and stuffs them back.





               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- The batter swings, and:





               TEDDY AND HIS ASSISTANT -- A note is held up, "Single"--

               THUNK -- The mallet strikes.


                         
                         Base hit centerfield off LaLoosh...

               HIS ASSISTANT  SCRAWLS another quick note.

               THUNK THUNK THUNK -- A rapid sequence of the mallet striking 
               the percussive box, and:


                              
                         That closes the book on LaLoosh today, 
                         5 earned runs, 5 hits, 5 strikeouts, 
                         5 walks, 5 wild pitches...





               SKIP REMOVES NUKE FROM THE GAME and he heads for the showers.





               ANNIE SITS WITH MILLIE at the kitchen table, listening to 
               the radio. Annie sighs. Millie consoles her.





               NUKE IN THE SHOWERS ALONE -- Letting the water run over him.

               The voice of Teddy an the air, editorializing shamelessly.


                              
                         It's time to tell it like it is, 
                         sports fans -- and this is the most 
                         wretched road trip I've seen in 20 
                         years, and possibly the worst Durham 
                         team in half a century.
                              
                         Where are the great Bull players of 
                         yesteryear? Where are the Footsie 
                         Blakes, the Digger O'Dells, the Gus 
                         Palowitzes?

               TEDDY'S VOICE PLAYS OVER road trip images:

               NUKE STARTS TO PUT ON THE RED PANTIES -- Changes his mind, 
               and hides them again.

               THE TEAM BUS rolling across North Carolina.

               THE TEAM BUS at a drive through hamburger stand somewhere in 
               the Smoky Mountains.  Sack after sack of fast food is passed 
               through the window to Skip.

               THE TEAM BUS PULLS INTO YET ANOTHER HOTEL and this time, a 
               Bus with a sign -- "Holiday on Ice" pulls in next to them.


                              
                         Is the modern athlete a pale imitation 
                         of the great old warriors? Only Crash 
                         Davis stands out this year, begging 
                         the question, "What are these boys 
                         thinking about, 'cause it sure ain't 
                         baseball".





               As the players rise in the bus, Deke is trying to work up 
               excitement about the "Holiday on Ice" bus from which twenty 
               great looking women ice skaters are getting off.

               P.O.V.  HOLIDAY ON ICE GIRLS getting off the bus.


                         Ice skaters. God. Look't em. that's 
                         what we need, y'know -- one night 
                         with some skaters and we can get 
                         back on track...


                         We need a night off just to stop our 
                         losing streak. We need a rainout.


                         I can get us a rainout.


                         It's 90 degrees, there ain't been a 
                         cloud in the sky in weeks.


                         Hundred bucks says I can get us a 
                         rainout tomorrow.


                         You're on.





               A CAB PULLS UP in the dark. Late at night. The cab leaves, 
               and the four men climb over the fence.





               CRASH PULLS THE LID OFF A BOX -- Several valve handles.

               Crash turns several handles with an iron bar, and...

               THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM COMES TO LIFE -- And suddenly the field 
               is covered with the clicking of rain-bird sprinklers, throwing 
               long slow arcs of water across the entire field.






               THE FOUR PLAYERS sit on the scoreboard, watching the 
               sprinklers flood the field. A six-pack is passed around.





               A QUAGMIRE ON THE INFIELD -- The Kingston GENERAL MANAGER 
               stands in the muck with his ground crew. Wheelbarrows, 
               shovels, sand is piled around. It's hopeless.


                         God damn it! Vandals. Damn kids!


                         We can't get it ready by game time, 
                         boss.

               The General Manager studies the field. Hopeless.

               He looks up at the sky. Cloudless, sunny.


                              
                         Call the radio and the paper.
                              
                         The game's been rained out.

               Organ music -- "The Blue Danube Waltz".





               "HOLIDAY ON ICE" in its matinee performance. The beautiful, 
               leggy women skating to the "Blue Danube Waltz".

               TEN OF THE DURHAM BULLS sit in the front row. Nuke, Deke, 
               Tommy, others, but not Crash. Tony waves to a skater.

               THE SKATER WAVES BACK as she swirls past the Bulls.





               DEKE ICES THE CHAMPAGNE -- In the b.g. Tommy is blow drying 
               his hair. Mickey puts the finishing touches on his outfit. 
               Several other players get ready to party.


                         Par--ty! I blew a whole day's meal 
                         money for this champagne seven 
                         dollars, man, it better be good.


                         For seven bucks it better be some 
                         serious shit.


                         What time is it, eh? When are they 
                         coming?

               The guys lounge around nervously, trying to be casual.





               CLOSE ON A STEAK DINNER set down in front of Crash.

               Nuke hands Crash a hundred dollar bill.


                         This is from Tony for the rainout.  
                         C'mon, man, let's go to the party.


                         Naw...


                         "Naw"? There's ice skaters coming!  
                         You ever made love to an ice skater?


                         By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice 
                         Capades, Ice Follies --
                              
                         I'm through with one night stands.


                         You're through with one night stands?!  
                         What do you want?


                         I just wanta play everyday despite 
                         small nagging injuries -- and go 
                         home to a woman who appreciates how 
                         full of crap I truly am.

               Nuke just stares at him.


                         You're weird, man -- I want a ice 
                         skater real bad.


                         Go for it.


                         If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?


                         I won't have to.

               NUKE LOOKS AT HIM STRANGELY -- And hurries to the party.





               THE GUYS ARE GROOMING TO EXCESS -- Still blow drying and 
               preening for each other.

               A knock at the door.

               THEY QUICKLY GET "CASUAL" and lounge seductively.


                         It's them, it's them! Be casual.
                              
                         Come in!

               THE DOOR OPENS -- It's Nuke.


                         Hey, guys, pa--rty!


                         Shut up and be cool, man. Like Mickey 
                         there...

               MICKEY "LOUNGES" WITH A DRINK and a cigaret.


                         You wanta make it to the Show, Rock, 
                         you gotta learn how to "lounge".

               NUKE LEANS ON THE BAR with an elbow, striking his version of 
               a "lounging" pose.


                         How's this?


                         You got it.

               A knock at the door.


                         Entre.

               EIGHT ICE SKATERS STAND IN THE DOORWAY -- Ready to...


                         Pa--rty!

               POP THE CORK ON THE SEVEN DOLLAR CHAMPAGNE -- And party...





               THE WIVES AND SOME GIRLFRIENDS WATCH "DYNASTY" on Annie's 
               television. Annie hosts, filling their drink glasses, serving 
               popcorn, and largely staying in the background.


                         Do you think your husband plays around 
                         on the road trips?


                         No way. Well... God... do we have to 
                         talk about that?


                         I guess not... it's just that once I 
                         asked Mickey if he was faithful to 
                         me on the road trips and he said "in 
                         his heart he was faithful".
                              
                         What the hell does that mean?


                         It means he's unfaithful -- but only 
                         a man would put it in those words.

               A BABY CRIES -- Tommy's Wife lifts a baby from the couch, 
               begins rocking It.





               Players are dancing, drinking, hustling the ice skaters, the 
               music is up, the party swinging, when:

               SKIP ENTERS -- He's steaming and slightly drunk. Larry is 
               with him.


                         I just got one word to say to 
                         everybody -- shut up!

               THE PLAYERS AND ICE SKATERS freeze in mid-party.


                         Nuke -- get everybody in here. Hundred 
                         dollar fine anybody's not here in 
                         five.







               NUKE POUNDS ON DOORS in a hurry.

               -- P.O.V. IN FIRST DOOR -- Jimmy is on his knees at the bed, 
               bare chested, praying with an open Bible.


                         Get your holy ass in Room 401.

               He hustles to the next door, and pounds madly.

               -- P.O.V. IN SECOND DOOR -- TWO NAKED WOMEN with Jose and 
               Tony, nearly nude.


                         Hundred dollar fine if you're not in 
                         #401 in five.


                         Hundred dollars?!

               JOSE AND TONY LOOK AT THE TWO WOMEN -- It's a lot of money 
               in Class AAA ball.


                         Christ. Sorry ladies...

               JOSE AND TONY HURRY OUT in their shorts.


                         Go to hell! You're in last place 
                         anyway!

               AND NUKE HURRIES DOWN THE HALL -- Pounding on each door.





               CRASH EATING ALONE -- Peacefully. Nuke arrives excitedly.


                         Crash! Skip wants everybody in #401 
                         for a team meeting. Hundred buck 
                         fine if ya don't show!

               CRASH PULLS OUT THE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL and hands it to him.


                         Party without me.


                         God -- what a Big League move.

               NUKE TAKES THE MONEY and hurries back.





               24 PLAYERS AND 8 ICE SKATERS -- Some of the players Nuke 
               rounded up are partially dressed. Skip spots the women.


                         Who are you?


                         We're ice skaters. Can we go now?


                         No. I want you to hear my philosophy.  
                         It'll do you some good
                              
                         Here it is. This is a simple game.  
                         You throw the ball, you hit the ball, 
                         you catch the ball. You got that?!


                              
                         Yes.


                         Are you lovely creatures aware that 
                         you are about to compromise yourselves 
                         with a buncha bums who are --

                         Eight and twenty-four.


                         Eight and twenty-four! How'd we ever 
                         win 8 games?


                         It's a miracle.


                         Look, guys -- I'm a man, I got needs 
                         too.  I understand this party --

                         sex is the one thing you can get 
                         further behind in and catch up faster 
                         than anything I know.
                              
                         There's a baseball lesson in there 
                         somewhere.
                              
                         Where's Crash?

               NUKE STEPS FORWARD -- Hands Skip the hundred dollar bill..


                         He can't make it. Here's his fine.


                         Aw Christ, he don't have to come.  
                         He's hitting .350.


                         Don't you think that's a double 
                         standard -- we're here and he ain't?


                         I believe in a double standard for 
                         guys hitting .350.

                         There's only two places you can be 
                         in life -- in the Caddy or under it.
                              
                         These are the best years of your

               CLOSE ON TELEVISION -- "DYNASTY" drones on.


                              
                         Deke was a great player in high 
                         school. I thought held go right to 
                         the Major Leagues -- I was gonna be 
                         a Big League wife.

                         What?


                         What would you think of a pitcher 
                         who wore women's panties?


                         If he had a good breaking ball, I'd 
                         respect the shit outta him.

               Crash turns off the light.

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- A bit of light spill on his face. Eyes open. 
               A long ways from sleep.





               CLOSE ON NUKE'S FACE -- He takes his cap off, wipes his brow.

               He's pitching. Everything in SLO-MO.

               FANS IN THE BALLPARK LAUGH at Nuke, mocking his.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP ON NUKE'S EYES -- Frightened.

               SLOW FULLBACK ON NUKE -- HE'S STARK NAKED save for his cap 
               and glove. Everyone else is clothed.

               NUKE WINDS AND PITCHES in the nude. SLO-MO... and as the 
               batter cranks up to take a vicious swing --





               CLOSE ON NUKE'S FACE -- He awakes with a start.


                         No!

               CRASH LEANS OVER and shakes him.


                         Wake up, it's okay... you're 
                         dreaming...

               CRASH HELPS NUKE back to consciousness. Nuke shakes his head, 
               trying to wake up. Crash is almost tender.


                         I was playing naked.


                         I know, I know -- I have that dream 
                         all the time. We're almost home.

               The Bus continues across the Carolina landscape.





               The team bus pulls into a deserted parking lot. A few of the 
               players' cars are parked. Some of the wives and girlfriends. 
               And Annie.

               THE PLAYERS SHUFFLE OFF the bus. Tired and beat.

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- He looks worse than the rest. He sees Annie 
               and waves. She's waiting next to her old Volvo.





               ANNIE'S VOLVO PULLS OUT -- She drives.



               Annie is up -- Nuke is down.


                         God I'm tired. What a trip I was 
                         lousy. I was worse than lousy.  
                         Everytime I pitched -- it was like 
                         throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom.  



                         What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You 
                         only talk about yourself? Aren't you 
                         glad to see me? Don't I look nice?


                         Sorry. You look great. I'm totally 
                         exhausted.


                         Good. Total exhaustion can be 
                         spiritually fabulous.
                              
                         Let's play catch.


                         Catch?





               Flowers and birdfeeders everywhere. And, 60 feet away in 
               complete, oversized catcher's gear --

               JACKSON IN A CATCHER'S CROUCH -- Nuke stares, in his street 
               clothes, but now with a glove and ball.


                         Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in 
                         here, hum babe--


                         That's not necessary, Jackson --
                              
                         Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.

               He does. Jackson flashes some ridiculous signs.


                         This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.


                         Just do what I say. Now, which nostril 
                         are you breathing through?


                         Which nostril am I breathing through?

               Annie puts her hand under his nose.


                         The right nostril. Good.


                         My right nostril?


                         There are two important psychic 
                         conduits called the "pingala" and 
                         the "ida". The pingala starts with 
                         the left testicle (or left ovary of 
                         the female) and ends at the right 
                         nostril.

               She touches his left nut through his pants in a matter of 
               fact manner. He stares back.


                         The ida originates at the right 
                         testicle  and terminates 
                         at the left nostril.


                         I'm really beat. I need some serious 
                         "z's" --


                         The pingala is the nostril used for 
                         throwing a baseball.
                              
                         And if you discover before a game 
                         you're in the wrong nostril, it's 
                         easy to switch.


                         Switch nostrils?


                         Right. Okay, fire a couple in there.

               NUKE TOSSES AN EASY PITCH to Jackson. Annie's incensed.


                         You're patronizing me! I will not be 
                         patronized --


                         If I throw too hard I'll hurt the 
                         kid.


                         He's handled a lotta pitchers whose 
                         records were better than one and 
                         six.

               Nuke gets a little steamed. He feels his nostril, winds, and 
               fires a medium speed fastball to Jackson.


                              
                         How was that?


                         A little better.


                         Gimme the God damn ball!

               NUKE WINDS UP and fires a pitch to Jackson. Alas --

               THE BALL SAILS THROUGH A WINDOW -- Crashing glass.


                              
                         How ya like that?


                         Much better. Your delivery was fully 
                         integrated because you weren't 
                         thinking about it 'cause you were 
                         pissed off at me.
                              
                         This is progress.

               Nuke smiles and gives in. And reaches for her.


                         I give up. Let's go inside, make 
                         love, and fall asleep till it's time 
                         to go to the ballpark.

               She takes his hand and leads him up to the back porch.


                         Or...
                              
                         ...We could just take that sexual 
                         energy and save it for a few hours 
                         and re-channel it into your pitching 
                         tonight.
                              
                         C'mon, Jackson, I've got some 
                         lemonade!

               Jackson runs over in full gear to join them.

               SITTING ON THE BACK PORCH -- A pitcher of lemonade.


                         I can't keep up with you. First you 
                         say sex is gonna make me a better 
                         pitcher -- now no sex is gonna do 
                         it?!


                         It's all the same thing.

               SUDDENLY NUKE'S FACE IS FILLED WITH ALARM -- He points.


                         What's that?!

               -- P.O.V. A CARDBOARD BOX ON A TABLE NEARBY -- Scrawled in 
               larged letters on the side are the words "MAX PATKIN".


                              
                         That's Max. His ashes anyway. He 
                         left no kin...

               Nuke stares, unsettled.


                         God... I think I'm gonna be sick --


                         Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing 
                         to be scared of. It's just another 
                         way of living. It's just a fresh 
                         start -- kinda like spring training.

               Nuke thinks about this carefully. Looks at the ashes, at 
               Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head.


                         Death is like spring training?


                         Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in 
                         the eyes, Nuke --
                              
                         You haven't been wearing my panties, 
                         have you?

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- Utterly bewildered.





               NUKE PULLS HIS JOCKSTRAP ON over the red panties.

               Crash notices the panties, and snaps the waistband.


                         Hot. Very hot...

               Nuke looks around nervously, continues dressing quickly.


                         Annie says her panties will keep one 
                         side of my brain occupied while I'm 
                         on the mound, thus keeping my brain 
                         slightly off center, which is where 
                         it should be for artists and pitchers. 
                         She also said I should throw whatever 
                         pitches you call for.


                         Annie's a smart lady.

               Suddenly Deke spots Nuke's panties.


                         Hey, fruit alert! Check out the Rook.

               SEVERAL PLAYERS GATHER AROUND -- Wolf whistles aimed at Nuke 
               as the players are dressing into their uniforms.


                         Annie says there's no such thing as 
                         straight and gay. We're all sexual 
                         creatures to start with, and we get 
                         formed into certain roles.


                         You believe that?


                         When I'm one and six I'll believe 
                         anything.
                              
                         Annie also says that God is a woman.  
                         You believe that, Crash, you think 
                         God's a lady?


                         God's definitely a woman -- but she's 
                         no lady.


                         This is all Commie bullshit.
                              
                         God has a dick, man.


                         God damn it, Jimmy, you're an expert -- 
                         does God have a dick or a pussy?

               JIMMY TURNS FROM HIS CUBICLE to answer the theological 
               question.  Ll heads wait for the answer.


                         The Lord God is tri-une -- Father, 
                         Son, and Holy Ghost.


                         Father and Son. Awright!

               The guys slap fives, convinced God is a man.


                              
                         Yeah, but He is a brother.


                         Bullshit! God ain't no brother!

               Deke turns to Crash, full of despair.


                         If there is a God, why am I hitting 


               SUDDENLY SKIP AND LARRY APPEAR to restore order.


                         Shut up! This is a damn noisy 
                         clubhouse for a team that's lost 15 
                         straight.

               Silence.

               Skip takes off his cap -- instantly sincere.


                         Patkin was a tribute to baseball...


                         ...and one helluva guy.





               A BLACK GOSPEL GROUP at a mike at home plate, singing:


                              
                         I come to the garden alone, When the 
                         dew is still on the roses, And the 
                         voice I hear, whispering in my ear,.  
                         The Son of God discloses --

               ANNIE SPRINKLES MAX'S ASHES on the pitcher's mound, as:

               JACKSON SITS IN THE DUGOUT FILLING ROSIN BAGS with the extra 
               ashes from a box.





               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- "MAX" ROSIN BAG on the mound.



               NUKE ON THE MOUND -- PICKS UP the rosin bag, and paces. A 
               small crowd. A batter steps in to hit. Nuke looks in for the 
               sign.


                         God, these panties feel great. That 
                         don't make me queer, right? Right.  
                         Whoo.
                              
                         Breaking ball.

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- Breaking ball for a strike.


                         I ain't queer. I know I ain't...
                              
                         Fastball.

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- Fastball for a strike.



               ANNIE'S BOX SEAT IN THE STANDS -- She charts pitches.


                         Ninety-three miles an hour.


                         He looks wonderful, Jackson...



               NUKE ON THE MOUND -- He looks in for the sign.


                         Fastball again? Why's he want the 
                         heat -- I just threw heat. Don't 
                         think, Meat -- give 'em the gas.

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- An eye-popping fastball. The batter 
               swings and misses. Strike three.



               IN THE DUGOUT -- SKIP AND LARRY LOOK AT EACH other warily.


                         Jesus -- what's got into Nuke?


                         I heard he's wearing women's underwear -- 
                         and he's breathing through his pingala 
                         nostril.


                              
                         I'm getting too old for this game.

                P.O.V. NUKES FASTBALL SHATTERS A BAT -- THE HITTER hits a 
               weak roller to third for the second out.



               BACK TO THE MOUND -- Nuke is pumped up. Paces.


                         God, Annie's got a great ass... How 
                         come her panties fit me? That's one 
                         of the mysteries of sex I guess...

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS A VICIOUS CURVEBALL -- A check swing 
               dribbler to first for the third out. And the players run 
               into the dugout.





               NUKE PUTS ON HIS WARM UP JACKET and sits down next to Crash, 
               who's taking off his gear, readying to hit.


                         I was great, eh?


                         Your fastball was up and your 
                         curveball was hanging -- in the Show 
                         they woulda ripped you.


                         Can't you let me enjoy the moment?


                         The moment's over.
                              
                         If this guy starts me off with a 
                         breaking ball, I'm going downtown --

               CRASH SMILES in his disarming way, and grabs a bat.





               Crash kneels, rubbing the bat handle with pine tar. He studies 
               the pitcher working the first two hitters.

               CRASH RISES and heads to the plate.

               CRASH STEPS INTO THE BOX -- Digs in.


                         I dare you to throw me the hammer -- 
                         you ain't that stupid...

               CRASH'S P.O.V. IN SLOW-MOTION -- The pitcher winds and 
               delivers. And as the ball leaves the pitcher's hand--


                         Breaking ball -- you fool!

               CRASH UNLOADS ON THE PITCH -- Crushing a home run deep over 
               the left field wall.





               TEDDY THE RADIO ANNOUNCER is wary about these events.


                         Two-nothing Bulls in the second -- 
                         first time the Bulls have been ahead 
                         in weeks, eh Whitey --
                              
                         Let's see if the real Nuke LaLoosh 
                         will show up --



               NUKE FIRES THREE QUICK PITCHES for another strike out. Curve 
               ball, fast ball, curve ball. Overpowering.



               ANNIE AND JACKSON in her box seat.


                         Oh my...



               SKIP AND LARRY IN THE DUGOUT -- Skip looks at Larry as if to 
               say "What's happening?" Larry just shrugs.



               BACK TO THE FIELD -- Nuke's next pitch.

               THE NEXT BATTER POPS UP -- Crash circles into foul ground to 
               make the catch, whipping the ball around the infield.

               AND CRASH GOES TO THE MOUND for a visit.


                         Hey, I'm cruisin', man -- what're 
                         you doing out here?!


                         I want you to throw this one at the 
                         bat rack.


                         Why?! I'm finally throwin' the damn 
                         thing where I want to.


                         It'll keep the fear of God in the 
                         hitters. Trust me.


                         You're the boss.

               CRASH RETURNS TO THE PLATE -- Flashes a sign.



               THE PRESS BOX Teddy's getting worked up.


                         -- a staggering start by LaLoosh -- 
                         he's thrown 5 cuts on 9 pitches, all 
                         of them strikes -- he's got pin point 
                         control here tonight, Bull fans... 
                         here's the pitch --



               NUKE'S NEXT DELIVERY -- A wild ass rocket thirty feet off 
               line. The BULL MASCOT DIVES for cover.

               THE BATTER STEPS OUT OF THE BOX nervously, muttering.


                         This guy's crazy.


                         Yep. Next one might be at your head. 
                         Hell if I know where the damn thing's 
                         going...

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- Smiles. Winds. Delivers. A change up.

               THE BATTER SWINGS TERRIBLY OFF STRIDE -- Strike three. Crash 
               whips the ball around the infield.






                         -- top of the ninth, two outs, one 
                         out away from a stunning two hit 
                         shutout for LaLoosh...



               NUKE ON THE MOUND -- Bearing down.


                         Bear down, Meat, don't let up. You 
                         own these guys. Dad'll love a 
                         shutout...

                P.O.V. CRASH FLASHES THE SIGN -- Nuke doesn't like it.




                         No, no -- this guy's looking for 
                         heat -- lemme give him the deuce --

               NUKE SHAKES OFF THE SIGN Cocky, full of himself.



               ANNIE AND JACKSON in her box seat.


                         Oh no -- he's shaking off the sign, 
                         Jackson. Big mistake...


                         He'll learn.






                         This son of a bitch is throwing a 
                         two hit shutout and he's shaking me 
                         off?!
                              
                         Hey Charlie, here comes the deuce.

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- A hanging curveball. The batter 
               takes an ungodly cut, and BLASTS a long home.

               THE BATTER STANDS AT THE PLATE watching the blast... until 
               CRASH SHOVES HIM toward first with a sneer. For a moment it 
               looks like there'll be a fight -- but the hitter backs off 
               and takes the home run trot as:

               NUKE STARES AT THE OUTFIELD WALL as the batter circles the 
               bases. Crash walks to the mound.


                         You told him I was throwing a deuce, 
                         right?


                         Yep. He really crushed that dinger, 
                         didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet... 
                         damn...

               NUKE HOLDS OUT HIS GLOVE -- Says nothing. Crash puts a new 
               ball in the glove. Returns to the plate.

               NUKE GETS THE SIGN -- Winds. Delivers. Batter hits a weak 
               one hopper back to the mound. Game's over.





               A raucous celebration of the victory. Booze flows.

               And we begin hearing the familiar sounds of Piaf...





               ANNIE COMES OUT OF THE BATHROOM -- Dressed in a long, flowing 
               nightgown, elegant and old fashioned. She looks fabulous, 
               PRESENTING HERSELF to Nuke.


                         I'm yours.


                         Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it 
                         works for one game, maybe it'll work 
                         for a whole buncha games.


                         Breathing through your pingala always 
                         works, honey --


                         Not that. I mean the re-channeling 
                         of my sexual energy.
                              
                         Maybe we shouldn't make love for 
                         awhile.


                         Now don't go overboard, I look 
                         incredibly hot, right?

               She strikes a pose. She does look hot.


                         You know what it feels like to throw 
                         a three hitter?
                              (nervously, with 
                              resolve)
                         We better not fuck.


                         Nuke?!


                         Just till I lose.


                         Get over here.


                         No.


                         Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh --

               She starts toward him -- and Nuke flees. Out the door, into 
               the night. Annie slumps in disbelief.





               ANNIE SITS IN BED ALONE -- Lights a cigarette. A puzzled 
               expression -- things have got out of control.


                         Nuke was so encouraged that he took 
                         a vow to not have sex until they 
                         lost...

               Annie reaches over, opens a drawer in her nightstand, and 
               pulls out her baseball glove. She cradles it fondly in her 
               lap, puts it on, pounds it gently...


                         Y'see a ballplayer on a streak 
                         considers himself touched with magic 
                         and he'll do anything to keep from 
                         breaking the spell...





               NUKE NEATLY UNFOLDS THE RED PANTIES in his locker.


                         In fact the whole team started making 
                         religious connections and everybody 
                         got hot.

               JOSE BLESSES THE BATS with a chicken bone cross.

               JIMMY READS THE BIBLE and prays alone in the corner.





               PLAYERS TAKING GROUND BALLS and batting practice.


                         I figured Nuke would win a couple, 
                         then lose, and things would get back 
                         to normal...

               PLAYERS PLAYING "FLIP" PEPPER like kids.


                         But it didn't happen like that... 
                         and for one extraordinary June and 
                         July, the Durham Bulls, for whatever 
                         perverse reason, began playing 
                         baseball with joy and verve and poetry --

               NUKE WARMING UP in the bullpen, listening to Crash.


                         The two sides of my own brain were 
                         all jumbled up and cross-wired...  
                         while one side was being neglected, 
                         the other was in paradise watching 
                         our Bulls play like Big Leaguers...

               MICKEY RIPS A TRIPLE UP THE ALLEY -- Slides into third.




                         We swept a four game series with 
                         Kingston, back to back doubleheaders 
                         with Winston-Salem, and kicked the 
                         holy shit out of Greensboro in a 
                         three game series...

               SEVERAL PLAYERS SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS at a local mall. A line 
               of kids to meet them. A banner -- MEET YOUR BULLS!


                         They were in demand all over town -- 
                         and Crash, who kept hitting dingers, 
                         was approaching the minor league 
                         record... though I told nobody.

               CRASH BLASTS ANOTHER HOME RUN -- Another win.

               JULY 4 PROMOTION -- LARRY, DEKE, TOMMY, AND JOSE dressed as 
               the "Spirit of 176 Drum and Fife Corps" at home plate, 
               surrounded by a Boy Scout Troop.


                         After sweeping a July 4 doubleheader, 
                         the Durham Bulls were tied for first.

               THE WIVES, THE GROUPIES, AND MILLIE WAIT for the players 
               outside the clubhouse following a game.

               ANNIE SITS ALONE IN HER BOX SEAT as the stadium empties.


                         But beautiful as the winning streak 
                         was, I was getting damn lonely.
                              
                         Something had to be done. I needed a 
                         man...





               The sounds of Diana Ross and the Supremes.



               LARRY, DEKE, TOMMY AND MICKEY as the Supremes, singing "Stop 
               in the Name of Love" at the front of the bus.


                         I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  
                         I love it. Teach me everything.


                         It's time you started working on 
                         your interviews.


                         What do I gotta do?


                         Learn your clichs. Study them. Know 
                         them. They're your friends.

               Crash hands Nuke a small pad and pen.


                         Write this down.
                              
                         "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."


                         Boring.


                         Of course. That's the point.
                              
                         "I'm just happy to be here and hope 
                         I can help the ballclub."


                         Jesus.


                         Write, write -- "I just wanta give 
                         It my best shot and, Good Lord 
                         willing, things'll work out."

               NUKE STARTS WRITING them down.


                         "...Good Lord willing, things'll 
                         work out."


                         Yep. So how's Annie?

               Nuke looks up from his clichs, startled.


                         She's getting steamed 'cause I'm 
                         still re-channeling my sexual energy -- 
                         maybe I should cave in and sleep 
                         with her once just to calm her down.  
                         What'ya think?


                         You outta your mind? If you give in 
                         now you might start losing.
                              
                         Never fuck with a winning streak.

               Nuke nods seriously, listening to the master.





               THE BUS PULLS IN -- Wives and girlfriends are waiting.

               The players get off, greet their women.

               ANNIE GREETS NUKE -- They head for her Volvo..

               JIMMY STARTS ACROSS THE LOT on foot, dragging his luggage, 
               when Millie pulls up in her car.


                         Hi, Jimmy. Want a ride?


                              
                         Have you accepted Jesus Christ as 
                         your personal savior?


                         No.


                         Can I give you my testimony?


                         You can do anything you want.
                              
                         Hop in.

               JIMMY NERVOUSLY GETS IN WITH MILLIE They roar away.





               NUKE SITS AT THE TABLE -- He's just finished eating.

               Annie circles him. A pot of soup on the stove.


                         I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  
                         Want some more soup?


                         No, no, it was great.


                         How 'bout a back rub?


                         No, that's okay. All I need's a little 
                         nap.


                         I'll tuck you in.


                              
                         You can't seduce me.


                         I'm not gonna try to seduce you, 
                         sweetie...

               ANNIE STRETCHES OUT HER LEG and lays it an the table.


                         What's that?

               She pulls back her skirt slightly, exposing her garter snaps 
               attached to her stockings.


                         That's my leg.


                         I know what it is.


                         I figure we could work on some 
                         fundamentals even if we don't make 
                         love.

               She strokes her leg. Nuke stares fearfully.


                         Fundamentals?


                         Sure.
                              
                         Unsnap my stockings.

               Nuke squirms, then reaches for her garter snaps. And stops.


                         Crash once called a woman's, uh -- 
                         pussy -- y'know how the hair kinda 
                         makes a "V" shape? --


                         Yes I do...


                         Well -- he calls it the Bermuda 
                         Triangle. He said a man can get lost 
                         in there and never be heard from 
                         again.


                         What a nasty thing to say.


                         He didn't mean it nasty. He said 
                         that gettin' lost and disappearing 
                         from the face of the earth was 
                         sometimes a good thing to do -- 
                         especially like that.


                         Oh...
                              
                         Crash is a very smart man. Now c'mon, 
                         honey, give it a try.

               NUKE REACHES FOR THE GARTER SNAPS with two hands. He fumbles, 
               groping awkwardly. Annie stops him gently.


                         Watch... one hand --

               WITH A SINGLE HAND ANNIE FLICKS each snap. Flick, flick, 
               flick. Magic. The snaps open effortlessly.


                         oh.

               ANNIE RE-SNAPS THEM QUICKLY, offering her leg to Nuke.


                         Now you try.

               NUKE TRIES AGAIN -- One handed. Awkwardly again, but --


                              
                         Mmmmmmm... oh yes...

               BUT NUKE LEAPS TO HIS FEET -- Reacting vigorously, nervously, 
               desperately. The soup crashes on the floor.


                         No! You're playing with my mind!


                         I'm trying to play with your body!


                         I knew it -- you're seducing me!


                         Of course I'm seducing you for 
                         Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor 
                         job of it --
                              
                         Aren't I pretty?


                         I think you're real cute.


                         Cute?! I hate cute! Baby ducks are 
                         cute! I wanta be exotic and 
                         mysterious!


                         You're exotic and mysterious and 
                         cute -- that's why I better leave.

               Nuke starts to leave.


                         Nuke! You got things all wrong! 
                         There's no relation between sex and 
                         baseball. Ask Crash.


                         I did.


                         What'd he say?


                         He said if I gave in to you I'd start 
                         losing again.


                         He did?


                         I'll be back when we lose.

               NUKE HURRIES OUT THE DOOR -- Annie just stares.





               A run of the mill cheap modern motel.



               CRASH WORKS ON HIS SWING in front of a mirror.

               A knock at the door.


                         Come in.

               ANNIE ENTERS the room. Crash stays with his stance.


                         Crash... I want you.


                         Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?


                         He's confused --


                         Aren't we all?


                         Don't you think I'm pretty?

               Crash puts down the bat, and looks directly at her. As he 
               does he picks up two spring loaded hand exercisers and begins 
               pumping them an he talks.


                         You're gorgeous, God damn it! From 
                         the moment I first saw you I knew I 
                         had to have you. I had to have you!


                         I want to be had.


                         I think of you and the "boy" all the 
                         time.


                         He won't make love to me anymore.


                         And he's right! A ballplayer on a 
                         streak has to respect the streak. 
                         They don't happen very often.
                              
                         You know how hard this game is? If 
                         you believe you're playing well 
                         because you're getting laid or because 
                         you're not getting laid or because 
                         you wore red silk panties -- then 
                         you are!
                              
                         And I still think Thomas Pynchon is 
                         full of shit.


                         I want you desperately!

               Crash can hardly keep up. So he slows her down --


                         Who are you? Do you have a job?


                         I teach part time at the Junior 
                         College. What if I told you I was 
                         through with Nuke? He learned his 
                         lessons quickly and left me.


                         And now you wanta teach me?


                         I don't imagine there's much I could 
                         teach you.


                         I doubt that.


                         Crash, I get wet just thinking about 
                         you.


                         I thought you wanted an 
                         "uncomplicated" boy?


                         I'm ready for a complicated man.


                         -- and as soon as we lose a game, 
                         he'll be back in your arms.


                         I said when I think about you, I get 
                         wet.


                         Annie, I think you should leave.

               Annie launches into a tirade without orchestration or self- 
               awareness. She's frustrated, confused, angry and...


                         God damn you -- what is happening? 
                         Is there no man who'll have me?
                              
                         This is the weirdest season I ever 
                         saw -- the Durham Bulls can't lose 
                         and I can't get laid!


                              
                         You okay?

               Annie slides against the wall down to the floor. Tears flow. 
               Her makeup runs. Her eyes are red.


                              
                         I need a drink.

               Crash gingerly helps her to her feet.





               ANNIE AND CRASH SIT IN THE CORNER of the empty bar.


                         Why baseball?


                              
                         I was raised in a Baptist church got 
                         dipped in the water when I was 5 -- 
                         born again before kindergarten... by 
                         the time I was 10 I knew it was 
                         bullshit and at 15 I ran away from 
                         home...

               SHE SMILES at the most painful memories.


                         pregnant, had an abortion, got 
                         pregnant again, had an abortion 
                         again... gave up men. Tried women. 
                         Missed men. My mother died.
                              
                         I bought a car for $200 and drove to 
                         Ft. Lauderdale to bury her.
                              
                         And after we'd sung some hymns in 
                         some wretched Florida funeral home, 
                         I went outside and something happened --

               Her tone becomes wistful, nostalgic.


                         The smell of cut grass in the warm 
                         March air overwhelmed me and I heard 
                         a noise --
                              
                         -- tok, tok, tok -- and some men 
                         shouting... then tok, tok, tok.

               Crash smiles slightly. He knows.


                         I crossed the street -- it was the 
                         New York Yankees spring training 
                         field -- tok, tok, tok, was the sound 
                         of a ball hitting a bat -- and I sat 
                         in the warm bleachers to think about 
                         my mother...
                              
                         And I saw him.


                         Who?


                         Thurman Munson.
                              
                         He was covered with dirt and he was 
                         fighting with everybody -- it was 
                         beautiful...
                              
                         And he called the ump a cocksucker 
                         and got thrown out of the game even 
                         though it was an exhibition!
                              
                         So I stayed in the bleachers all 
                         spring and gradually came to 
                         understand what's so great about 
                         baseball.


                         What's so great about baseball?


                         If you know where home plate is, 
                         then you know where 1st base is, and 
                         2nd, and everything else -- 'cause 
                         they're always in the same place in 
                         relation to home.
                              
                         Don't you see? If you know where 
                         home plate is, then you know where 
                         everything else in the universe is!

               Silence.


                         I don't know if I'd go that far.


                         It's true, It's true!
                              
                         Least it used to be true. It ain't 
                         possible that baseball's not enough 
                         anymore, is it, Crash?


                         It's possible.


                         No.


                         Are you gonna be waking up next to 
                         20 year old ballplayers when you're 



                         Well... I used to think that wasn't 
                         the worst thing in the world to look 
                         forward to. Lately I'm not so sure.


                         Why not?


                              
                         Whatta you mean "why not"? Are you 
                         gonna play forever?!

               Before Crash can answer --

               SUDDENLY A VOICE interrupts. They both turn to see:

               MILLIE EXCITEDLY DRAGGING JIMMY into the nearly empty bar.

               She leads him by the hand.


                         Annie, Annie! There she is -- we've 
                         been looking all over for ya. Hi 
                         Crash.

               MILLIE LEADS JIMMY right up to their table. And as they hold 
               hands. Jimmy stands there shyly.


                         Well tell 'em, honey.


                              
                         We're getting married.

               MILLIE STICKS OUT HER LEFT HAND Displays a huge ring.


                         Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for 
                         you.


                         He's a virgin.

               Jimmy squirms defensively.


                         Well, yeah...
                              
                         I guess that probably seems pretty 
                         corny to people like you.


                         Oh Jimmy, honey, I think it sounds 
                         wonderful!


                         Annie, will you be the bride's maid?





               GAME IN PROGRESS -- Nuke on the mound.

               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- Very high. Ball three.



               INSIDE THE DUGOUT -- Skip and Larry spitting tobacco.


                         Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't 
                         look loose. Anything bothering him?


                         He said his chakras were jammed and 
                         he was breathing out of the wrong 
                         nostril.


                              
                         Okay...





               NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS AGAIN -- Very high. Ball four.

               CRASH IS QUICKLY to the mound.


                         What's wrong?


                         I'm nervous -- my old man's here.

               NUKE MOTIONS -- They both look.

               -- P.O.V.  NUKE'S FATHER SITTING in a special box seat. The 
               man is 45, and is operating a home video camera taking 
               pictures of his son.


                         Hey, he's just your father, man -- 
                         he's as full of shit as anybody.

               TOMMY AND DEKE JOIN THEM at the mound.


                         What the hell's going on?


                         You breathing through the wrong 
                         fucking nostril again?


                         Hey, you guys hear Jimmy and Millie 
                         are engaged?! Wait'll I tell him 
                         she's gone down on half the Carolina 
                         League --


                              
                         Anybody says anything bad about 
                         Millie, I'll break his neck.


                         Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.

               JOSE THE FIRST BASEMAN JOINS THEM ALL at the mound.


                         Don't throw anything to me -- my 
                         girlfriend put a curse on my glove.


                         I'll take the curse off the son of a 
                         bitch!


                         Then you got to cut the head off a 
                         live rooster.


                         Shit.

               MICKEY JOINS THE CROWD from third base.


                         Don't worry, man, this umpire's a 
                         God damn racist.

               P.O.V.  THE UMPIRE -- He's black.



               THE DUGOUT -- SKIP AND LARRY watch the growing meeting.


                         What the hell's going on out there?


                         It's a damn convention.


                         Check it out.



               THE MOUND -- Larry joins the convention.


                         What the hell's going on out here?


                         Nuke's scared cause his nostrils are 
                         jammed and his old man's here, we 
                         need a live rooster to take the curse 
                         off Jose's glove, and nobody knows 
                         what to get Jimmy and Millie for 
                         their wedding present -- there's a 
                         whole lotta shit we're trying to 
                         deal with --


                         Oh. I thought there was a problem.





               ANNIE IS HELPING MILLIE make her WEDDING DRESS.

               The game can be heard on the radio in the b.g.


                         You should be at the game.


                         No, no -- I'm fine. Millie, how much 
                         time did you and Jimmy spend together 
                         before he proposed?

               Annie holds the dress up to Millie.


                         Five hours. We both just know.
                              
                         Do you think I deserve to wear white?


                         We all deserve to wear white.

               BOTH WOMEN TURN THEIR HEADS to the radio to listen.


                         ...line drive up the alley's gonna 
                         score at least two, here comes the 
                         relay --





               CRASH FLIPS HIS MASK -- A runner rounds third heading for 
               home. Here comes the throw, on a line. It hits once on the 
               infield grass, takes a long hop --

               AS THE RUNNER BARRELS TOWARD THE PLATE -- Crash takes the 
               throw.

               THE RUNNER SLIDES -- Crash blocks the plate. A cloud of dust. 
               A close play.

               THE UMPIRE SIGNALS "SAFE" -- And Crash flips out. In a second 
               he is nose to nose with the UMPIRE.


                         I got him on the knee!


                         You missed him!


                         God damn It, Jack, he still ain't 
                         touched the plate.

               THEIR FACES ARE INCHES APART -- Screaming face to face.


                         Don't bump me.


                         It was a cocksucking call!


                         Did you call me a cocksucker?


                         No! I said It was a cock-sucking 
                         call and you can't run me for that!


                         You missed the tag!


                         You spit on me!


                         I didn't spit on you!


                         You're in the wrong business, Jack -- 
                         you're Sears-Roebuck material!


                         You're close, Crash, you want me to 
                         run you? I'll run you!


                         You want me to call you a cocksucker?!


                         Try it! Go ahead. Call me a 
                         cocksucker!


                         Beg me!


                         Call me a cocksucker and you're outta 
                         here!


                         Beg me again!


                         Call me a cocksucker and you're outta 
                         here!


                         You're a cocksucker!


                         You're outta here!

               THE UMP THEATRICALLY THROWS CRASH out of the game.





               ANNIE AND MILLIE STARE at the radio.


                         ...I've never seen Crash so angry 
                         and frankly, Bull fans, he used a 
                         certain word that's a "no-no" with 
                         umpires...


                         Crash musta called the guy a 
                         cocksucker


                         God, he's so romantic...





               CRASH STANDS AGAINST the water, letting it stream across 
               him. He raises a can of beer to his lips, drinks it slowly 
               in the shower.

               As the water runs over Crash...


                         When Crash got throwed out, the game 
                         got out of hand...
                              
                         ...Jose made three errors with his 
                         cursed mitt...

               JOSE BOOTS A GROUND BALL -- A runner scores.


                         Nuke never quite got in the groove 
                         though he didn't pitch bad...

               NUKE JUST MISSES WITH A PITCH -- Ball four.


                         ...and the winning streak came to an 
                         end with a 3-2 loss...
                              
                         The good news was that a man was 
                         about to come calling... the bad 
                         news was -- it was the wrong guy.





               AS PIAF PLAYS on the stereo -- A knock at the door.

               ANNIE GOES TO THE DOOR -- Then refuses to answer it at first.  
               She hides in a corner. Bites her fist.


                         Annie! You gotta be in there -- I 
                         can hear that crazy Mexican singer!

               Annie smiles slightly, and opens the door.


                         We lost.


                         It's okay...

               She opens the door fully. Nuke's father stands there.


                         I'd like you to meet my father.


                              
                         Oh -- won't YOU come in?





               AS THEY ENTER -- She leads them into the kitchen.


                         Ebby's told me a lot about you.


                         Uh oh...
                              
                         Can I offer you some coffee?



               She puts a pot of water with a swirl of graciousness.


                         Yeah... Ebby tells me you're a very 
                         spiritual woman. He tells me you've 
                         taught him a lot about discipline 
                         and self-control.

               Annie and Nuke exchange glances. Nuke smiles.


                         He's a good student.


                         We were worried that Ebby might get 
                         involved with the wrong crowd in 
                         professional baseball -- we're so 
                         pleased, he met a Christian woman.


                         Praise the Lord, eh?

               The Piaf record begins skipping in the next room.


                         Oh my -- I better fix that. Ebby 
                         will you help me? I'm no good with 
                         mechanical things

               Nuke picks up his cue and follows her to:



               Annie fixes the record.


                         I couldn't dump my old man but maybe 
                         later I can sneak away from him...


                         You don't have to...


                         I'm starting to understand what you're 
                         teaching me. I mean the panties and 
                         the nostrils and all that shit... I 
                         mean I'm getting it --


                         So am I. Nuke, honey, we need to 
                         talk --

               Nuke gets very aggressive and playful, pinning her.


                         Aw hell, let's have a quickie right 
                         here --


                         -- but you're father's in there!


                         Crash says I gotta quit worrying 
                         about him -- c'mon, honey, we got a 
                         lotta catching up to do --

               He pins her to the wall, she squirms away.


                         Nuke -- we do need to talk!





               Nuke's father is studying pictures on Annie's wall.

               CLOSE ON A HELMUT NEWTON PHOTO -- A nude woman, two afghans, 
               and a toilet.



               CLOSE ON A POSTER OF A MARIJUANA LEAF with the inscription 
               "Better Living Through Mexican Agriculture".

               Nuke's father is a bit unsettled by all this, when:

               The phone rings.

               ANNIE SWEEPS BACK into the kitchen -- saved by the bell -- 
               to answer the phone. Nuke trails.


                              
                         Hello? Skip? Yeah, as a matter of 
                         fact, he is here.

               She hands the phone to Nuke.


                         It's Skip, for you.


                         Yeah, Skip, it's me.
                              
                         Jeez... Jeez... God... Jeez...

               Nuke hangs up the phone. Looks at Annie and his father.


                         I'm going to the Show.
                              
                         They're sending me up to finish out 
                         the season with the Big Club. I'm 
                         going to the Show!

               NUKE'S FATHER LEAPS TO HIS FEET and embraces his son.


                         Let's have a quick word of prayer, 
                         right here, to thank the Lord for 
                         all this --


                         Oh let's not...


                         I gotta leave first thing in the 
                         morning.


                         That's great!


                         How can I possibly thank you?

               He embraces her rather formally.


                         Just pitch well and do good.

               Nuke hustles his father out of the house.


                         I will, I will -- C'mon, Dad, I'll 
                         dump you off. I gotta find Crash.

               As they exit, Nuke's father turns to Annie:


                         God bless you.


                              
                         She will, Mr. LaLoosh, she will...

               ANNIE SITS DOWN in a kitchen chair. An enormous sigh.





               Nuke knocks on Crash's door. Nobody home. Tony is arriving 
               with his GROUPIE GIRLFRIEND to the next room.


                         Crash ain't there. He never gets 
                         back till four or five --


                         Where does he go?


                         Well, I'd rather not say.


                         They called me up to the Show and I 
                         wanta tell Crash goodbye.

               TONY COMES OVER AND GIVES NUKE a heartfelt "five".


                         Goddamn, that's great! Jesus!
                              
                         Listen, Crash don't like anybody to 
                         know it but --
                              
                         Most nights he goes down to, you 
                         know, down to Niggertown. To 
                         Sandy's... the whorehouse.


                         He goes to a whorehouse every night?


                         Don't tell him I told you -- he'd 
                         break my neck.

               CLOSE ON NUKE -- Disturbed.





               A CAB MOVES SLOWLY through a poor neighborhood. Stops at:

               AN OLD HOUSE -- Decades of ad hoc add-ons.


                         That's Sandy's. Keep your extra cash 
                         In your shoes.

               NUKE GETS OUT and goes to the door.





               NUKE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR -- A small barred window opens.

               A face appears -- a TOUGH BLACK, SANDY, 50.


                         What'you want, kid?


                         I'm looking for somebody.


                         Who ain't?


                         Looking for Crash Davis.


                         Ain't here.


                         I'm Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.


                              
                         Your breaking ball's getting better 
                         but ya need a change up.

               The door opens. Nuke enters.





               NUKE ENTERS TENTATIVELY -- Another world. Grim. Sleazy.

               The Doorman leads him down a hallway full of doors. A BLACK 
               PROSTITUTE enters a room with a HUGE REDNECK. As they go 
               down the hallway, and as they do:

               We begin hearing singing -- raucous, soulful, drunk.

               NUKE STOPS IN A DOORWAY -- Looks into the "waiting room".

               -- P.O.V.  SEVERAL HOOKERS in various stages of undress, sit 
               on couches and chairs. Bored, smoking, ancient. The ONE WHITE 
               HOOKER, a skinny 25 year old, accompanies on a guitar, 
               struggling to keep up. And a couple HOOKERS are hanging around 
               a piano that --

               CRASH IS PLAYING and singing. He doesn't look up. Crash is 
               dressed but barefoot. A cigarette dangles from his mouth as 
               he accompanies himself with decent cocktail lounge chords.

               Two Hookers at the piano hum along.


                              
                         But when she does get weary -- Try a 
                         little tenderness...

               NUKE STEPS INTO THE ROOM -- All the Hookers rise in 
               anticipation of a new customer. Crash keeps playing, never 
               looking up.


                              
                         You know she's waiting, just 
                         anticipating, the things that she'll 
                         never possess...
                              
                         While she's there waiting -- Try a 
                         little tenderness...

               Nuke interrupts the instrumental passage:


                         Crash. I'm going to the Show.

               Crash Ignores him, keeps playing.


                         Club's expanding its roster to finish 
                         the season --


                         Shut up. I'm playing.
                              
                         Oh you won't regret it, young girls 
                         don't forget it, lost in their own 
                         wilderness...
                              
                         But it's all so easy -- Just try a 
                         little tenderness...

               As Crash plays on --


                         I'm going to the Show.


                         Then go.

               NUKE GRABS CRASH by the hair and jerks him to his feet. The 
               two men are face to face.


                         I'm trying to thank you.


                         Let go of me!

               NUKE LETS HIM GO and Crash staggers drunkenly against the 
               piano, regaining his balance as:

               SANDY RUSHES IN WITH A GUN to break it up.


                         He makin' trouble for you, Mr. Davis?


                         No, no, Sandy, put it down.
                              
                         Nuke, you know Sandy Grimes? Hit 
                         .367 at Louisville in 155.


                         I hit .371.


                         He hit .371 -- C'mon, Nuke -- you 
                         and me, let's step outside and settle 
                         this.


                         Settle what?


                         C'mon!


                         I don't wanta fight you, I wanta 
                         thank you. Let's have a drink and 
                         forget this --


                         God damn it, you fucking virgin prick -- 
                         step outside.

               Crash drunkenly heads out the back door in his underwear.  
               Nuke reluctantly follows.





               Several of the Hookers follow to watch. Crash is drunk and 
               lost. Nuke in control.


                         C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.


                         You fuck!


                         Why am I a fuck?


                         Why are you a fuck?
                              
                         'Cause you got talent. I got brains. 
                         But you got talent! You're God damn 
                         left arm is worth a million dollars 
                         a year.
                              
                         All my limbs put together are worth 
                         7 cents a pound -- and that's for 
                         science and dog meat.


                         You're a great catcher.


                         Come over here into the light so I 
                         can kick your ass.


                         No.


                         Okay, I'll kick your ass there.

               Crash takes a step toward Nuke. Pulls up his bare feet 
               quickly, stepping on a sharp stone.


                         ...God damn... I forgot my fucking 
                         shoes. Honey, go get my shoes.

               One of the Hookers goes inside for his shoes.


                         I'll take you back to the hotel.


                              
                         You know what the difference is 
                         between hitting .250 and hitting 
                         .300? I got it figured out.
                              
                         Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at 
                         bats is 50 points. Okay? There's 6 
                         months in a season, that's about 25 
                         weeks -- you get one extra flare a 
                         week -- just one -- a gork, a ground 
                         ball with eyes, a dying quail -- 
                         just one more dying quail a week and 
                         you're in Yankee Stadium!





               THE HOOKER FINDS CRASH'S SHOES -- Starts to bring them out 
               to him when... she notices cash in one of them. The Hooker 
               takes a few bills for herself, and continues out --



               BACK IN THE ALLEY -- Crash finishes his tirade as:



               He struggles drunkenly to put them on.


                         Forget it. You ain't worth thanking --

               NUKE STARTS TO WALK AWAY -- Crash fires his one free shoe at 
               Nuke hitting him in the back of the head.

               NUKE WHIRLS -- Comes after Crash.


                         Come on, Meat...

               CRASH SWINGS WILDLY -- Nuke ducks it and levels Crash with a 
               short right hand.

               CRASH CRASHES INTO SOME GARBAGE CANS -- Lies there on his 
               back for several beats. Nuke stares.

               CLOSE ON CRASH -- Blood trickles from his mouth.


                         Nuke... tell me something. Did you 
                         hit me with your right or your left?


                         My right.

               Silence. Crash's next line is both drunk and sober and we 
               don't know if he's just being clever or if, somehow, he's 
               staged It all. Maybe even he doesn't know.


                         Good. Good. That's terrific...


                         What?


                         If ya get in a fight with some 
                         asshole, never hit his with your 
                         pitching hand. Ya might get injured.
                              
                         That's another lesson for ya -- now 
                         quit fucking around and help me up.

               CRASH REACHES UP A HAND FOR HELP -- Nuke stares back.

               AND FINALLY NUKE REACHES DOWN AND HELPS CRASH to his feet.


                         Ya look like shit.

               The two men head inside.





               NUKE'S PORSCHE -- The Clubhouse Boy drags Nuke's out to the 
               car and loads the trunk. Annie, Larry and a COUPLE KIDS AND 
               DOGS are watching.





               NUKE CLEANS OUT HIS LOCKER -- Filling his travel bag.

               Crash sits on a stool next to him. Sober.


                         Sorry about last night.


                         Forget it.


                         I have been known, on occasion, to 
                         howl at the moon. D'you understand 
                         that?


                         No.


                         You will.
                              
                         Look, Nuke -- these Big League hitters 
                         are gonna light you up like a pin 
                         ball machine for awhile -- don't 
                         worry about it. Be cocky and arrogant 
                         even when you're getting beat. That's 
                         the secret.
                              
                         You gotta play this game with fear 
                         and arrogance.


                         Fear and ignorance.


                              
                         No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, 
                         not ignorance!


                              
                         I know. I just like to see you get 
                         all worked up.

               Crash calms down. Sighs. Nuke nods and picks up his bags.


                              
                         Well, I got Annie all warmed up for 
                         ya...
                              
                         She's just waiting for you to show 
                         up, y'know...


                         I don't need a crazy woman in my 
                         life.


                         Maybe you do.
                              
                         Y'know I'm starting to like this 
                         game -- baseball's a helluva good 
                         way to make a living.

               Crash speaks with quiet passion, from his soul.


                         It's the best, Nuke... the absolute 
                         fucking best.


                         Yeah, thanks for everything.

               They shake hands, and Nuke heads out the door.


                         Nuke --
                              
                         Good luck.


                         You too... Meat.

               Nuke smiles. A little arrogance and fear.





               NUKE TOSSES HIS BAG in the Porsche and motions to Annie.  
               They step away from the others.


                         Well I guess this is it.


                              
                         I won't be needing these anymore.

               NUKE PULLS ANNIE'S RED PANTIES from his jacket pocket.

               The frilly, silk lace is tattered. The panties have been 
               through the mill. She accepts them graciously.


                         Neither will I.


                         I think I'm ready for the Show.


                         Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh -- don't 
                         think too much.


                         Don't worry.

               They look at each other awkwardly, sweetly, and:

               NUKE KISSES ANNIE GENTLY ON THE LIPS -- They hesitate, and 
               Nuke heads for his Porsche.

               CRASH ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY to watch. Nuke bids farewell to 
               his father and climbs into his car.


                         I gotta go now, Dad.


                         I was thinking I could fly up and 
                         spend a week in the Big Leagues with 
                         you -- help you get comfortable.


                         No. If I screw up, I wanta do it 
                         alone. I'll call.


                         We'll be praying for you.


                         Dad -- if my curveball is hanging, 
                         God ain't gonna help me.


                         We'll pray anyway.


                              
                         If it makes you and mom feel better, 
                         go for it. I gotta run --

               They shake hands, and:

               CRASH'S P.O.V. -- NUKE ROARS AWAY in his Porsche, leaving a 
               trail of dust in the Stadium parking lot.





               MILLIE AND JIMMY'S WEDDING -- A formal wedding on the 
               pitcher's mound. Millie in white. Jimmy in his uniform. Skip 
               is the best man, also in uniform, and several players and 
               groupies are the attendants, Annie as the Bride's Maid.

               Organ music plays the wedding march.

               JIMMY LIFTS MILLIE'S VEIL and kisses her. The stands are 
               full of fans.

               JIMMY LEADS MILLIE DOWN THE "AISLE" towards home plate.





               CLOSE ON SCOREBOARD -- Ninth inning. Durham is leading by a 
               score of 1 to 0. Two outs.

               JIMMY IS PITCHING -- He delivers. The batter rockets a line 
               drive up the alley. A PENINSULA RUNNER races from first, 
               rounding third, trying to score. A relay.

               CRASH WAITS AT THE PLATE -- Here comes the runner. Here comes 
               the throw. A close play. A terrible collision.

               Crash goes rolling. The umpire waits -- and in a cloud of 
               dust, Crash holds up the ball.

               THE CROWD ROARS -- Jimmy jumps victoriously in the air.





               The air of victory. The mood is up and goofy. Beer cans are 
               squirted at Jimmy, the groom.


                         I wanta thank everybody and the Lord 
                         for the victory, it's a wonderful 
                         way to celebrate my marriage -- and 
                         I guess we're all back on a winning 
                         streak, he? A few raucous "Fuckin 
                         A's" from the team.


                         Hey, Jimmy -- we chipped in and kind 
                         got a little gift for ya of a special 
                         wedding cake from the Durham Bulls.

               DEKE CARRIES OUT AN WEDDING CAKE -- It's X-Rated. The 
               decorative Bride and Groom are fucking. Jimmy's embarrassed 
               but it's all good natured.



               CRASH COMING OUT OF THE SHOWER -- Toweling off, watching the 
               innocent, vulgar fun. He sits down in front of his locker, 
               drying his hair, when the CLUBHOUSE BOY approaches:


                         Hey, Crash -- Skip wants to see ya.

               CRASH RISES AND HEADS FOR SKIP'S CUBICLE -- Wearing only a 
               towel and his shower shoes.



               INSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- Skip and Larry sit in postgame 
               routine, checking charts, smoking, half dressed.

               CRASH ENTERS as he's still drying off.


                         Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?


                         Crash, shut the door.

               And it hits him. Crash looks at Skip, who looks down at the 
               floor, unwilling to face Crash who then looks at Larry, who 
               also looks away nervously.

               CRASH SHUTS THE DOOR -- The party rages beyond.


                              
                         This is the toughest job a manager 
                         has...

               CLOSE ON CRASH -- He's been in the game too long to be 
               surprised; nonetheless, he's surprised. And hurt. His stoicism 
               is professional.


                         The organization wants to make a 
                         change... now that Nuke's gone they 
                         wanta bring up some young catcher...


                         Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg... 
                         probably a bust.


                         I put in a word for you with the 
                         organization -- told 'em I thought 
                         you'd make a fine minor league manager 
                         someday... Might be an opening at 
                         Salem next year --

               EXTREME CLOSE UP ON CRASH -- His eyes are moist.


                         Helluva year, Crash -- you know how 
                         it is.

               Silence.

               Crash stands there nearly nude. He just nods slightly. Without 
               rancor or bitterness, he turns and re-enters the raucous 
               locker room.





               CRASH WALKS THE STREETS ALONE -- Crash stops in front of a 
               window and takes his batting stroke, studying the reflection.







               CRASH DRINKING ALONE at the end of a bar.





               CRASH WANDERS ALONG into the residential neighborhoods.

               HE STARTS ACROSS A QUIET INTERSECTION Stops. Looks at the 
               street signs. He CHANGES DIRECTION, walks on.





               The windows glow. After midnight.

               CRASH STARES AT THE HOUSE -- Hesitates, then walks up the 
               porch stairs. Knocks at the door. Moments later:

               ANNIE OPENS THE DOOR -- She looks beautiful. Almost as if 
               she was expecting him. At first, silence. Then:


                         I got released.


                         I heard already.

               SHE OPENS THE DOOR -- Crash enters Annie's house.





               ANNIE PUTS ON her favorite Piaf record.

               ANNIE POURS A DRINK for both of them.

               CRASH PUTS A HAND ON HER HIP -- Annie closes her eyes, a 
               tiny gasp. He kisses her forehead. She kisses his neck. A 
               tiny smile from Crash. The same from Annie.

               SHE KISSES HIM on the corner of his mouth. Her hand finds 
               the back of his head and she runs her fingers through his 
               hair.

               CRASH RESPONDS -- They kiss slowly, deeply.  As --

               HIS HAND ON HER HIP PULLS UP HER SKIRT -- By degrees, the 
               skirt is raised up her stocking covered leg. At last exposing 
               the beloved BLACK GARTER SNAPS -- Crash's hand expertly holds 
               up the skirt and effortlessly UNSNAPS THE GARTER with a 
               minimum of effort.

               FLICK, FLICK, FLICK -- The garter snaps are free.


                         Oh my...



               THE BEDROOM -- Crash carries Annie to the bed.



               ANNIE'S FOOT KICKS OVER A LAMP onto the floor.



               ANNIE'S BLOUSE FRONT -- Flick, flick, flick. Crash unbuttons 
               it with one hand in seconds. Even Annie is startled with the 
               speed and ease of Crash's hand.



               HER HAND SLIDES UNDER THE WAISTBAND of his underwear



               HIS HAND SLIDES UP UNDER HER panties.



               A FULL EMBRACE ON THE EDGE OF THE BED -- Remnants of clothes 
               cover parts of their bodies.  They tumble out of control to 
               the floor.



               ANNIE'S HAND GRABS ONTO A DRESSER LEG -- A carved oak antique, 
               her hand holds on tight and shakes the dresser.



               THE DRESSER TOP SHAKES -- Makeup bottles and pictures and 
               dozens of Annie's special things rattle and fall



               ANNIE'S READ RESTS ON CRASH'S STOMACH -- Post coital, they 
               lie on the floor blissfully as Piaf finishes.



               ANNIE CHANGES THE RECORD to Hank Williams.



               THE KITCHEN -- ANNIE AND CRASH eat an after mid after sex 
               snack. Crash eats a bowl of Wheaties. They each wear one of 
               her robes.



               Annie sits, munching a carrot and rolling a joint of marijuana 
               she keeps in a Victorian jewel box.


                         ...so you see in a former lifetime 
                         I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the 
                         Czarette of Russia? What do you think?


                         How come in former lifetimes, 
                         everybody was someone famous?
                              
                         How come nobody ever says they were 
                         Joe Schmo?


                         It doesn't work like that.
                              
                         God, you're gorgeous. Want to dance?

               THEY KISS AGAIN -- And fall gradually onto the table top.



               ANNIE SITS ON TOP OF CRASH lying on the kitchen table.

               He stretches out a leg and:

               KICKS THE BOWL OF CEREAL to the floor. It smashes -- ceramics, 
               milk, cereal go everywhere. As:

               THEY START MAKING LOVE AGAIN in the glaring kitchen light.



               CRASH AND ANNIE DANCE in her living room.



               THE BEDROOM -- Crash is handcuffed to the bed. He seems 
               perfectly happy as Annie reads Walt Whitman.


                         ...mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof 
                         of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw 
                         hinges...



               ANNIE HANDCUFFED TO THE BED -- Crash reads.


                         ...wrist and wrist joints, hand, 
                         palm, knuckles, thumb, fore-finger, 
                         finger-joints, finger-nail...



               CRASH AT ANNIE'S RECORD COLLECTION -- He thumbs through it 
               quickly, puts on a new record.

               The Dominoes sing "Sixty Minute Man".  And...



               THE BATHROOM -- Candlelight around the bathtub. All we can 
               make out is two heads, two bodies, sloshing wildly In the 
               dim glow. Water splashes, dowses some candles.



               CRASH AND ANNIE IN BED READING -- Each with a copy of a Thomas 
               Pynchon novel. Crash tosses it aside. And disappears under 
               the sheets, playing with her as she struggles to keep reading.  
               She puts down the book.



               ANNIE APPLYING EYE MAKEUP TO CRASH -- Who doesn't resist, 
               seems even amused. He kisses her deeply, slowly. She kisses 
               him back. They fall onto the bed.



               P.O.V.  OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW -- Dawn. A bird chirps.

               And we hear a record skipping, repeating endlessly.

               PAN ACROSS THE KITCHEN -- Overturned chairs, spilled and 
               broken cereal bowls, liquor bottles.

               PAN ACROSS THE BEDROOM -- A disaster. Clothes scattered across 
               the floor, overturned lamps, the bed lies at a cockeyed angle.  
               Annie and Crash lie face down -- asleep, utterly spent.

               CRASH WAKES UP SLOWLY -- Reaches up and pulls his underwear 
               off of a lampshade, pulls them on, and gets slowly out of 
               bed. He staggers across the bedroom floor, stumbling a bit, 
               into:

               THE LIVING ROOM -- He stumbles across the trashed room.  
               Record album covers, more liquor bottles, pillows, cushions, 
               pictures hanging crookedly on the wall.

               CRASH TAKES THE SKIPPING RECORD off the player and breathes 
               a sigh of relief. He sees his pants lying on the floor and 
               pulls them on.

               CRASH OPENS A DRAWER -- Pulls out a piece of paper and a 
               pencil. He starts writing...





               Sun streams in. Annie opens her eyes. Rubs them. Reaches 
               over for Crash. Her hand hits a note. She whirls. He's gone. 
               Only a note.

               SHE SITS UP WITH A START and reads the note.


                         Crash said he had to get an early 
                         start to drive to Asheville in the 
                         South Atlantic League where he heard 
                         they might need a catcher to finish 
                         out the season...

               ZOOM IN EXTREME CLOSE UP OF NOTE -- "Love, Crash".





               CRASH IN HIS CAR heading for Asheville.





               CRASH KNOCKING ON THE BASEBALL OFFICE DOOR -- Looking for 
               work.





               CRASH UNLOADING HIS GEAR into yet another locker.





               ANNIE SCRUBBING HER KITCHEN FLOOR -- Down on her hands and 
               knees, picking up the broken cereal bowl.


                         The house smelled like sex for days. 
                         It was wonderful. The only real 
                         cleaning I did was on the kitchen 
                         floor 'cause who likes to walk on 
                         spilt cereal?

               SHE FINDS A BIT OF A JOINT on the floor as she's cleaning.  
               She picks it up, sits on the floor under the table, and lights 
               the tiny joint.


                         The funny thing is, I stopped worrying 
                         about Nuke. Somehow I knew nothing 
                         would stop him. Crash was right --
                         Nuke had a gift.





               NUKE IN STREET CLOTHES IN THE DUGOUT of an empty stadium. 
               50,000 seats. Slick. Awesome. He's being interviewed by a 
               BIG LEAGUE REPORTER, who has a small tape deck and has stuck 
               mike in Nuke's face.


                              
                         Y'know, I'm just happy to be here 
                         and hope I can help the ballclub. I 
                         just want to give it my best shot 
                         and good Lord willing, things'll 
                         work out... gotta play 'em one day 
                         at a time, Y'know...

               THE BIG LEAGUE REPORTER nods attentively as Nuke knowingly 
               delivers the clichs like a veteran.





               In sharpest contrast to the Big League stadium, a rickety 
               old wooden grandstand, carved into the pine covered hillside.

               CRASH STEPS TO THE PLATE -- In a uniform we've never seen 
               him in, of course. The Asheville Tourists. He picks up some 
               dirt, rubs it on his hands. He's as intense as ever. Still 
               playing for keeps.


                              
                         C'mon, Meat, throw me that weak ass 
                         shit -- c'mon, bring the heat, bring 
                         it, bring it...

               CRASH'S P.O.V. -- SLO-MO AS THE PITCHER WINDS AND delivers a 
               fastball right down the pipe.





               ANNIE LIES IN BED READING -- She suddenly jerks up.


                         I was reading in bed when Crash hit 
                         his 247th home run. I knew the moment 
                         it happened...





               CRASH UNLOADS A MONSTROUS HOME RUN deep into the trees. He 
               stands at home plate watching it... like Reggie or the Babe.

               And doesn't move. For several seconds he indulges himself 
               uncharacteristically -- until...

               THE OPPOSING CATCHER SHOVES HIM toward first.


                         Get your ass in gear...

               CRASH SMILES and takes the home run trot slowly. As he heads 
               toward first, HE RAISES A CLINCHED FIST for a brief moment, 
               a tiny gesture of triumph. And then, routinely, he just 
               circles the bases.

               A HUNDRED FANS APPLAUD ROUTINELY as he circles the bases.





               SHE LIGHTS A CANDLE for the home run. Above the candles, 
               displayed in the shrine, are her RED PANTIES.


                         I lit a candle for Crash's dinger... 
                         and tried to root the Durham Bulls 
                         home to a pennant.





               ANNIE AND JACKSON OPEN AN UMBRELLA in her familiar place in 
               the stadium. Umbrellas go up all around, as:

               THE RAINS COME -- The players huddle-in the dugouts.

               IN THE DUGOUT Skip and Larry reading copies of "The Tantric 
               Yoga of Sex". And spitting tobacco.


                         The Kid from Lynchburg wasn't good 
                         enough to hold Crash's jockstrap if 
                         ya ask me, and Nuke's replacement 
                         had a fastball that I coulda hit
                              
                         We had a three game lead with two 
                         weeks to go when the rains came.

               THE GROUND CREW DRAGS TARPS over the mound and the plate.


                         It rained and rained and I thought 
                         of driving down to Asheville to see 
                         Crash but then I thought "No, what 
                         you pursue, eludes you". I had to 
                         trust Quantum Physics and the Church 
                         of Baseball.
                              
                         It ain't always easy being this 
                         religious...

               ANNIE AND JACKSON POP OPEN THEIR UMBRELLAS and walk out of 
               the ballpark towards home.





               ANNIE AND JACKSON UNDER UMBRELLAS -- He turns down one street, 
               she heads toward home.





               AS SHE APPROACHES -- She stops. Looks up. Crash's beat up 
               car in the driveway.

               P.O.V.  CRASH SITTING ON THE PORCH SWING Still raining.

               CLOSE ON ANNIE -- She hesitates, and smiles.


                         Oh my...

               ANNIE SITS DOWN on the porch owing next to Crash.


                         What happened?


                         I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em 
                         up.

               A moment of silence over the significance of him quitting.


                         I'm quitting too. Boys, not baseball.


                         There might be an opening for a 
                         manager at Salem next spring.


                         Salem, Massachusetts? Where all the 
                         witches were?


                         Yeah... you a witch?


                         Not yet. It takes years of practice...

               He smiles slightly and takes her hand.


                         You think I could make it to the 
                         Show as a manager?


                         You'd be great, just great...
                              
                         'Cause you understand non-linear 
                         thinking even though it seems like 
                         baseball is a linear game 'cause of 
                         the lines and the box scores an'  
                         all -- but the fact is that there's 
                         a spacious-"non-time kind of time" 
                         to it...


                              
                         Annie --


                         What?


                         I got a lotta time to hear your 
                         theories and I wanta hear every damn 
                         one of 'em... but right now I'm tired 
                         and I don't wanta think about baseball 
                         and I don't wanta think about Quantum 
                         Physics... I don't wanta think about 
                         nothing...
                              
                         I just wanta be.


                         I can do that, too.

               He rises, takes her hand, and they head inside.

               And as the rains fall on Durham...





               THE SHRINE GLOWS -- Candles everywhere. Rain pours down on 
               the windows outside. And...

               ANNIE AND CRASH SIT ON THE COUCH together, in silence.


                         Walt Whitman once said -- "I see 
                         great things in baseball. It's our 
                         game -- the American game
                              
                         He said "it will repair our losses 
                         and be a blessing to us"...
                              
                         You could look it up....

               The music -- Dave Frishberg sings "Van Lingle Mungo".
