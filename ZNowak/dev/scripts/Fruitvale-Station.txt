      We open on an expensive looking flip cellphone sitting on a
      dresser. Next to it, a large zip lock bag of marijuana. We
      stay here.


                What's your resolution?


                I'm gonna cut carbs.





    Green                                       2A.



                You trippin. You look fine. Plus
                you Mexican. You cut carbs and you
                can't eat nothin yo grandma cooks.





    Goldenrod                                       3.



                FUCK YOU...You just gotta help me
                stick to it. It only takes 30 days
                to form a habit. Then it becomes
                second nature.


                Really? Who told you that?


                ... Oprah

      Oscar laughs hard at this.                                       


                What's yours.                                          


                I'm gonna quit selling trees.                          

      The PHONE VIBRATES and RINGS "MARCUS CALLING" shows on the
      outer screen.

      Oscar's moves towards the cellphone.


                Osc.

      Oscar stops in his tracks.


                Don't go out there tonight, stay
                home.





    Goldenrod                                         4.





                You gonna give me a reason to?

      Sophina doesn't answer. The phone rings again. Oscar's hand
      quickly picks it up and flips it open. We follow the phone to
      his face and we see him for the first time, a 22 year old
      Black man with a warm smile.


                    
                Aye bruh it's bad tonight. I gotta
                catch you tomorrow.

      He closes it before the guy on the other end can respond. He
      takes the phone with him as he climbs back into bed with
      SOPHINA MESA, a curvy 24 year old Mexican American woman.


                Look, I'm not going out, you happy
                now?

      Sophina nods. Oscar moves closer to her and kisses her on her
      neck. She kisses him back a bit, then scoots away.                  

      Oscar kisses her again. Puts his hand in her hair.


                Osc. Osc, hold up.

      Oscar stops. Sophina scoots away even further.





    Pink                                               5.



                Man, wussup? I been home hella
                long...


                I don't know...Every time you touch
                me, I can't help to think about how
                you was touchin that Bitch.

      Oscar shakes his head at this, sighs.


                You know what? You right, go.


                What I gotta do? I'm here, right
                now. I fucked up one time, alright?


                No, you fucking got caught, one
                time. You gonna sit here and tell
                me that was the first time you
                kicked it with that Bitch. Never
                seen her before that huh?


                Look I'm done with that shit. All I
                want is you and T, forever.

      Sophina looks at him, searching for the truth in his eyes.


                What you mean, forever?


                Let me show you.

      Oscar kisses her, moves in. Sophina scoots away from him.

      KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. Oscar and Sophina look over at the door.


                Daddy.

      Oscar looks at Sophina.


                What? She's askin for you.





    Green                                            6.



                    
                Hold on, T.

      Oscar jumps up and grabs the bag of weed off of the dresser
      and hides it in the closet.

      He rushes over and opens the door where we see TATIANA GRANT,
      a cute 4 year old girl, standing wearing footie pajamas.


                I can't sleep...

      Before Tatiana can even finish, Oscar has her in his arms. He
      brings her over to the bed and places her next to Sophina.


                You want to sleep in here with
                Mommy and Daddy?

      Tatiana nods.


                You know better than that T.
                    
                What time is it?

      Oscar picks up his phone and looks at it.


                Damn, it's after midnight.

      He opens his phone up. Presses compose text message (as he
      types the message, the words appear as graphics across the
      screen like Sub Titles)




      Oscar sends the text off. He hooks his phone up to the
      charger and hits the light switch, leaving us in darkness.


                Daddy.


                Wussup, baby?


                I don't want to move to Livermore.

      Oscar and Sophina laugh at this.




    Goldenrod                                         7.



                Hella nosy...


                Don't worry T, aint nobody's moving
                right now. Go to sleep.                                 
                                                                        




      Oscar stands in the shower, letting the water run over his
      head. There looks to be a lot on his mind.




      Sophina and Oscar move around the small kitchen like a well
      oiled machine. Sophina, wearing a WalMart uniform, makes two
      lunches. Oscar wipes milk from Tatiana's face and fixes her
      hair.


                Mommy can I have two of the fruit
                snacks today?


                No, T. You can take an extra apple
                if you want.


                But mommy I-


                Don't argue T.

      Tatiana pouts. Sophina downs a cup full of orange juice,
      grabs both lunch bags, Tatiana, and heads for the door.


                Com'on Osc. We gotta stop and get
                gas too.


                We got enough to get yall there.

      Sophina shoots Oscar a look.


                Go start the car up. You got your
                keys?





    Pink                                            8.


      Sophina nods.


                Go. I gotta grab my beanie.

      Sophina and Tatiana leave. Oscar watches them go for a beat.
      He turns to the cabinet.







      Oscar and Tatiana walk to the downstairs entrance of a two
      story house. A picture of an apple tree is painted next to
      the door. Oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a
      frizz in her hair. He looks back at the car.

      We see that Sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down
      mirror.

      Oscar turns to Tatiana. He then takes her hand, and places
      something inside of it.

      Tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a
      small bag of fruit snacks. She looks up at Oscar with a
      bright eyed expression. But Oscar quickly places his finger
      over his lips.

      Tatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile.
      She gives him a swift kiss on the cheek. He stands up and
      knocks on the front door.

      MRS. STACY a motherly looking Black woman in her 50's opens
      the door.


                Good morning Tatiana!





    Green                                            9.



                Good morning Mrs. Stacy.

      Tatiana heads into the house.

      Oscar smiles at Mrs. Stacey, and she nods back. He watches
      Tatiana run off into house.







      Oscar and Sophina look on at the WAL MART Entrance.


                See? Told you we'd make it. The
                light aint even on yet.

      She looks at the dashboard where there is a PICTURE of Oscar
      holding Tatiana tucked in the glass. The fuel gage sits
      almost under E, but the light still isn't on.

      She stares at the store entrance.


                You gonna go home and sleep, right?


                Naw, Imma go up to the job. Get
                some stuff for tonight.


                Ugh. I'd rather die than come here
                on my day off.
                    
                What time we supposed to be at your
                grandma's?


                Prolly like seven.


                We gonna go to Frisco again? Catch
                the fireworks?

      Oscar nods. Sophina smiles at the idea of Frisco, for a beat.


                Let me get in here.





     Pink                                              10.


       She quickly sits up. Oscar leans over to give her a kiss on
       the cheek, makes a farting sound on her neck instead.

       Sophina chuckles at this as she gets out of the car.


                 Bye.


                     
                 Love you too.

       SLAM! Sophina shuts the door on him. Oscar laughs. His smile
       fades, as he watches her go inside.




       Oscar, now in the car by himself rides in the car listening
       to HIP HOP MUSIC. He comes to a red light.

       He looks at the car radio clock: 8:58 AM.

       He thinks to himself for a beat, he looks dissatisfied. He
       turns his music up for a beat and listens to it. He looks
       around, still not at ease. He turns off his music and pulls
       out his cellphone. He takes a quick look around to see what
       cars are around, before dialing numbers. CALLING MOM flashes
       on the screen. He holds the phone to his ear.






       A beautiful Black woman in her late 40's wears a UPS
       manager's uniform, this is WANDA JOHNSON. She walks towards
       the entrance of her store, when her cellphone rings in her
       purse. She pulls it out, stressed. Answers it without
       looking.


                 Hello?


                 Last shot right here, you sure you
                 want to work on your birthday? You
                 still got time to catch a cold...

       Wanda's face brightens up with a familiar looking smile.





     Pink                                      10aA.



                 Hello Son! Thanks for the text last
                 night.





     Pink                                 10A.



                 No problem. Come on, let's go
                 celebrate right now.





     Pink                                       11.


       Wanda laughs at this.


                 As tempting as that sounds... this
                 place would be a mess without me
                 today.
                     
                 We close early though...


                 Okay...You still want me to get a
                 couple crabs, right?


                 Yes, and can you pick some... are
                 you driving?


                 Yeah Ma.


                 You wearing your earpiece?

       Oscar hesitates for a beat.


                 Yeah...


                 Don't lie to me. That's all you
                 need is to get pulled over right
                 now. Put your earpiece on, Oscar.

       Oscar sighs... this is nothing new.





     Pink                                           12.



                 Hold on.

       He pulls the car over.

       He looks around for his earpiece for beat- no luck. He takes
       his cellphone, and slides it into the elastic of his beanie-
       a poor man's Bluetooth. He pulls off.


                 Hello?


                 It's on now?


                 Yeah Ma.


                 Okay pick up a couple of packets of
                 dried shrimp too. Come by on your
                 way, I'll give you the money.


                 Nah Ma, it's good.


                 Alright I'll pay you back tonight.


                 Ma, don't trip off that. I got you.

       Wanda pauses for a beat.


                 Okay, so you're buying this, with
                 Farmer Joe's money... right?


                 Ye-


                 Because that's the only kind of
                 money you have right now... right?





      Goldenrod                                       13.



                  Yeah Ma, and I'm gonna use my
                  discount.


                  Okay, well let me run in here. I'll
                  see you later tonight.


                  Love you.


                  Love you too.

        Wanda hangs up the phone. She looks at it for a beat. Then
        puts it back in her purse and heads into the warehouse.




        We see the entrance of Farmer Joe's, and shoppers coming in
        and out. Oscar looks around for a beat, and takes off his
        hoody, and puts it into his back pocket. We follow him into-




        It is a moderately sized grocery store, but several SHOPPERS
        move about the aisles. Oscar walks over to the seafood
        section where Cato CALDWELL, a 22 year old charismatic Black       
        male stands behind the counter wearing a Deli apron.

        Cato sees Oscar and smiles brightly. He takes a pile of fish       
        off the scale, bags it, ands it to an older BLACK WOMAN. He
        takes off his clear glove and slaps hands with Oscar over the
        counter.


                  Sup Osc, bruh?


                  Shit. What's good?


                  You lookin for Emi?


                  Yeah. He here today?


                  Hell yeah he is. He was just over
                  here...




     Goldenrod                                     13A.


       Cato looks around at the surrounding aisles. No signs of him.    


                 I came to get some crabs too.





     Goldenrod                                      14.



                 Oh yeah, tell Moms I said Happy
                 Birthday. I had meant to call her
                 this morning.


                 You should come through grandma
                 house tonight.


                 Bruh I wish I could, but I gotta
                 bust a couple moves tonight. What's
                 good for the countdown though?


                 Frisco. Fireworks and the whole
                 shit-

       Oscar sees something out of the corner of his eye. He motions
       his head for Cato to look. Cato turns and sees-                  

       KATIE, a White girl in her mid 20's, playing with her iPhone
       while waiting for help. Cato quickly makes his way over.         


                 You ready?


                 Uh, yeah... I want to get a pound
                 of, wait... Can I see what your
                 sole looks like?


                 Sole?

       Cato takes a sidestep over to his left and motions to a pile     
       of fish.


                 Yeah, no, wait. Your catfish. Let
                 me see what that looks like....

       Cato points to the catfish. Katie looks at it, then looks        
       down to her phone.


                 Okay but, I want to fry it. Like a
                 fish fry. Are these the ones you
                 can fry?

       Cato gives her an "are you serious?" look.                       





     Goldenrod                             14A.



                 Every fish we sell here can be
                 fried.





     Goldenrod                                       15.


       Katie looks at him, still flustered.


                 Okay, let me have a second.

       She looks back down at her iPhone, and takes a step back.
       Cato turns to Oscar.                                             


                 What you need for moms, bruh?


                 Let me get three Dungeness.

       Cato nods and walks over to the crab.                            


                 Fat ones too, bruh.


                 Bet.

       Oscar turns to Katie.


                 Your family having a fish fry for
                 New Years or something?

       Katie looks up from her phone, a bit caught off guard.


                 Ahh, yeah. Something like that.


                 It's cool. I work here.

       She looks at Oscar suspiciously.


                 It's my day off.

       Katie smiles nervously. Looks at Cato who nods at Katie in       
       approval.





     Green                                       16.



                 Oh, okay.
                     
                 Well, I'm cooking dinner tonight
                 for my friend, before we go to the
                 city. And he really likes fried
                 fish, like southern style. And I
                 maybe lied a bit, and said that I
                 know how to cook like that.

       Oscar laughs at this. Katie shakes her head.


                 Is he black?


                 What? Who?


                 Your boyfriend.

       Katie blushes.


                 He's white. But he knows a lot of
                 black people... He's not my
                 boyfriend either...

       Oscar chuckles at this.





     Pink                                              17.


       Katie looks down at her phone again. She uses her fingers to
       zoom in on something.


                 I'm not sure what type of fish he
                 wants. And most of these recipes
                 are different on this site.

       Oscar watches her with a look of pity. Suddenly, an idea
       flashes before his eyes.

       He pulls out his cellphone, quickly dials a number, and holds
       it to his ear.




       We see GRANDMA BONNIE, a black woman in her early 70's ,
       putting flowers into a vase on her kitchen counter.

       A cordless phone RINGS on the counter. She looks at the phone
       for a beat then she cheers up.


                     
                 Hello?



     Pink                                             18.




       Oscar holds his cellphone and snaps at Katie to get her
       attention.


                 Grandma...


                 Oscar? What's going on Baby?


                 I'm at my job, and this girl here-


                 You say you're at work?


                 Well, yeah....


                 Boy you know better than to be
                 talking on the phone while you're
                 at work! Bye!


                 Grandma, Grandma, I'm off today.
                 I'm just shopping for the party.


                 Oh, I thought you were up there
                 playing on the phone.


                 Naw grandma. But I got this girl
                 here, she wants to fry fish for her
                 boyfriend, but she don't know how.
                 You think you could tell her what
                 she needs to know and everything?





     Pink                                           19.



                 Oh no problem, baby. What kind of
                 fish does she want to fry?


                     
                 What type of F--, wait..
                     
                 She don't know.


                 What you mean she don't know? Put
                 her on the phone.


                     
                 Hold on.

       Oscar holds out the phone for Katie. She reaches out
       apprehensively. He gives her a reassuring look. She takes it.


                     
                 What's her name?


                     
                 Grandma Bonnie.





     Goldenrod                                      20.



                        
                    Hello, Grandma Bonnie, it's Katie,
                    Nice to meet you.

       Katie smiles and blocks her other ear to hear better.


                    Pssst!

       Oscar snaps his head to Cato, who motions for Oscar to look       
       down the aisle.

       Oscar looks over and sees, EMI, a thirtysomething Hispanic
       man wearing a white collared shirt and a name tag. He checks
       the shelves with a barcode scanning device.

       Oscar slowly heads over.


                    Good morning, Emi.


                    Oscar, what's going on??


                    Had to grab some stuff for my Mom's
                    birthday.


                    I hope you found everything that
                    you need.

       Emi turns and starts for the next aisle.


                    Emi, hold up man, I wanted to talk
                    to you.


                    It's a little nuts right now,
                    holiday and all. But what's up?

       Long beat.





     Pink                                           21.



                 I just want...
                     
                 I need my job back. I need my job
                 back.


                 Position's been filled. Take care
                 man.

       Emi turns to head down the aisle, Oscar reaches out and grabs
       Emi by his sleeve. Emi stops and turns around.


                 Look, I was going through some
                 shit, trying to get back on my
                 feet. But I need this job man. I'll
                 show up early every day. You can
                 start me back off with one shift a
                 week or whatever. I'm here. You can
                 work me 40 hours a week and pay me
                 for 20. I'm here.


                 Oscar, dude. I hired somebody else.
                 For me to hire you back, that means
                 I have to let someone else go.
                 Someone with no felonies. Who's
                 never showed up late once. I like
                 you man, but I can't do that. I'm
                 sorry. If something else opens up,
                 maybe I'll let you know. Take care
                 of yourself.

       Emi walks away. Oscar watches him.


                 Hey!

       Oscar turns around to find Katie, holding out his phone for
       him to take. Oscar looks at her basket, it's now full of fish
       and supplies.


                 You sure you got enough?


                 Oh my god, Your grandmother is so
                 sweet! I can't believe she was kind
                 enough to do that.


                 Trust me. She's happy to help.



     Goldenrod                                   22-24.



                 Thank you so much... Katie by the
                 way.

       She extends her hand to shake with Oscar. Oscar smiles,
       shakes it.


                 Oscar.


                 Oscar... like the Grouch!!

       Oscar shakes his head at this. Katie starts off towards the
       register.


                 Take care.

       Oscar's nods. He walks back over to Cato, who is weighing         
       fish for another CUSTOMER. He spots Oscar.


                 How it go?

       Oscar smiles wide and nods. He reaches over the counter and
       grabs the bag of crabs, then bumps fists with Cato.               


                 That's wussup bruh! Imma hit you
                 tonight! Yall can ride with me.

       Oscar nods and heads towards the checkout line, his smile
       fading.




       Oscar places the bag of crabs in the refrigerator. He closes
       it and looks at the refrigerator for a beat. On it we see
       several drawings done by Tatiana held on the door by magnets.

       Oscar smiles at these. His phone rings: BIG SIS CALLING



     Green                                           25.




       Chantay, a 25 year old Black woman, wearing a KFC employee
       uniform pinches a cellphone between her ear and her shoulder.
       She organizes papers in a folder while she talks into the
       phone.


                 Hey, chump! What you doin?


                 At the house, just got back from
                 the job.


                 I thought you were off today.


                 I am.


                 Oh... You call mom yet?


                 Yup.


                 Oh okay. I got good news and bad
                 news.

       Oscar thinks for a bit.


                 Bad news first.


                 I need help with the rent for this
                 month.


                 How much?


                 Like $300. I'll get you back in a
                 couple of weeks.


                 Okay. What's the good news.


                 I'm working overtime tonight.





     Green                                          25A.



                 What? That's fucking bad news too.


                 No it's not. Double time and a
                 half.


                 C'mon Chantay.


                 Hey, gotta do it. Moms understands.
                 But I need you to get her a card
                 and sign it for me.


                 Aight.


                 And Osc, don't get me a fake ass
                 card with white people on it. I
                 want a black card. And not one of
                 those joke cards either.


                 Aight. I got you.


                 Thank you Oscar, love you.


                 Love you too, scrub.


                 Bye.

       Oscar closes his phone. Thinks to himself for a beat. He
       opens his phone back up and punches some numbers. Calling
       Marcus flashes across the screen.







       MARCUS, a tough looking Asian- American man about Oscar's age
       sits in a barber's chair, A Black BARBER cuts his hair. His
       phone vibrates in his pocket, and the Barber steps back to
       let him answer it. He pulls out an iPhone and talks into it.


                 Wussup wit it, Osc?



     Green                                   25B.



                 Wussup bruh? My bad about last
                 night. You still tryna get that?


                 Yeah, but I aint out that way. Imma
                 be in the Town all day.

       Oscar takes a beat.


                 Shit bruh I can come to you.


                 Okay... Meet me over there by the
                 water bruh. Right off of 80. I'll
                 be over there in like a hour.


                 Aight, bet.


                 Bet.

       Oscar hangs up his phone.
     Green                                            26.




       Oscar quickly walks over to his closet and grabs the bag of
       weed. He neatens up the room a bit, and takes off.




       The store is small and brightly lit. Oscar is reading a card
       from off the BIRTHDAY FOR MOTHER rack.

       We see that on the card is a picture of a black woman walking
       on the beach holding her son's hand. Inscribed over it are
       the words to the religious poem "Footsteps" by Anonymous.

       Oscar's eyes quickly scan the poem: he's read it before.
       Oscar opens the card, and looks inside for a beat. He looks
       up, moved by the words. He stares off into space.





       We look through a foggy window at Wanda sitting at one of
       several large wooden tables with plastic chairs placed around
       them. There are a few VISITORS already sitting at tables with
       inmates. Several Corrections Officers stand by.

       We see Oscar, shirtless, arms behind his head, is looking
       through the glass window of the search room. A Corrections
       Officer is conducting a search. Oscar's face is bruised under
       his left eye, and there is a small white bandage strip on the
       left side of his face. He turns around, bends over and
       coughs. He turns back around, and the officer hands him his
       Blue shirt and pants. Oscar puts them on and-

       BUZZ. The door opens, and Oscar walks through the large room
       to Wanda's table. As he approaches she stands up.


                 Hey Ma.

       Oscar gives her a hug, leaning across the table.





     Green                                   27.



                 What happened to your face?


                 You look nice.

       Wanda shakes her head.


                 My girls come over last night?

       Wanda nods. Laughs a bit.


                 We played board games.


                 "Candyland"?

       Wanda nods. Laughing a bit more now.


                 Yall let her win too, I bet.


                 Of course.





     Blue                                           28.



                 Yall hella weak for that. She gets
                 no easy victories with me around.

       Oscar smiles and notices Wanda is smiling about something on
       her mind.


                 What?


                 Do you remember that microwave
                 popcorn you bought a while back?


                 Yeah, the kettle corn. Hella good.


                 Yes, kettle corn. I popped some of
                 that for us, and I was putting it
                 into a bowl. Tatiana's looking up
                 at me, like she wants something.

       Wanda starts to chuckle a bit again.


                 C'mon. What she say?


                 She looks up at me and
                 says,"Grandma, do we have any dark
                 butter?"

       Oscar looks at Wanda with a confused look.


                 Dark butter?


                 Yeah, I'm thinking she saw "Food
                 Network" or something. So I say,
                 "what's dark butter sweetheart?"
                 She says, "When Daddy took me to
                 see WALL.E he asked for light
                 butter, so I want to try some dark
                 butter this time."

       Oscar looks at Wanda with a bright eyed expression.


                 She is gettin way too smart.

       Another BUZZ from the door is heard.



     Green                                           29.


       As the two share a moment, DANIEL CALE, a stocky white inmate
       in his early 30's walks past Oscar and Wanda's table. He has
       a large, square bandage under his left eye.


                     (just loud enough for
                      Oscar to hear)
                 This moms right here?

       Anger flashes over Oscar's eyes.


                 She a snitch to?


                 What? What the Fuck you say about
                 my Mom bruh?


                 Oscar!


                 Fuck you and that bitch.


                 You tough in here with these guards
                 huh?

       Two Corrections Officers move quickly over to Oscar's table.
       Cale, continues to walk towards a the table with the Woman
       and the Frizzy Haired Girl.


                 Is there a problem here?


                 Naw, we good.


                 That's my best friend right there.

       Cale flashes a mischievous smile.

       The Corrections Officer comes over and stands between the
       two.

       Oscar watches as Cale sits down across from the woman, who
       holds the baby. Cale smiles at the woman, and makes coochie
       coo faces at the baby.





     Green                                          30.


       Woman passes the child to Cale over the table.

       Oscar looks on with malice.


                 Oscar, Calm down.

       Wanda's voice snaps the anger off of his face.

       He looks back to Wanda, and his anger subsides.


                 What happened to your face?


                 Dark butter huh? She always
                 listening.

       Wanda stares at Oscar.


                 She too smart for her own good man.
                 The preschool said we should think
                 about starting her in school early.
                 Phina tell you that?

       Wanda doesn't respond.


                 Yeah, we're gonna put her in
                 private school. I was lookin at St.
                 Bede the other day. It's this other
                 school that starts them off
                 learning Spanish, then it gradually
                 gets them back going on English.
                 It's like a new thing-


                 I'm not coming to see you anymore.

       Oscar stops in his tracks.


                 What you mean?


                 I'm not coming here, to these
                 visits anymore. This is the last
                 time.





     Goldenrod                                   31.



                 I know I know I know. This is my
                 last time too. I told you that. I
                 ain't goin down no more.                             


                 You want to keep putting Sophina
                 through this... go ahead. But
                 Tatiana doesn't deserve this. She
                 didn't have a choice.

       Oscar takes this in.


                 She too young to know what's going
                 on right now.


                 I guess that's why she asked me why
                 you love taking your vacations more
                 than being with her.

       Oscar cut his eyes from Wanda.


                 She aint say that.


                 So I'm the liar now.

       Oscar takes a beat to think about this.


                 Tell her that I love her more than
                 anything in the world. And that I-





     Green                                           32.



                 Tell her yourself. Next time you
                 call. Tell your daughter how much
                 you love her over the phone. Or
                 better yet, just let her come visit
                 you?


                 I don't want her to see me like
                 this.


                 Like what?


                 In a box.


                 But this is how you are right now.


                 I don't want her to be exposed to
                 this.


                 You've already exposed her to it!

       Wanda leans back in her chair- she's done.


                 So you really not gonna visit me no
                 more? I got four more months!!

       Oscar leans in.


                     
                 Ma, this shit aint like Rita. It's
                 crazy in here. I don't know if I
                 can make it without you seeing you
                 that long.


                 I love you Oscar, I'm praying for
                 you, and I'll see you when you get
                 home.

       Wanda scoots back in her chair, stands up, and heads towards
       the exit.





     Green                                              33.


       Oscar remains seated in his chair.


                 Ma, hold up. Let me get a hug.

       Wanda continues to walk. Oscar stands up, and follows behind
       Wanda. His feet pass a yellow line.


                 Ma!

       Wanda continues on, not turning around.


                 Ma! Hold up!

       The C.O. sees this.


                 Grant, back in your assigned
                 visiting area.

       Oscar ignores him, and continues to follow his Mom.

       The C.O. hits a button on his walkie, and motions to the
       other C.O.'s. They quickly move towards Oscar and attempt to
       grab him.


                 Get the fuck off me!

       Oscar jerks away.


                 Ma!

       The C.O.'s grab Oscar and lift him up off of the ground.


                 Get off me! Ma! Ma!

       Wanda continues on.





     Green                                           34.






                 Ma. Ma! Hold up!
                     
                 Let me just give her a hug right
                 quick before she leave!

       We pull back with Wanda as she walks away, trying to hide her
       pain. Another Corrections Officer sprints past her towards
       Oscar, who we can still see in the distance.


                 Ma! Ma!
                     
                 Get the fuck off me!
                     
                 Ma! Ma!

       Oscar looks on at Wanda as she leaves, growing small in the
       distance.




       Oscar still stares off into space, moved by this memory. He
       snaps out of it, heads towards the register with the cards in
       hand.




       Oscar starts the car up, looks at his dashboard. He sees that
       the fuel light is on.
     Pink                                       35-35A.




       Oscar pumps his gas. He looks at a poster of Obama that reads
       CHANGE, posted on the gas pump. He looks across the lot and
       notices a Zales engagement ring poster.

       He pulls out his phone. Starts to text.





       He sends it off. Closes, waits for a bit. It buzzes. He opens
       it.




       Oscar puts his phone back into his pocket. He turns and
       begins to pump his gas. He sets the handle to automatically
       pump, and looks up and notices something.





     Pink                                           36.


       We see it is a gnarly- looking male PIT BULL sniffing around
       a few feet from Oscar's tires. It looks to be maybe 3 or 4
       years old. Oscar whistles at the dog and calls him over.

       Oscar pets him on the head, we see its ears are a bit
       scarred, but it has beautiful brown eyes. He feels around the
       dog's neck- no collar. Oscar looks around for an owner for a
       beat while the dog licks his hand.

       CLICK- Oscar's gas tank is full. He turns away from the dog,
       places the pump back on the base, and screws his fuel cap
       back in. He looks back to where the dog was and doesn't see
       him. He scans the block and panic strikes his face. He takes
       off running towards the street.


                 Shit! No, No, No Stop!

       SCHREECH... BAM! We hear it before we see it. A sickening
       sound. An animal YELPS, a car SPEEDS OFF. Oscar runs into the
       street chasing a car going too fast for us to see.


                     
                 Hey! Stop you bitch ass
                 Muthafucka!!

       He stops, turns around, and runs over to something lying in
       the street. It's the dog, and he's in bad shape. Oscar picks
       the dog up out of the street, and places him on the sidewalk.


                     
                 Come'on boy. Come on.

       The dog's breathing grows more struggled.


                     
                 Shit.
                     
                 Somebody help! Somebody fucking
                 Help!





     Pink                                           37.


       Oscar continues to pet his head. The dog starts to violently
       shake...

       He becomes unnaturally still.

       Oscar stares at the Dog for a long beat, shaken up by this.
       He looks around, no one seems to have noticed.

       He bends down, closes the Dog's eyes, and heads for his car.




       It is an empty parking lot next to a beautiful view of the
       Bay. Oscar's car pulls up. After a short beat. A Lexus pulls
       up along side of it. Marcus hops out of the Lexus and walks
       over to Oscar's car.




       Oscar leans over and opens the passenger side door for Marcus
       to get in.


                 Shit bruh I didn't think we was
                 ever gonna link up. You been good?

       Oscar stares out of the window.


                 I got good news and bad news my
                 nigg.


                 Awww naw, Osc bruh, don't tell me
                 you aint got it.


                 Sold it to a white boy bruh.


                 Awww Osc. For how much?


                 Gave me a rack for it.

       Marcus makes a face.





     Green                                           38.



                 No way I was goin that high. Shit
                 bruh. I needed that though...
                 What's the good news?

       Oscar turns to Marcus hands him a brown pre- rolled joint.


                 For your troubles.


                 Right on Osc bruh.

       He pulls out a wad of money.


                 It's good bruh. Take it.


                 You sure?

       Oscar nods.


                 Right on bruh.

       Marcus pulls out a lighter.


                 Burn one with ya boy right quick.

       Marcus lights up the joint, takes a hit, holds it out for
       Oscar, but Oscar just stares out of the Window.


                 I'm good, that's all you bruh.

       Marcus puts it back into his mouth.


                 Right on Osc, then bruh.

       They slap hands, and Marcus gets out of the car. We hear him
       get into his car, and start his car up. Oscar waits for a
       beat. He then reaches under his seat and grabs something.




       Oscar walks out onto the shoreline, looking at the water. He
       looks around for a beat. He walks all the way out into the
       water. Standing on rocks.




     Green                                          38A.


       He looks over both shoulders, to make sure no one is
       watching. He then goes into his waistband and pulls out the
       Ziplock bag of weed. He squats down, opens the bag, and dumps
       it into the water. He watches as the green buds float off.




       Oscar walks up to the heavily crowded store entrance. We see
       Sophina exiting holding a large cardboard cake box. Oscar
       takes it from her.





      Goldenrod                              39.



                  What flavor did you get.


                  Carrot cake.

        Oscar looks at the cake box.


                  Why you didn't get ice cream?


                  Cause it aint your birthday nigga.


                  Can you take me by my grandma's
                  house so I can get changed?


                  Yeah. You know it would be hella
                  easier if you just had your stuff
                  at my spot right. When you gonna
                  move in.


                  Probably when you stop having trees
                  in the car before we pick up T.


        She gets into the car.






     Pink                                          39A.





       We follow Oscar as he turns the corner into a backyard full
       of toys and KIDS Tatiana's age. Mrs. Stacey watches them,
       smiling, but with vigilant eyes. Tatiana spots Oscar and runs
       up and gives him a hug.

       Oscar waves and smiles at Mrs. Stacey, who waves back. He
       walks over to the sign out sheet and grabs a pen.





     Pink                                         40-40A.



                 We played "Freeze Tag" today.


                 Oh yeah?


                 They couldn't catch me.

       Oscar looks up from the sign in sheet.


                 You think you're faster than daddy?

       Tatiana looks back at Oscar challengingly. Oscar looks at
       something behind Tatiana with concern.


                 What's that right there?

       Tatiana takes the bait- the oldest trick in the book. Oscar
       takes off.




       Oscar is beating Tatiana to the car by a mile. Tatiana
       follows him laughing loudly.


                 You cheated!




       A small television sits next to the stove playing a
       Telenovella.

       Looking at the episode from the kitchen doorway is MARIANA
       PANGELINA, Sophina's 65 year old grandmother. SIZZLING can be
       heard coming from the kitchen. The front door opens, and in
       walks Sophina, Oscar, and Tatiana.


                 Bisabuella!


                 Hola Tatiana!

       Tatiana runs to Mariana and gives her a hug.

       Oscar gives her a kiss on the cheek. Sophina gives her a hug.
       The three take a seat at the kitchen table.



     Green                                           41.


       Mariana continues to cook.


                 Grandma, can you watch T tonight?
                 We gonna go to Frisco.

       Mariana shakes her head.


                 Ask your sister.


                 But Rose got hella kids to watch.


                 But what's the difference between
                 watching six kids, and watching
                 seven?

       Sophina think about this.


                     
                 Quieres pasar la noche con sus
                 primos?

       Tatiana nods. Sophina sighs, pulls out her cell phone, and
       heads out of the kitchen. Mariana turns to Oscar.





     Green                                           41A.



                     
                 How's work?


                 You know... it's work.


                 Hmm.

       Oscar thinks on this, exits the kitchen in the direction of
       Sophina. Only Tatiana is left at the table. Mariana smiles.
       At her. She puts some pollo on a fork, and takes it over to
       her.




       As Oscar enters, we see Sophina is in her bra and panties,
       talking into her cellphone. She lays several different
       outfits out on the bed. Oscar closes the bedroom door, leans
       on it.


                     
                 Alright... We'll be through there
                 at like 10..

       She hangs up her phone, and tosses it on the bed.


                 Rose gonna watch T.

       She looks through the clothes on her bed and lifts up a
       checkered hoodie, puts it to her chest. Looks at herself in a
       full body mirror, sighs at her reflection.


                 What you think?


                     
                 It's cool.





     Green                                           42.


       Sophina turns around and looks at Oscar, senses something is
       eating at him. She puts the hoodie down, and walks over to
       him.


                 You okay? You been hella weird
                 today.


                 Naw, I'm smooth. Just a little
                 tired.

       Sophina's not buying it.


                 Osc. Wussup?

       Oscar looks at her for a beat. Cuts his eyes.


                     
                 Fuck it.
                     
                 I lost my job.

       Sophina looks at him like he's speaking another language...
       for a long beat.


                 What the fuck you mean? Did they
                 lay you off?

       Oscar doesn't say anything.


                 They doing cutbacks or some shit?


                 I got fired.


                 For what?


                 Showin up late. Missed a couple
                 days when I had to get some money.


                 They told you today?

       Oscar waits a beat.





     Green                                       43.



                 Keep it real, they fired me two
                 weeks ago.

       Sophina's eyes get as wide as quarters.


                 My bad-


                 Don't fucking my bad me Osc! What
                 was you doin when you was
                 pretending to go to work? You know
                 what? I don't even want to know.


                 I thought I was gonna be able to
                 get my shit back.

       Sophina looks at him and shakes her head.


                     
                 You think life a fucking joke...
                 You think you're gonna get fired
                 and then somebody is gona give you
                 thier job back? What world do you
                 live in?


                 Phina,


                 You aint shit, you know that? You
                 lie to me, you lie to your fucking
                 daughter. You don't give a fuck
                 about us.


                 I didn't have to tell you shit.





     Green                                        44.





                 So you would have just kept faking
                 like you were going to work? And
                 would have just been out bustin
                 nocks? And doing whatever else, or
                 WHOEVER else you do while I'm at
                 work?


                 I thought you wanted the truth...
                 But you ain't trying to hear that.

       Sophina doesn't know what to say to this.


                 I want you to be honest with me.
                 But off top. From the fucking jump.
                 Not after you lie for two weeks get
                 cornered, and don't have a choice.
                     
                 What did you today. Hmm. I bet you
                 sold that fucking zip.


                 I dumped it. I'm done with that
                 shit. I'm tired. That's what I'm
                 trying to tell you. Thought I could
                 start fresh today. But that shit
                 aint working out.

       A long beat.


                 You threw it away?

       Oscar nods.





     Green                                           45.



                  You tossed a whole zip of weed. And
                  you don't have a job.

       Oscar doesn't say anything. He smiles at this.


                  Oh my God I could slap you right
                  now.

       Sophina hugs him, he doesn't resist this time. Hugs her back.


                  What are you gonna do?


                  I don't know? Something legal.
                  Gonna see if my sister can hire me
                  again, while I look. Maybe if I can
                  just not fuck up, for 30 days..
                  Oprah said that's all it takes to
                  form a habit, right?

       Sophina laughs, Oscar kisses her.


                  Look at me.

       Oscar looks at her closely.


                  You really done with that shit?

       He nods.


                  You better be. Don't make me have
                  to do this shit alone, again. I
                  don't know if I can.

       Oscar kisses her neck. Sophina reaches back and unhooks her
       bra. Oscar kisses her face, picks her up.
     Blue                                          45A.




       Mariana and Tatiana sit side by side at the table, spellbound
       by the Telenovella.
     Pink                                        46-48.




       Oscar, with Tatiana sitting on his shoulders, and a bag of
       crabs in his hand, walks up to the porch of a modest house.
       Sophina stands at his side holding a cake. Oscar uses his key
       to open the door.




       The three enter the house and walk through the house into the
       kitchen.

       Wanda, wearing casual clothes now, fills up a pot with water.
       Grandma Bonnie washes a basin full of vegetables.


                 Happy Birthday!

       Oscar takes Tatiana off her shoulders and sits her down.
       Everyone greets each other.


                 Hey baby. You guys are just in
                 time.

       Oscar sits the crabs down on the counter next to the sink. He
       gives his mother a big bear hug. She smiles, hugs him back
       just as tight. Oscar lets go and moves on to his grandmother.

       Sophina and Tatiana come give Wanda hugs.


                 Oh my god, you guys got a cake too?

       Sophina blushes.

       Everyone laughs at this... even Ceephus.

       Wanda and Grandma Bonnie begin to take the groceries out of
       the plastic bag. Wanda pulls out two massive crabs. Looks in
       the bag and sees the third.


                 Osc. You know all I needed was two,
                 you didn't have to spend so much
                 money.


                 Don't trip, it wasn't that much.

       Oscar turns from the kitchen into the den.
     Pink                                          49.




       Two men in their 50's sit down on the couch across from a TV
       playing ESPN. These are Oscar's uncles DARYL and CEEPHUS
       JOHNSON. Oscar walks over to a recliner adjacent to them and
       pulls the Hallmark Bag out of his waistband. He sits down in
       the recliner and signs his Mom's card.


                 Who you goin for in the Super Bowl
                 Unc?

       Oscar watches, and waits for them to take the bait.


                 Steelers.

       Daryl shakes his head at this.


                 A Raiders fan, cheering for the
                 Steelers.


                 Black uniforms, black players,
                 black coach. Coach even has a black
                 wife. I'm going with the Steelers.





     Pink                                             50.



                 You're insane, you know that?

       Oscar cracks up at this.







       Wanda and Sophina clean the crab with brushes and different
       utensils. Grandma Bonnie starts up a roux in a large skillet.

       Uncle Daryl makes a large pitcher of lemonade from
       concentrate. Sophina and Oscar pull out glasses, dishes, and
       utensils for everyone. Tatiana watches Oscar closely.





     Green                                           51.


       A large pot is placed atop the gas stove. The burner blazes
       under it, as Wanda drops the now clean crabs into the bucket.

       She drops in the vegetables and begins to stir. Bowls are
       grabbed by everyone and they are filled up by Wanda, with
       white rice first, and then the brown gumbo is poured over it,
       along with large pieces of un- cracked crab.

       Everyone eats their gumbo in the kitchen. Laughing talking.
       Wanda blows out the candles on her cake, cuts it, Hands out
       everyone a slice.







       Everyone is finishing up their cake, it's about half gone
       now. Oscar sits on the couch between Wanda and Sophina.

       Ceephus and Daryl now sit in plush chairs with metal frames
       pulled up next to the coffee table. Grandma Bonnie sits in a
       recliner at the foot of the coffee table.


                 If somebody told me say twenty
                 years ago, that I would live to see
                 it happen, I'd have laughed in
                 their face.


                 If somebody would have told me that
                 two years ago I would have laughed
                 in their face.


                 And here we are. 2008 and its
                 happened.





     Pink                                        52.



                 But I think it's a sign of the
                 times. The country is in bad enough
                 shape for them to hand it over to a
                 black guy. Look, if Bush hadn't
                 have messed the country up so bad.
                 Would he have even had a shot?


                 I think he still would have had a
                 shot.


                 But would he have won though?


                 Well, I'm happy the did win. If the
                 country really is as messed up as
                 you say, I think he's our best
                 chance of fixing it.





     Pink                                        53.



                 I keep thinking about how much it
                 means for T.


                 When I was coming up, Teachers used
                 to love to tell me, "You can be the
                 President of the United States."


                 You'd make a great politician. You
                 can talk your way out of anything.

       Sophina and Oscar share a look.


                 But I'll never forget, in my fourth
                 grade classroom we had this poster.
                 It had all 40 some odd presidents
                 on that thang. And I looked at all
                 they faces. And it was all white
                 dudes. At that point, I realized my
                 teachers was lying to me.
                     
                 A part of me aint believed what no
                 teacher has said to me since.


                 Now there will be a black face on
                 those posters.





     Pink                                           54.



                 Well let's let him get in there
                 first.


                 I know, I still feel like it's just
                 too good to be true.


                 What's so good about it?


                 A black man, one of us has been
                 elected president, fair and square.

       Ceephus shakes his head at this.


                 But he's not one of us. He wasn't
                 affected by slavery.

       Wanda has had enough of this. She stands up and starts to
       grab everyone's plates. She heads into the kitchen to wash.
       Oscar watches her for a beat, then follows after her.
     Goldenrod                                      55.




       Wanda stands over the sink washing the dishes. Oscar stands
       next to her, drying them.                                        


                 Thanks for your help tonight.

                                                                        


                 Oh, Come'on Ma, don't mention it.
                 You shouldn't even be doing this.


                 I enjoy washing dishes. It's
                 relaxing.





     Goldenrod                                      56.


       Oscar rolls his eyes at this. She hands him another dish.


                 I really enjoyed having you here.
                     
                 You think it's safe for me to get
                 used to having you around?


                 I told you. I aint missin no more
                 parties.

       She looks at Oscar for a long beat, searching for the truth
       in his eyes. She finds it.


                 You guys got plans for tonight?


                 Yeah, nothing major. Gonna meet up
                 with Cato, Jack, Jason and couple                      
                 other cats. Head out to the City.


                 You guys gonna go OUT OUT?


                 Naw. We gonna keep it low key.
                 Probably just catch the fireworks,
                 and then roll around after that.


                 Roll around?


                 Yeah, just chill, we'll be cool.
                 Sophina's got work in the morning
                 too.


                 You guys gonna be drinking?





     Goldenrod                                      57.



                 I'm sure they will. I'm not gonna
                 be drinking.

       Wanda looks at Oscar, not buying it. Oscar laughs.


                 Why don't you catch BART out there?
                 That way you can drink and hang
                 out, and not have to worry about
                 anything.


                 Yeah we might catch BART.


                 No traffic either. You know its
                 gonna be crazy. Going and coming
                 back.


                 Yeah, we might have to do it.


                 Promise me, if you and your friends
                 go, you'll catch the train.
                     
                 I'm serious.


                 Okay, I promise.


                 Aight. Don't make me follow you
                 guys to make sure... you remember
                 Prom.

       Oscar laughs at this so hard he has to sit the bowl. He pulls
       out his phone and starts to text.


                 Let's catch BART out there. Tell
                 everybody to meet at South Hayward
                 Station.

       He presses send. He picks the dish back up, and dries it. His
       phone buzzes. He look at it.


                 Aight bet. We'll see you there in
                 minute.
     Pink                                           58.




       Oscar, Sophina, and Tatiana say their good-byes to Grandma
       Bonnie, and Uncle Daryl and Uncle Ceephus.

       Oscar walks up to Wanda.


                 Alright we out, Birthday Girl. Love
                 you.


                 Love you too, son. And Happy New
                 Year.

       Oscar gives her a big hug and kiss, then turns and leads his
       family out of the door. Wanda watches them, and shuts the
       door behind him.




       Oscar drives through Hayward in silence, turning his wheels.
       Tatiana watches out of the backseat passenger window with a
       solemn expression.

       She looks up at a bright flash of light in the sky. We see
       outside her window, a group of YOUNG TEENAGERS stand on a
       street corner and shoot off a Roman Candle.







       Oscar and Sophina sit in the front seat of the car. They both
       look tired. They look back at Tatiana who continues to
       lookout of the window.


                     
                 You don't want to just call it a
                 night?

       Sophina thinks about this. Shakes her head.


                     
                 I want to go to the city... It's
                 been a minute since we been out
                 together too.




     Pink                                            59.



                 Alright.

       They both get out of the car. Oscar grabs Tatiana and walks
       up to the house. He rings the doorbell.




       ROSE, Sophina's 27 year old sister, sits on the couch in
       front of a small television. She wears sweatpants and a pink
       T shirt.

       Sprawled out a pallate of blankets and pillows on the carpet
       are Rose's kids,  twins
       Eilly and Angelo .

       The doorbell rings, and Rose gets up off of the couch and
       opens up the door.

       Oscar bursts into the living room.


                 Happy New Year!!!! ARRRGHHHH!!!


                 Uncle Oscar!!!!!

       Rose's kids all jump up and growl back, mobbing Oscar, all
       smiles, clawing at his pants.


                 You gonna sleep over uncle Oscar?

       Oscar smiles at this, and shakes his head.


                 Pleeeaaaase mommy can Uncle Oscar
                 spend the night?

       Oscar struggles for a bit, laughing, Tatiana jumps into the
       fray, helping her cousins tackle her Dad. Oscar, gives up,
       laughing, and falls to the carpet.

       Rose and Sophina look on at this. Sophina laughs, Rose
       doesn't.


                 C'mon Osc, I just got them ready
                 for bed...





     Pink                                     59aA.



                 Ok, ok, ok. My bad. Stop you guys.
                 Time out.





     Pink                                          59A.



                 You guys let your uncle up.

       The kids ease up on Oscar a bit. Oscar sits up, and looks at
       Tatiana.





     Pink                                              60.



                 Let's brush those teeth.


                 No!

       She backs up smiling, and laughing.


                 You want your teeth to rot? And
                 your breath to smell like gumbo?


                 Yes!

       Oscar looks at her seriously.


                 No you don't. Because then- THE


       Oscar quickly moves in for the attack. Tickling Tatiana and
       picking her up. Rose's Kids laugh and follow Oscar towards-




       It is a modest bathroom. Oscar sits Tatiana on a wooden stool
       in front of the sink.

       Tatiana gets ready to place the toothbrush into her mouth but
       stops. She looks up at Oscar.


                 What?


                 You had gumbo, too.

       Oscar looks back at Tatiana guiltily.






       Both Tatiana and Oscar stand side by side brushing their
       teeth, smiling while brushing. Oscar uses his finger.
     Pink                                           61.




       Oscar puts Tatiana into her pajamas. Sophina stands in the
       doorway watching them.


                 You guys aren't gonna sleep over
                 too?


                 Me and Mommy are gonna go see some
                 friends for a little bit. We'll be
                 right back.


                 But I don't want you to go.


                 We'll be back, in a few hours I
                 promise.


                 But you should go to bed. You
                 already brushed your teeth.
                 Remember?


                 I know, I know. But me and Mommy
                 promised our friends we would go
                 and visit them. We'll be back
                 before you wake up, okay?

       Oscar leans over and gives Tatiana a kiss on the cheek. He
       gets up and gets ready to leave.


                 Nooo! Don't go.

       She grabs his arm. Tears well up in her eyes.


                 I'm scared.


                 Scared of what?


                 I hear guns outside.


                 Those are just firecrakers. You'll
                 be safe inside.




     Pink                                        62.



                 But what about you daddy?


                 I'll be just fine. I'll tell you
                 what, tomorrow when we wake up,
                 we'll play "Candyland". And then
                 guess what we can do after that?


                 Go to the park?


                 Better.


                 "Toys R Us?"


                 Better than that.


                 What?


                 Chuck e Cheese's.

       Tatiana cracks a gigantic smile.


                 Really?


                 I promise. We'll play all the
                 games. And daddy's gonna give you
                 lots of tokens okay?


                 Okay.


                 And me and you are gonna eat up all
                 the pizza okay? We're gonna even
                 eat mommy's pizza because she can't
                 have carbs.


                 What's a carb?


                 Don't worry about that.

       Oscar stands up.



     Pink                                      62A.



                 I'm gonna head out now baby, okay?

       Tatiana pouts.


                 You don't want to go in there with
                 your cousins?





     Pink                                           63.


       Tatiana shakes her head, still not happy about Oscar leaving.


                 I love you.

       He kisses her on the cheek.


                 Love you too Daddy.

       Oscar and Sophina leave the room. We hear them say bye to
       Rose.








     Goldenrod                                        64.







       We follow Oscar and Sophina as they approach a tough looking
       group of 20 somethings. Among the group is Cato, Jason GREER,       
       KRIS RAFFERTY, Brandon and Tim BRYSON, CARLOS REYES, and            


       Oscar approaches the group and greets everyone.


                 Yall ready?

       The group starts walking towards the BART turnstiles. Talking
       as they walk. Jason leans in and whispers to Cato.                  


                 I can't believe these niggas
                 brought they broads. Finna be hella
                 work in Frisco tonight.

       Vanessa takes a Tea Bottle from Carlos, her boyfriend.


                 You gonna slow down? I'm not
                 dragging your drunk ass all over
                 Frisco.





     Goldenrod                                   65.


       Brandon leans in to Kris and Tim.                              


                 Two Thousand Nine... don't even
                 sound right bruh. But Twenty Ten?
                 Twenty Ten is the year my nigga. We
                 gettin it in, for Twenty Ten. See?
                 Don't nothing even rhyme with Two
                 Thousand Nine.

       Tim shakes his head.                                           


                 What you said just rhymed, you dumb
                 ass nigga!


                 Man fuck that. I'm boycottin 2009
                 bruh. Come twelve o' clock it's
                 officially Twenty- Ten. We "gettin
                 it in" in Twenty- Ten.

       Kris thinks about this.


                 What about Twenty Twenty though?
                 That shit hard as fuck. Two
                 twenties. We "gettin' plenty" in
                 twenty twenty.


                 But that's skippin too many years
                 bruh. You can't skip a whole
                 decade.

       Brandon turns to Oscar.                                        





     Goldenrod                                        66.



                 Osc, Osc! Take a shot with ya bruh
                 for the New Year.

       Oscar smiles, takes it. Drinks a small shot, and hands it
       back to Brandon. Brandon lifts the bottle up at Oscar like a      
       toast.


                 To Twenty- Ten.

       He takes a quick swig. Oscar gives Brandon a "What the fuck       
       are you talking about" look. The group laughs at this, and
       follow Oscar's lead towards the station entrance.




       The group enters through the turnstiles, sticking their
       tickets in and retrieving them as they pass through.

       They head up the stairs towards the platform.




       The San Francisco bound train is docked and a few passengers
       are still getting on to it.


                 Please stand clear, doors closing.

       Oscar runs up and stops the doors just as they are about to
       close. He holds it while the rest of the group boards.
     Goldenrod                                       67.




       Oscar boards, the doors close, and the train takes off. He
       looks around and sees the car is packed with COMMUTERS. He
       moves through the crowd to the back of the car he pulls open
       the doors and the group enters-




       Oscar looks around and heads over to some standing room next
       to where DANAE a gorgeous Black woman in her late 20's sits
       wearing a ball gown and leather jacket.

       Across from her sit KAREN and DONALD, a White couple dressed
       in similar clothing. There is an empty seat next to Danae,
       but Oscar, Sophina, Tim, Kris, Vanessa, and Carlos all remain      
       standing. Brandon, however, slides into the empty seat. He         
       puts his arm around Danae's seat.


                 Make sure you keep your hands to
                 yourself...

       The group laughs at this. Danae turns and looks at Brandon,        
       who is making a funny face at her. She can't hold in her
       smile.

       Brandon takes his arm down and offers her the bottle of            
       Hennessy- she declines. He turns to Karen and Donald, and
       offers it. Donald opens his jacket and pulls out a flask. He
       lifts it at Brandon, smiling. Brandon lifts his bottle in          
       return. The both take a swig.




       The BART train zooms by above street traffic.




       A few seats down from Oscar. Jason and Cato have found some        
       company. LAUREN and ASHAE two super attractive Black girls in
       their 20's sit next to each other. They pass a "Black and
       Mild" cigar back and forth.

       Cato and Jason hold onto the rails standing over them. Cato        
       takes his joint from behind his ear, lights it.


                 You know it's illegal to smoke
                 "Blacks" on BART right?



     Goldenrod                                         68.



                     
                 Is that right officer?

       Cato passes the lit joint to Jason.                                


                 But its cool. We'll let you slide
                 cause its New Years and all.

       Ashae looks up at Jason.                                           


                 I like your dreads.

       Jason passes her the joint. She takes it, puts her to her          
       lips.


                 I like your everything. We should
                 work something out.

       Ashae smiles and shakes her head as she takes a drag in.
       Lauren laughs.


                 We gay.

       Cato looks at them for a beat. He puts his arm around Jason.       


                 Shit, we gay too. We can do the
                 whole gay thing together.


                 Collaboration... It'll be fun.

       Lauren and Ashae laugh at this. Not buying it for a second.


                 Yall not gay.


                 Real shit... watch...

       Cato turns to Oscar, who is hugged up with Sophina.                


                     
                 Osc!! Osc my nigga!!!
                                                        
                 Aint we gay?




     Goldenrod                                      69.



                     
                 Yall niggas is Gay as Fuck!

       Everyone on the train laughs at this. Cato turns back to the     
       girls.


                 See?


                 Now approaching... West Oakland
                 Station.

       The standing passengers brace themselves, as the train slows
       to a stop.


                 Sorry folks, there's gonnna be a
                 slight delay while we sort out an
                 issue with this other train.

       Hands open connecting car doors from the other side,
       revealing DARIUS, a tough looking Back teenager wearing a
       hoodie and a colorful backpack. He is followed by two other
       BLACK TEENAGERS- his friends. Darius makes eye contact with
       Oscar for a long beat... lifts his head.

       Oscar lifts his head back, and looks down at his phone: It
       reads 11:55pm.


                 We gon miss the countdown bruh.


                 We aint gonna miss shit, we can get
                 it poppin right here.

       He presses a few buttons on his iPhone. It plays the MAC DRE
       song "FEELIN MYSELF" he turns it up. Oscar's friends nod
       their heads to the music.

       Darius' face brightens up and he takes off his backpack, He
       digs in it.


                 Wait, bruh.

       He pulls some laptop speakers out of his bag, leans over
       Danae, and plugs the jack into Brandon's phone. The MAC DRE      
       now pumps through the whole car.





     Goldenrod                                        70.



                 Right on lil bruh!

       More commuters start to dance, including Darius, and his two
       friends, who move like professional "Turf" dancers.




       The Bay Bridge and skyscrapers are beautifully illuminated in
       the moonlight.




       A group of hundreds of people are gathered on the pier
       overlooking the water. The group is mostly white though
       diverse in age: Teenagers, young families with kids in
       strollers, middle aged married couples, tweens.

       They check their wrist watches and cell phones periodically,
       and look to the sky with anticipation.




       It's a party on BART. The train starts to move, and everybody



                 Wait, how we gonna do the
                 countdown?


                 Use your phone bruh.


                 My phone don't got no seconds.

       Oscar looks around the car, zeroes in on Donald.


                 You bruh, you got a watch?

       Donald holds up his left wrist and nods his head. Oscar turns
       to Brandon.                                                       


                 Turn the music off bruh!!!

       Brandon turns down the dial on the music.                         
     Blue                                              71.




       We see what the crowd is staring at- A large old fashioned
       clock on the side of the Ferry Building reads 11:58. The
       minute hand ticks to 11:59pm.




       Oscar, Sophina and the other commuters are huddled around
       Donald, who is now standing up, watching the second hand tick
       on his watch, and waving his right finger like an orchestral
       conductor.







       Hundreds of faces look off into the sky with anticipation in
       their eyes.











       A CHILD, white girl about 6 years old, points to something in
       the sky, she smiles.














       A clear sky except for a small gray spec that slowly
       approaches the center of frame and suddenly...





     Blue                                          71A.


       BOOM! The spec explodes into a dazzling cluster of red and
       blue fireworks.


     Goldenrod                                         72.





       The crowd looks on with wonder, their faces illuminated by
       the fireworks.







       It's pandemonium. Everyone on the car is going crazy. Brandon      
       turns on the MAC DRE again.


                    Happy TWENTY- TEN!!! FUCK TWO


       Donald gives Karen a peck on the lips. Lauren and Ashae kiss
       passionately, showing off. Cato and Jason record this with         
       their cell phones.





       The fireworks are dazzling. Now greens, blues, purples, and
       whites, all beaming brilliantly.

       The crowd cheers in amazement. An ASIAN COUPLE kiss.




       Oscar holds Sophina close.


                    Happy New Year baby.


                    Happy New Year, Osc.

       They kiss.


                    Now approaching Montgomery Station.

       Oscar and Sophina brace, as the train comes to a stop, almost
       loosing their balance. They laugh at this. The doors open and
       the group, along with the other passengers, exit the car.
     Goldenrod                                    73-74.




       The group walks through the Bart Station Lobby, ahead A
       MUSICIAN sits in a chair playing an ERHU, a box full of
       dollar bills sits in front of him.

       As the group passes the Musician, Cato drops a dollar in his       
       hat.


                 Nigga, you could have gave that
                 shit to me!


                 Learn how to play the guitar, and I
                 got you bruh!

       The group steps onto an escalator, and we follow them up to-




       The group exits the BART station and walks out onto the
       Downtown San Francisco street. PEDESTRIANS are everywhere.


                 I gotta find somewhere to pee.


                 I gotta go too.

       We loose the group into the crowd of pedestrians.








     Goldenrod                                      75.







       Oscar looks from closed store to closed store, the group
       following closely behind him. He spots Sammy, Middle Eastern,     
       Early 50's, closing the metal gates on his store.

       Oscar trots up ahead of the group to Sammy.                       


                 Say bruh.


                 We're all closed.


                 I know man, but a couple young
                 ladies with me really got to use
                 the bathroom man.


                 I'm all closed up, besides, I don't
                 even have a rest room for
                 customers.


                 But you got one for employees
                 right?

       Sammy ignores him.                                                

       Sophina, Vanessa, and the rest of the group gather behind
       Oscar now.

       Sammy shuts the gate and pulls out the key.                       

       Oscar sees this. He turns to Sophina and Vanessa who look as
       if they are both about to explode.

       Oscar goes into his pocket. He pulls out a $10 bill.





     Goldenrod                                      76.



                 Look bruh, I aint rich. This my
                 last ten dollars. All I got on me.
                 Now you can take this $10, and open
                 the store up and let them use the
                 bathroom. Or you could go home, and
                 when you get here tomorrow, its
                 gonna be a puddle of piss right
                 there.

       Oscar points to the ground in front of the door.


                 Cause they aint gonna piss on
                 themselves bruh.

       Oscar holds out the money.

       Sammy turns and looks at him.                                     

                 Just two girls?

       Oscar looks back to the group. Sophina and Vanessa step up
       meekly.


                 These two right here.

       Sammy looks them over for a beat.                                 


                 Come on.

       He opens the gate and starts to unlock the door.


                 Thank you so much.

       He nods and opens up the door. Oscar steps over and tries to
       hand him the $10 bill, but Sammy waves it off.                    


                 Its okay. Happy New Year.


                 Right on bruh. Happy New Year to
                 you too. Thank you.

       He nods back at Oscar and walks into the store followed by
       the two girls.

       Oscar looks back at the group.



     Goldenrod                                      77.


       A limo, filled with girls has pulled up down the street.
       Brandon walks up and tries to talk his way onto it. All the      
       boys head over and talk to the girls, leaving Oscar by
       himself for a beat.


                 Please tell me this place has a
                 bathroom.

       Oscar turns around sees PETER a white thirty something guy in
       a North Face jacket. His wife STEPH, 30's is six months
       pregnant, and is doing the same potty dance we saw earlier
       from Vanessa.

       Oscar pounds on the glass door of the liquor store. Sammy        
       walks out into view. He lifts his hands, "What?"

       Oscar points to Steph. Sammy opens up the door.                  


                 You gotta be kidding me.


                 She pregnant...

       Steph looks at him with puppy dog eyes. Sammy breaks down and    
       lets her in.


                 Thank you.

       Sammy turns to Oscar.                                            


                 No more man.

       Oscar nods.


                 Thanks bro.

       Sammy closes the door.                                           


                 Appreciate that man. Thought she
                 was gonna have to go in the street.


                 No problem.

       Oscar notices the ring on Peter's finger.





     Green                                           78.



                 How long yall been married?


                 Eight years.

       Oscar nods at this. Pete looks at Oscar's hand for a ring,
       doesn't see one.


                 You thinking about it?

       Oscar nods.


                 What's stopping you?


                 Money.


                 Shitty reason. When we got married,
                 we had nothing. Lived in the back
                 of her parent's house for the first
                 two years.


                 For real?


                 Shit you not man. I wasn't working
                 at all and she's a teacher, which
                 might as well be the same thing as
                 far as money goes.


                 How'd you get the ring?

       Peter looks around for a beat.


                 I stole it.

       Oscar looks at him like he is crazy.





     Pink                                              79.



                 Yeah man, I told you, I had
                 nothing. I used to be good with
                 credit cards if you know what I
                 mean. I wouldn't go that route if I
                 were you though man.


                 Yeah, I'm straight off that.


                 Yeah. I ended up getting locked up
                 for a bit. My wife had to sell the
                 ring to bail me out.
                 Got my business going about a year
                 after I got out, and got her the
                 one she wears now.


                 What you do?


                 I own a web design company. We do a
                 lot of business with companies in
                 the valley.

       Peter pulls out his wallet and hands Oscar a card. Oscar
       looks at it.


                 Peter?
                     
                 Oscar.

       They shake hands.


                 Hit me up if you ever need anything
                 man. But about that ring bro, it
                 doesn't matter. If she loves you,
                 any ring'll do.


                 What about the wedding though?


                 Shit man. Find whoever's got the
                 nicest backyard. Tell all your boys
                 over there to each bring a dish.

       Oscar laughs at this.





     Goldenrod                                       80.


       The three girls, Sophina, Vanessa, and Steph make their way
       out of the Store laughing like best friends. Sammy follows         
       them and closes the door.


                 Okay.
                     
                 It was nice meeting you guys.


                 Thanks again, and take care man.

       Peter and Steph head down the street.

       Oscar, Sophina, and Vanessa cross the street to meet the rest
       of the group.


                 This was a burnt ass mission. Let's
                 get back to the house.

       The group nods, and they head back across the street walking
       briskly.







       The platforms is PACKED. The group comes off the stairs and
       we see a train is already there, doors open.


                 Come'on bruh, this us.

       Cato cuts through people to get close to the train entrance.       

       Oscar grabs Sophina by the hand and follows closely behind
       Cato.                                                              





     Goldenrod                                      81.



                 Hold up, bruh bruh.

       The rest of the group passes up Oscar, following Cato. We see    
       through the windows of the train that each car is full to the
       brim. Standing room only.


                 This shit packed bruh. Let's catch
                 the next one.


                 It might not be a next one baby.


                 Come'on bruh!

       Cato jumps onto the train, Sophina does as well. Oscar looks     
       around for a beat, and then steps on.

       We stay outside of the train as we watch the doors close
       behind him, and the train takes off. The cars go by, picking
       up speed rapidly until we are left looking at a dark empty
       tunnel. We hold on this.




       It's a multi ethnic sardine can. Oscar holds on to the
       overhead rail, and Sophina holds on to him, her head resting
       on his chest.


                 West Oakland Station

       The train begins to slow down, and a LONE COMMUTER, stands up
       and move towards the door. Sophina sees the open seat and
       quickly slides into it. Oscar remains standing uncomfortably.

                 Find a spot... I'm good.

       Oscar nods, and begins to looks around the car for a less
       dense section. He makes out a small space in the corner of
       the train car, and starts towards it. He passes by an OLDER
       COUPLE, white 40's. This is MR. and MRS. ZAFIRATOS. They
       stand next to their SON .

       As Oscar pushes past him, Mr. Zafiratos gives Oscar an
       unwelcome look. He pulls his daughter away as to avoid Oscar
       bumping up against her. Oscar exchanges a look with him
       briefly, and continues to push towards the space.


                 Now approaching Lake Merritt
                 Station.

       The Train comes to a stop, and commuters crush onto the car.

       We see Katie, from Farmer Joe's, standing a few people in
       front of Oscar wearing a jacket over the same outfit. She's
       hugged up with JOE, a handsome white man in his 20's wearing
       a CAL sweatshirt. He holds her protectively.


                 Please stand by, doors are closing.

       DING. The doors close, and the train takes off.

       Katie closes her eyes and leans into Joe's chest for a beat,
       then Joe pulls her out of the way of a passenger who squeezes
       by. Katie opens her eyes, and sees that the passenger is
       Oscar. Her face lights up.

                 Oscar. Oscar!

       Oscar turns around a bit confused.


                 Right here. Its me, from Farmer
                 Joe's.

       Oscar continues to look, until he hears a MAN'S VOICE from
       right behind him.


                 Oscar? Oscar the fucking snitch?


       Oscar recognizes this voice, and he doesn't like it. He whips
       around to find, standing a few people away---

       Cale, wearing an oversized white T shirt, and a multitude of
       tattoos on his forearms. With him are FOUR LARGE HISPANIC
       MEN, and his GIRLFRIEND.


                 Wussup with that shit you was
                 hollerin?

       Cale turns to one of the Men.


                 This the cat from bitch ass Palma
                 Ceia I was tellin you about.

       The Hispanic Man cuts a mean look at Oscar, flashes a gang
       sign at him.


                 Watch out with that shit bruh. This
                 aint the time. I got my girl here
                 and shit.


                 Fuck that shit, Bitch! My girl
                 right here too. I don't give a

                 Fuck Palma Ceia!!!

       Cale moves towards Oscar.

       Sophina sees the commotion going on and stands up and looks,
       sees Oscar about to be surrounded. She starts towards him.


                 Osc! Osc whats going on?

       Oscar cuts his eyes from Cale to Sophina.


                     
                 Get Cato and them niggas!                              

       BOOM! Cale punches Oscar in the right side of his face-hard.

       Oscar rebalances himself and punches back, with three quick
       shots to the head and chest. He moves like an experienced
       fighter, but both men struggle in the crowded train.

       The other passengers begin to shout and try to move out of
       the way.

       Sophina sees this, and turns to their group of friends who
       are at the back of the train.


                 Cato! They jumpin Osc!                                 

       Cato, Brandon, and the rest of the group head towards the        
       commotion and make their way through the other passengers.


                 Fuck these niggas bruh!

       Brandon pushes past Mr. Zafiratos who is holding his             
       daughter. And looking on at the fight.


                 Watch it! You're gonna get somebody
                 hurt!

       Cale moves in and grabs Oscar, putting him into a headlock.
       Oscar grapples with him, holding his other arm to avoid being
       punched in the head.

       Cale's friends circle Oscar and throw punches at his back.

       Cato and Brandon push through to be in arm's reach of the       
       fight, and start swinging on Cale and his friends. Cato hits    
       Cale flush in the back of the head.


                 Get off of him!

       Brandon punches one of the large Hispanic men hard.             


                 Wussup now nigga?

       Sophina swings on Cale's girlfriend. Just misses her.
     Goldenrod                                      86.







       Oscar has breaks free of Cale's hold and is being held back
       and secured by Kris and Cato. Cale and his group back up off     
       Oscar's group and begin to flee to the second car, pushing
       past the other passengers.


                 You alright bruh?

       Oscar nods and brushes his head off.


                 You okay baby?


                 Yeah, I'm good. Fuck them bruh.

                 Everyone remain please remain calm.
                 There will be a slight delay here.

       The train starts to decelerate. Oscar looks around, looks at
       the other passengers on the train.

       They look at Oscar and his friends like lepers.


                 We gotta get off this train bruh.

       Something isn't right here, the platform is completely empty.
       The group exits the train, lead by Sophina, Vanessa and Kris.
       Oscar follows behind them apprehensively.

       As other commuters exit the train, Cato mixes into this group     
       of people and breaks off to the side.                             

       As they walk Sophina notices two Cops coming up to the            
       platform- One is an imposing white man in his 30's, tall
       athletic build, military haircut. This is OFFICER CARUSO. He
       is flanked by a short female officer who looks to be in her
       late 20's this is OFFICER SALAZAR.

       Sophina taps Oscar quickly.


                 Baby, the boys already up here.

       Oscar stops dead in his tracks.


                 Just get back on the train, get
                 back on the train, quick..


                 Aight. Imma meet you at the Hayward
                 station, Okay?

       Sophina nods. Oscar turns to Jason                                


                 The boys, bruh.

       Cato blends into the crowd headed towards the far end of the      
       platform. Jason quickly goes back to CAR 1, Oscar jumps onto      
       the closest train, CAR 2.

        Oscar pushes his way onto the train and looks out of the           
        door.                                                              







        Sophina, Vanessa, Kris, and Carlos, Brandon, and Tim walk          
        towards the escalator. Kris out ahead of Sophina and Vanessa.      

        Sophina, Vanessa, and Kris, make it past the cops, but             
        Caruso stops Carlos, Brandon, and Tim. The officers pull out       
        their tasers and back the three boys up against the wall.          
        Brandon takes off his jacket and Caruso takes it, searches it      
        and throws it. Brandon says something to Salazar, and Caruso       
        roughly slams him against the wall.                                

        Caruso turns back towards the train, and seemingly makes           
        direct eye contact with Oscar.

       Oscar turns and tries to hide in the crowd He tries not to         
       look suspicious, but he sticks out like a sore thumb on this
       car. He sees Cale and his friends in the crowd And Zafiratos.      


                 If you were involved in the fight
                 get the fuck off the train right
                 now!
                      
                 Don't make me come in there and
                 pull you off. This ain't my first
                 fucking Rodeo.

       Mrs. Zafiratos looks at Oscar.


                 Just get off the train, please.                          
                 People have families on here.                            

       There is a visible commotion at the door, and passengers
       start to move back, we see Caruso storm through the car
       doors.

       He looks around the crowd, and makes eye contact with Mrs.         
       Zafiratos gives a subtle look over at Oscar.

       Caruso sees Oscar and makes his way towards him.

                 What are you talking about? What
                 did I do?

       Caruso pulls out his taser and points it at Oscar's neck.


                 Come on. Let's go.

       Oscar immediately puts his hands up.


                 Alright, alright, Fuck.                                 

       Oscar walks towards Caruso, who quickly grabs him by the back
       of the shirt and walks him out of the train car.

       Caruso walks Oscar over to the wall.


                 Sit down right here.

       He places Oscar in between Carlos and Brandon. Oscar puts his     
       hands up, still holding his cellphone.


                 What the fuck bruh, we didn't do                        
                 anything.

       Caruso turns and looks back at CAR 1 for a beat.

       Down the platform, Cato watches Pirone and his friends            
       closely. A small crowd around him.

       Salazar stands over Brandon holding her taser pointed towards     
       the ground. She grabs her walkie talkie.


                     
                 On the platform, in need of backup,
                 four suspects apprehended.                              

       She looks back at Brandon and Oscar.                              


                 This is some bullshit. Yall not                         
                 even the real police. You way too                       
                 cute to be a cop anyway...                              

       Brandon starts to stand up slowly.                                


                 Be cool bruh, chill out. Let me                         
                 talk to her.                                            


                 Hey, sit back down!

       She points the taser at Brandon's chest. Brandon backs up         
       against the wall, but does not sit down.


                 Why the fuck you keep pointing that                     
                 taser at me, bitch? We didn't even

       We see Caruso pull Jason off the train and slam him to the         
       ground, face down. He straddles him and handcuffs his wrists
       behind his back.

       He picks Jason up by the handcuffs, and drags him towards the      
       wall.

       Oscar looks at this in shock. He turns his attention back to
       Brandon, who still is standing. Salazar pushes Brandon in his      
       chest.                                                             


                 Sit the fuck back down!


                 Get your hands off me.                                   

       Oscar stands up.


                     
                 I got him.

       He holds his hands out puts his hands on Salazar's forearms,
       and brushes them away from Brandon's chest.                        


                                                              
                 Chill out bruh, chill out. Chill
                 out and we goin home man.

       Salazar pushes at Brandon again, and Oscar reaches out his         
       hands to stop her.


                 Don't touch me!                                          

       Caruso hears this, and quickly lets go of Jason, who is now        
       sitting down. He rushes over to Oscar and-

       BOOM! Caruso punches Oscar flush in the right side of his
       face, knocking Oscar's head up against the wall.




       The passengers ERUPT at the sight of this.



     Goldenrod                                      96.




       Cato sees the punch.                                              


                   What the fuck?

       He walks closer to the scene.                                     







       Oscar holds his face where he got hit and sits back down. He
       looks up at Caruso with confusion and puts his hands up.


                   What the fuck is you doing bruh?


                   Hey!

       Caruso quickly removes his Taser and points it at Brandon's       
       face. Brandon quickly sits down, and puts his hands up.           
       Caruso turns to Salazar.


                   You alright Babe?

       She nods.





     Goldenrod                                        97.


       The crowd on the train is ROARING now. Yelling various things
       about the police.


                 I'm just tryna get home. I got a
                 daughter at home bruh.                                    

       Caruso points his taser at the rest of the boys sitting down-
       waving it like a flashlight.


                 Shut up.




       Oscar looks down the platform and sees Cato approaching. He         
       looks over at the train, sees nothing but cell phones and
       video cameras.

       He looks to the escalator and sees a huge, clean shaven white
       cop in his late 20's sprinting up to the platform: this is
       OFFICER INGRAM. He is followed by 3 other Cops, NEWSOME
       .


                 Hey, hey officer, this shit is
                 brutality! What the fuck you doing
                 to them?

       Cato takes out his cellphone and starts to record.                  


                 Fuckin fake ass cops. We got you on
                 camera!

       Ingram jogs over to Cato.                                           


                 Hey, back up! Get back!

       Ingram reaches for his taser, pulls it out. Cato keeps              
       recording, but backs up.


                 You gonna Tase me for using my
                 cellphone?

       Newsome and Sanchez run over to keep Cato back. Newsome             
       stands in the view of Cato's camera phone. Ingram turns and         
       jogs over to help Caruso.

       Caruso arrives next to Ingram, who turns to him.



     Goldenrod                                      98.



                     
                 This is a shit show. Keep these
                 assholes secured, I'm gonna check
                 the train for witnesses.

       Ingram nods. He points his taser at Oscar and Brandon. Oscar     
       takes a picture of Ingram pointing his taser at Brandon with     
       his cellphone. His phone rings in his hand.

       He checks it: "Sophina Calling". He answers it.


                     
                 Phina?







       Sophina stands on the sidewalk of the BART station entrance.
       Vanessa and Kris stand behind her


                 Osc, where you at? Are you on the
                 train?


                 Hell naw, we still up here at
                 Fruitvale. They holding us here and
                 beatin on us for no reason.

                 us up out of here though. Imma hit
                 you back.

       Oscar hangs up the phone. He sees Caruso walking over to him
       Oscar stands up against the wall.


                 Are you in charge man? Look...




       Caruso rushes Oscar, pushes him into a seated position, and
       knees him in the right side of his face.



     Goldenrod                                   99.



                 What the fuck, bruh?

       Caruso holds Oscar by his shirt.


                 Are you gonna fucking comply? Are
                 you gonna comply?


                 I'm complying, just take your
                 fucking hands off of me! I'm
                 fucking complying.

       Caruso backs up off of Oscar.


                 That's brutality you fucking toy
                 cop!

       Oscar holds his face.


                 Chill out Brandon bruh. We about to                  
                 go home. They can hold us here as
                 long as they want, but they can't
                 arrest us bruh, we aint do shit.


                 What?

       He turns to Ingram.


                 Cuff these two assholes. They're
                 fucking going to jail.


                 Get on your knees.

       Brandon who lifts up onto his knees.                           


                 Fuck, bruh!


                 You can't arrest him. Fuck that
                 shit. For what? We aint do noting!

     Goldenrod                              99A.



                 Yall some fake ass cops foreal.





     Goldenrod                                     100.



                                                                
                 Shut the fuck up bruh.
                     
                 Just tell us why you're arresting
                 us. We didn't do anything wrong.


                 We don't have to tell you shit.


                 Bruh I got a daughter at home, I'm
                 trying to get to. I'm not trying to
                 go to jail.


                 You should have thought about that
                 before you decided to be a piece of
                 shit.


                 Man you a bitch ass nigga, foreal.

       Caruso walks closer to Oscar.


                 I'm the bitch ass nigga huh?


                 What? What the fuck?


                 Bitch ass nigga huh?!

       Oscar stiffens up.


                 Don't call me a nigga bruh!




       Oscar lifts up to his knees.




       BOOM! Ingram takes Oscar down to the ground from behind, but
       Oscar lands awkwardly, with his back on Carlos' legs. Ingram
       continues to push down on top of him. Caruso backs up,
       nodding his head.





     Green                   100A.



                 Yeah! Yeah!





     Goldenrod                                     101.


       Carlos holds his hands up while Oscar squirms, now on his
       side.









       Caruso bends down, grabs Oscar's head, and puts his knee on
       it, driving his weight into the Oscar's ear. Oscar writhes in
       pain.










                 Don't worry about it. Don't worry.





                 Fuck, I can't move!

       Caruso stands up, pushing off Oscar's head with his hands.

       Ingram flips him over off of Carlos' legs and onto his
       stomach. Oscar squirms again, while Caruso grabs his hand
       trying to put it behind his back. Caruso puts his knee back
       down on Oscar, driving down hard, at the base of his head,
       pressing Oscar's face against the ground.





                 Fuck. I can't get his hands! Back
                 up.

       Caruso lifts up off of Oscar. Ingram stands up a bit, keeping
       one knee in Oscar's back, reaches on the right side of his
       belt and pulls a black gun from the holster.

       He stands up, aims it at Oscar's back. BLAM!!!




      Goldenrod                                       102.


        Oscar's body jerks against the pavement. He lets out a
        sickening, hollow sound.

        Dead silence.




        Sophina whips her head around towards the platform.




        Katie and Joe's jaw's drop at the sound of the shooting.




        We see Pete, and Steph, who have been on this train the whole
        time. Pete recording with his video camera, with shock on his
        face.




        Cato is frozen by shock. Caruso takes a step back, and looks       
        at Ingram with confusion.

        Oscar takes a struggled breath in, coughs up some blood. He
        stiffly turns his body around to Ingram.


                  ..you shot me... you shot me. i got
                  a daughter...

        Brandon, Carlos, Tim stare at Oscar is disbelief.                  


                  They shot Osc! They fuckin shot Osc
                  bruh!

        Cato looses it, he pushes past the police officers in front        
        of him. He throws his cellphone at Ingram, just missing his
        face. It hits the wall, and explodes into pieces. the Cops
        rush Cato, taking him to the ground.                               

        Oscar's friends go berserk they start screaming. Brandon           
        tries to stand up, still handcuffed.



                      




      Green                                 102A.









      Goldenrod                                     103.


        Three Cops rush over and take Brandon to the ground. Other         
        Cops descend on the other boys.


                  Call the ambulance!




        Ingram flips Oscar back over and handcuffs him, and starts to
        search him.


                  What the fuck you handcuffing him
                  for?

        The Cops take all of the boys towards the escalators. But
        none of them go without a struggle. It takes four Cops to
        control Brandon.                                                   

        Caruso runs over to Tenisha who looks on from the Operator
        car with panic in her eyes.


                  Take off!
                      
                  Go!




        The Passengers are shouting and going crazy, still filming.
        The doors suddenly close.


                  Hey! Hey open the fucking doors!
                  Somebody help him!!!




        Mr. Zafiratos holds his daughter while looking out the
        windows as if he'd just seen a ghost. Cale still blends into
        the crowd. The doors close.




        Passengers are even crazier on this car. Hanging out the
        doors in the front of the crowd are Katie and Joe. Katie
        continues to record with her iPhone- her face red with rage.





      Green                                         103A.


        The car doors start to close, but Katie sticks her hand out
        them causing them to open back up. She continues filming.
      Goldenrod                                        104.




        Tenisha looks down at the control board, while Caruso leans
        in her car window.


                  Go! Fucking pull off!


                  I can't somebody's blocking the
                  doors.




        Caruso turns and looks down the platform. He sees Katie
        hanging out of the first car and sprints over to her.


                  Clear the door!







        Caruso pushes Katie's hand back and the doors shut. The train
        pulls off. Caruso grabs his walkie.


                      
                  Yeah there's been a shooting. Here
                  at the Fruitvale station--

        Ingram finishes searching Oscar only finds a wallet. He's
        sweating bullets. Caruso runs over to Ingram.


                  What the fuck happened?

        Ingram can't answer. Caruso snatches Oscar's wallet out of
        his hands and waves him away. He and bends down and un-cuffs
        Oscar. He rolls him over and we see Oscar's eyes are starting
        to grow distant.


                      
                  Come'on breathe, man.

        Caruso bends down to look at Oscar.





      Green                                         104A.


        We see Oscar's phone is on the ground ringing. The screen
        reads, "Sophina Calling".
      Green                                            105.




        Sophina now frantic, stands with her cellphone to her ear.

        Kris and Vanessa talk to three POLICE OFFICERS who are
        guarding the entrance like club bouncers.

        Sophina hangs up the phone, then quickly dials another
        number.







        Only moonlight fills the room. A cellphone RINGS. Wanda wakes
        up, checks it, answers the phone.


                  Sophina?


                  The police got Oscar and them and
                  we heard something I don't know if
                  it was a beanbag or a taser or
                  what.


                  Sophina, baby calm down. I can't
                  hear you. Is Oscar there with you?


                  Naw, he upstairs, with the Police
                  and I can't see them. We downstairs-


                  Where are you?


                  We in Oakland, at Fruitvale BART.


                  Did Oscar get arrested?


                  I don't know, I think so.

        Wanda closes her eyes for a beat, this hurts. She gets out of
        bed and starts putting on her clothes.





      Green                                         105A.


        A SIREN is now super close. Sophina turns to see four
        PARAMEDICS rush through the emergency entrance turnstile
        rolling a large gurney with medical equipment on it.

        Sophina hangs up the phone and runs towards the paramedics.


                  What happened?

        They ignore her, and quickly get into the elevator with their
        gear, the doors close behind them. Sophina hears COMMOTION
        coming from the escalators. She looks over and sees Brandon        
        kicking and struggling, as the Cops bring him down. Cato,          
        Tim, Jason, and Carlos follow, all surrounded by Cops.             

        Vanessa and Kris run over to them as the bring them out
        towards the parking lot, where several Police Cars are
        parked.


                  What happened?

        Sophina sprints over to the cars. Cato and Brandon are going       
        so crazy that they don't even notice her.


                      
                  Get back!!

        Sophina get's Jason's attention.                                   


                  Where Osc at? What happened?









        The Cops stuff Jason into the back of their car before he can      
        answer. They stuff Tim into the same car.                          

        It takes four Cops to get Brandon. Another group of Cops are       
        having the same problem with Cato.                                 




        Oscar still lies on the ground, Caruso lies over him, holding
        his hand.



      Goldenrod                                        107.



                      
                  Come on man keep your eyes open.
                  Breathe, man.

        The elevator doors open, and the Paramedics rush towards
        Oscar. Caruso stands up, starts talking to PARAMEDIC 1, hands
        him Oscar's ID.

        The others immediately begin tending to Oscar. They check his
        vitals, and pull out a pair of large scissors and quickly cut
        off his shirt. They flip him over, revealing a large entry
        wound on his left shoulder blade. It bleeds profusely.
        Paramedic 1 walks over to Oscar and kneels down.


                  Oscar? Oscar can you hear me?

        Oscar tries to nod.




        Sophina is in tears, arguing with the Cops guarding the
        platform.


                  Please let me through, that's my
                  boyfriend up there.

        Her cellphone rings. She looks down at it and grows more
        frantic. She answers it.





                  Sophina baby, what's going on?


                      
                  The cops won't let me through, and,
                  and Jason said that Osc...                               



        Horror flashes over Wanda's face.





        Sophina is hysterical, we finally see what she sees-






      The paramedics rushing Oscar, dressed only in his red boxers
      out of the elevator on a gurney, his mouth connected to a
      hand pumped oxygen mask.

      They quickly wheel him out towards the ambulance, which is
      parked next to the Police cars. Sophina runs after them.


                   That's my fucking baby daddy right
                   there! Is he dead? Did they fucking
                   kill him?

      PARAMEDIC 1 turns to Sophina as they load Oscar in.


                   He's been shot, he's still alive
                   but we gotta get him to Highland.

      He quickly boards the ambulance, they shut the door in
      Sophina's face. Sophina breaks down.


                       
                   Sophina, Sophina!


                   They shot him. They shot Oscar!
                   They say he alive, but he's
                   bleeding and his eyes was closed.




      Wanda screams. She prays to herself and regains control a
      bit.


                   Where are they taking him?


                       
                   They takin him to Highland, you
                   gotta come and get us, our car in
                   Hayward.


                   I'm on my way.

      Wanda hangs up the phone, and rushes out of the bedroom.
      Goldenrod                                       109.




        Sophina hangs up the phone and watches as the Ambulance
        speeds off down Fruitvale Blvd.

        Cato, still in the back of the police car, is kicking the         
        window with both feet. Brandon continues to scream from his       
        car. The police cars pull off.





        The doors burst open, and the Paramedics wheel Oscar into the
        ER Trauma room.




        We are close on Oscar as he lies on his back, unconscious
        breathing tubes are attached to his mouth. His chest rises up
        and down slowly, struggled.

        SURGEONS, and PARAMEDICS move around Oscar.

        The LEAD SURGEON, a tall, slim Black man in his 50's, points
        to an object that lies just under Oscar's right clavicle,
        just under his skin.


                  It's here, its right beneath the
                  skin.


        The surgeon takes a scalpel and cuts into Oscar's skin, just
        above the protruding mass. Blood runs out, he presses down
        and pops out the bullet, that looks like a large metal
        mushroom. The surgeon examines it.


                  Jesus. It's like it hit something
                  solid. Bone wouldn't do this.

        He places the bullet into an empty beaker atop a cart. He
        turns back to Oscar and begins to stitch up the incision. The
        Lead Surgeon looks at xrays of Oscar's chest on a light
        board. Paramedic 2 stands over his shoulder.





      Goldenrod                                     110.



                  He was lying face down on the
                  ground.

        A Resident Surgeon points to a large dark cloud on the xrays.


                  Right here, right lung looks to be
                  what's causing the pulse problem.


        The Surgeon sticks a tube into the right side of Oscar's
        chest, and blood flows out of the tube uncontrollably.
        Spilling onto the floor.


                  Shit, Shit, we gotta get him
                  upstairs!

        The medical staff sees this, and kicks their movements into
        high gear.




        Oscar lies on the operating table, sedated. The Surgeons talk
        medical speak. They move with astounding quickness and
        precision. Lead Surgeon takes a large scalpel, and makes a 14
        inch incision under Oscar's right nipple.

        Blood rushes out, it's worse than they thought. It begins to
        hit the floor. A RESIDENT SURGEON reacts to this, and quickly
        grabs a large emesis basin. He puts it underneath the wound,
        catching the blood. Another Surgeon places a spreader into
        the wound, and opens it up.

        The Lead surgeon looks inside of the incision. He lets his
        head down in frustration at what he sees.


                  His lung's gone. We gotta prep for
                  removal.




        A NURSE stands behind a reception desk.. Wanda, Sophina,
        Vanessa, and Kris storm into the room. Wanda goes up to the
        RECEPTIONIST, a black woman in her 20's.

                  He's been shot, and they told me to
                  come here-

        The Nurse sits at the computer.




        Wanda nods.


                  He's still in the operating room.
                  Go to the ICU waiting room and                         
                  someone will be out soon to let you
                  know everything that's going on.

        Wanda nods and walks over towards the chairs.


                      
                  Lord please let him be okay. Please
                  watch over him with your healing
                  hands Lord. Keep him Safe Lord.
                  Keep him safe so that I can hold
                  him once again.




        The operation is fully underway. A surgeon removes Oscar's
        lung from the incision.

        We see a NURSE change out a bag of Donor Blood on one of the
        many IV systems Oscar is hooked up to. She tosses into a bin,
        where it lands atop five other empty bags.

        Wanda sits in the waiting room next to Sophina.

        The Boys storm into the room along with JACK BRYSON SR. a
        Hispanic looking man in his 40's. Kris greets the boys, and
        they head over to Wanda.

        He stands close to his sons Jack and Tim. The Nurse walks out    
        from behind the back room with the Lead Surgeon, who now
        wears fresh scrubs.


                  Wanda?

        Wanda nods, and stands up.


                  Oscar was shot, okay? We've
                  stabilized him, but he's in
                  critical condition. The bullet
                  caused massive internal bleeding
                  and we had to remove the right
                  lung.


                  His lung? How is he... How is he
                  going to be able to breathe?


                  Well, his breathing isn't our
                  concern. It's the bleeding. We're
                  working very hard to get his blood
                  to clot. But right now, his body
                  isn't taking the transfusions.

                  Hard to say, but we're gonna do
                  everything we can okay?


                  Okay, okay. Please do whatever you
                  can, okay? My son is a good boy.                        


                  Please do what you can. Please.

        He nods and pats Wanda on the shoulder for a beat, then turns
        and heads back into the ICU. Wanda walks back over to the
        group. She gives them the news from the doctor.




        Several Nurses Operate around Oscar who still lies
        unconscious his breathing sounding more struggled than ever.

        Suddenly blood begins to run from his right nostril, then his
        right eyelid, and his left nostril after that. His EKG
        machine begins to BEEP loudly.

        The Nurses go into panic mode.




        Early morning daylight streams into the waiting area. Where
        Wanda, Sophina, Chantay, Ceephus, Daryl, and Oscar's friends

        Lines of blood trickle from Oscar's eyes, nose, and mouth.
        The Lead is now in the room and has taken over commands.


                  Loosing a pulse.

        Oscar's body begins to violently shake.

        A young male RESIDENT DOCTOR, grabs the paddles, the Lead
        Surgeon touches Oscar's chest, we see under his skin is
        filled with fluid. He taps the Resident Doctor on the
        shoulder and shakes his head. He looks up at the clock.


                  Calling it. Time of Death 9:01 am.

        He pulls off his mask, frustrated, and walks out. Oscar's
        convulsions stop. A morbid, continuous beep echoes from the





        The Lead Surgeon walks out, and Wanda is still in the circle
        praying. The Nurse goes over to her, pulls her aside.

        Wanda approaches the Lead Surgeon with a hopeful look in her
        eyes. She reads his eyes for a beat.

        The Lead Surgeon looks at her for a beat. And shakes his
        head. Wanda puts her face in her hands, her legs wobble.
        Sophina who was watching and listening closely sees this. She
        breaks down, buries her face in Oscar's hoodie.

        Daryl and Ceephus run over to Wanda, just as he arrives, her       
        legs buckle a bit, he catches her.

        Oscar's friends begin to break down.

         The Lead Surgeon nods.


                     But its a homicide, so they can't
                     let you in the room with him, ok?

       Sophina looks up at a flat screen television in the hospital,
       sees a report that showing Oscar's picture.

       He nods.                                                          







       Sophina lets herself into the house. We see Rose in the
       bathroom sitting on the stool, grief-stricken. Sophina turns
       into the den, where Tatiana and her cousins are still asleep.
       She steps over them to get to Tatiana.


                  T, come on.

       Tatiana groggily wakes up. Sophina picks her up.




       Sophina walks in and looks around the house. Tatiana walks
       inside. And goes straight for Oscar and Sophina's bedroom.





      Goldenrod                                       117.



                  Daddy? Daddy? Time to go to "Chuck
                  E Cheese"!

        Tatiana comes out of the bedroom looking confused.


                  Where's Daddy?


                  Come on T, we gotta take a shower.




        The same shower from earlier. Sophina turns the water on,
        helps Tatiana with her clothes, and puts her in. She takes
        off her own clothes and steps in as well.


                  Is the water okay T?


                  Yeah. Where's daddy? Is he on
                  vacation again?


                  No.

        Sophina tries to find her words. Lets the water run on her
        face for a bit, then rubs down the friz in Tatiana's hair.


                  Remember when I told you about
                  God... and the angels?


                  Yeah.


                  And about how when we die we go to
                  heaven?


                  Yeah.                                                     


                  Well, God needed another angel, so
                  he took Daddy to come and live in
                  heaven with him.

        Tatiana looks at Sophina for a long beat.








                   But I don't want Daddy to live in
                   heaven. I want him to be with me.


                   He can't. Once you go to heaven,
                   you can't come back.

      Tatiana thinks about this.


                   Well does he have his cellphone?
                   Maybe if I call him and talk to
                   him, he will come back.


                   No. Daddy doesn't have his
                   cellphone baby. You can't call him
                   where he is.
