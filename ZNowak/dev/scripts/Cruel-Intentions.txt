             based on the novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses

                        by Choderlos De Laclos




                                                 February 10, 1998







     We circle around the island of Manhattan moving closer and
     closer till we're looking down on Fifth Avenue. As the
     melody continues to play we MOVE towards a building and ZOOM
     into a window.



     A fifty-year old female therapist  sits at
     her desk, frowning as she takes notes. Books of Jung and
     Freud line the shelves.

     A young man  sits in a chair in front
     of her looking impatient.

     The therapist continues to write notes.


               Jesus. We've been at this for six
               months.


               I know.


               And you haven't made an ounce of
               progress.


               I know.

     Sebastian takes out a cigarette.


                    
               There's no smoking in my office.

     Sebastian sneers at her then puts the cigarette away. Dr.
     Greenbaum finishes her notes and looks up at him, shaking
     her head.


               What do you want me to say? That I'm
               supposed to feel remorse because I act
               the way I do? The truth is I don't.

     Dr. Greenbaum shakes her head and takes notes.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Look, I'm not like all the other kids
               in high school. I don't care about book
               reports and extra-credit. Teachers
               are idiots anyway. The only challenge
               out there for me is women. You see a
               girl you like. You pursue them. You
               conquer. You move on. It's exciting.


               But you said you have the worst
               reputation.


               I do.


               Don't you want to change that?


               Let me tell you something, doctor.
               Chicks love a guy with a bad rap.
               They say they don't, but they don't
               mean it. They all think that they're
               the ones that are going to "save me."
               The trick is to let them think it's
               true.


               I think that's all the time we have
               for today.


               Same time next week?


               No. This is going to be our last
               session.


               Why? I like spending time with you.
               You know, you're quite attractive for
               a woman your age. You have killer legs.
               Killer.


               This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a
               lot of money to send you here. I'm
               trying to help you.


               Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big
               help.

     Sebastian picks up a book of Freud.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               He was a coke addict, you know.


               You think you can come in here with that
               cute little smirk on your face and try
               and flirt with me. It doesn't work,
               Sebastian.


               It works a little.


               No it doesn't. I see right through you.


               You do?


               I hope for your sake you grow out of
               this immature phase. It's going to get
               you into trouble.


               Well, you don't have to get nasty about
               it.

     Sebastian approaches a photo on her desk and picks it up.


               My daughter, Rachel.


               Yummy.


               Don't even think about it. Rachel is an
               exceptionally well rounded young
               woman, who happens to be attending
               Princeton this fall. She's way too
               smart to fall for your line of b.s.


               Really? Care to make a wager on that?


               Good luck, Sebastian.


               What, nervous I'm going to win?


               Would you please leave.

     Sebastian puts on his glasses and leaves.

                              DR. GREENBAUM 
               Asshole.

     The doctor stews for a moment, then reaches into her
     desk, sifts through some papers where she finds a pack of
     Benson &amp; Hedges and lights one up. She looks at the photo
     of her daughter, then hits the speaker phone and dials.

                              DR. GREENBAUM 
               Rachel, it's mom.





     RACHEL, Doctor Greenbaum's daughter sits at her desk,
     crying while holding the phone.


               Hi, mom.


               Honey, is something wrong?

     Rachel cries for a moment.


               He told me he loved me and I believed
               him.


               Who told you?


               You don't know him. I'm so stupid.

     She continues to cry.


               Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep
               breath, and step out of the circle.


               Would you cut the psycho babble bullshit,
               mom. There's pictures of me on the internet.


     MONITOR - A nudie web-sight. The title reads "Ivy League
     Bound." Beneath the caption is a photo of Rachel tied to
     a bed and smiling with a Princeton banner covering her
     privates.


               What kind of pictures?


               Nudie pictures, what do you think?


               Jesus Christ, how can you be so
               stupid?


               I don't know. He was just so charming.
               All he did was talk about how I had
               killer legs and how we wanted to
               photograph them. Things just got out
               of hand from there.
                    
               Mom? Are you there? Mom?
                    
               Mother!!!!



     Doctor Greenbaum bolts out of her office and spots
     Sebastian standing in the elevator.


               You son of a bitch.

     Doctor Greenbaum races down the hall pushing several
     people out of her way. Sebastian stares at her
     expressionless as the elevator doors close.

                              DR. GREENBAUM 
               You're gonna pay for this you little
               shit. You hear me.

     A DENTIST peers outside of his office to see what's
     going on. He exchanges looks with Doctor Greenbaum.

                              DR. GREENBAUM 
               Fuck off, Harold.

     He gasps.



     A METER MAID is writing a ticket on a car when a Porsche
     pulls up in front of the townhouse and parks in a red
     zone. Sebastian steps out of the car and walks up the
     steps to the townhouse.


               You can't park there.

     Sebastian turns to her and sneers. He takes out a wad of
     money and shoves it in her breast pocket before entering
     the townhouse.





     CLOSE ON:  A tuna on a chopping board. WHACK! A butcher
     knife comes down on the tuna cutting it's head off.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands ripping open the fish.

     CLOSE ON: Two hands rolling a chunk of tuna into a rice
     roll.



     CLOSE ON: Two hands which carry a lavish tray of sushi
     through several doors until we enter the final door
     leading into -



     A enormous living room by Manhattan standards, with a
     view that overlooks the park. Eclectic art from around
     the world emphasize the Valmont's passion for travel.

     SOOK-HEE, the Valmont's housekeeper sets a tray of sushi
     in front of -

     KATHRYN MERTEUIL, a seventeen year old porcelain
     skinned WASP with all the grooming you could want in an
     East Coast child. She sits with a forced smile on her
     face and listens attentively as -

     BUNNY CALDWELL, a forty year old nouveau-riche socialite
     talks incessantly. CECILE CALDWELL, her beautiful
     teenage daughter, sits by her side. She wears a T-shirt
     with a Koala Bear on it.


               I can't tell you how happy we are that
               Cecile is going to be attending Oakwood with you
               this fall. You've always been an
               inspiration to Beau and I on raising
               her. We just hope she can rise to the
               high standards which you've set for
               her.


               I'll do my best.

     Sook-Hee pours a dish of soy sauce in front of Kathryn.

                              KATHRYN 
                    
               Thank you, Sook-Hee. That will be
               all.

     Sook-Hee leaves.


               What was that?


               I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a
               beautiful language.

                              MRS. CALDWELL 
               Kathryn is a straight A student at
               Oakwood as well as being President of
               the French Club. Listen to whatever
               she has to say and you'll go far.


                    
               You're too kind.


               How do you do it? I mean with all peer pressuring
               that goes on in high school. Where
               do you get your strength?


               I know this sounds corny, but whenever
               I feel temptations of peer pressure,

                    
               turn to God and he helps me through the
               problem. Call me an anachronism, but
               it works.


               That's beautiful.


               What are the boys like?


               Cecile, is that the best you can do?
                    
               You must forgive her, Kathryn. She's never
               been in a co-educational atmosphere before.


               Don't worry, it's totally understandable.
               Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood
               are very upstanding gentleman, however
               there are the occasional bad apples.


               Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't
               believe they didn't expel him after what he
               did to the school nurse.


               I hear she's recovering quite well.

     Mrs. Caldwell turns to see Sebastian standing in the
     doorway. He walks over and takes a seat.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Nice to see you again, Mrs. Caldwell.


               You remember my daughter, Cecile.


               My, what an adorable shirt you're
               wearing.


               My father just took me on a trip to Australia.


               How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.


               Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.


               Outstanding.


               What year are you in?


               I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.


               But I thought high school is only four years.


               It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.

     He winks at Cecile.


               I think we'll be going now.
                    
               Thanks for all your help.

     Kathryn stands and approaches Cecile.


               I'll call you later and we'll get together
               and plan your curriculum.


               Thanks.
                    
               Nice meeting you.


               Ciao.


               Let's go, Cecile. Now!

     Cecile follows Mrs. Caldwell out the door. Kathryn
     closes the door behind them.


               Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash
               and her stupid daughter are doing in my
               house?


               I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.

     Kathryn sits on the sofa next to Sebastian. She unscrews
     her crucifix. The top part becomes a small spoon and the
     bottom part a small vial of coke.

                              KATHRYN 
               The parental units called while you were out.


               Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a
               mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my
               inheritance per usual?


               Hopefully, though she suspects that your
               decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the
               maid.

     Kathryn uses her crucifix as a coke-spoon and snorts a
     bump.

                              KATHRYN 
               What's wrong with you today? Therapy not
               going well?


               It was fine.

     He leaps off the sofa and starts to pace.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               I'm sick of sleeping with these insipid
               Manhattan Debutantes.

     He walks over to the wall where nude Botticelli hangs.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Nothing shocks them anymore.

     He scratches the nude's pubic area.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               I'm beginning to feel like I'm losing my
               touch.

     He kisses it.


               Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have
               a mission for you.


               What?



     COURT REYNOLDS, an Aryan seventeen year old preppy, wears
     a Polo sweater with an American Flag.


               You know Court Reynolds, son of Garret
               Reynolds?

     Kathryn steps into frame and embraces him. She is wearing
     the same sweater. He kisses her forehead and messes
     up her hair.


               You mean the Nazi who dumped you over Fourth
               Of July Weekend?



     Kathryn throws a sushi at him. Sebastian catches it.


               He didn't dump me. We had a parting of
               the ways.

     Sebastian stares her down.

                              KATHRYN 
               Alright he dumped me.

     He smiles, then swallows the sushi.



     A drunk Court sits in the driver's side and takes a final
     swig from his flask. He quickly passes out.


               I went to great lengths to please Court.
               Huge sacrifices were made on my part to
               keep him happy.

     Kathryn rises up INTO FRAME, looks at Court and scowls.


               Swallow?

     She spits on him, then wipes her mouth.


               What do you think?

     Kathryn sprays her mouth with Binaca.


               Sorry.




               In any event, my feelings were hurt when I
               learned that he had fallen for someone else.
               Someone chaste... pure... innocent.


               You don't mean?



     Cecile turns toward the camera, while eating a double scoop
     ice cream cone and wearing a Mickey Mouse Club hat.


               None other than Cecile Caldwell.

     She takes a lick of the ice cream, which falls off the cone.
     She mouths the word "shoot" and stomps her feet



     Sebastian snickers.


               I don't find this very funny,


               So that's what this is all about.
                    
               We'll get together and plan your
               curriculum.


               Keep your friends close and your
               enemies closer. When I get through
               with her, she'll be the premier Blow
               Job Queen of the Tri-State area and
               poor little Court's heart will be
               shattered.


               Why go through Cecile? Why not just
               attack Court?


               Because if there's an attack made on
               Court it could be traced back to me.
               I can't allow that to happen.
               Everybody loves me and I intend to
               keep it that way.


               I see your point... though why should
               I care?


               I need you to seduce our young Cecile.
               Introduce her to your world of
               decadence and debauchery.


               Sounds intriguing.


               She's quite cute you know. Young
               supple breasts, a tight firm ass and
               an uncharted pootie.

     Sebastian watches Kathryn rub herself. He licks his
     lips.

                              KATHRYN 
               Be her Captain Picard, Valmont.
               Boldly go where no man has gone
               before.

     Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues
     to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:


               I can't.

     Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.


               Why not?


               Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy.
               "But I thought high school was only
               four years." I mean, please. She knows
               nothing. She's seen nothing. I could
               have her under the table at Au Bar
               sucking me off before the appetizer
               arrived. Go get one of those moron
               friends of yours to do it. I have a
               reputation to uphold.


               Oh but diddling the therapist's
               daughter is a challenge?


               That was just simple revenge. What I
               have planned requires sheer genius.

     He takes a magazine and throws it on the table. Kathryn
     picks it up. It's the latest issue of "Seventeen."


               I'm not interested in the latest dating
               tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.


               Shut up and turn to page 64.

     She turns to the page. INSERT MAGAZINE ARTICLE: The title
     reads: A VIRGIN'S MANIFESTO. "Why I Plan To Wait
     Until Marriage," by Annette Harrison. Age 17. Kansas
     City, Missouri.


               Jesus Christ, is she for real?


               Oh yes. I've read it over and over again.
               This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little
               angel. A paradigm of chastity and
               virtue.


               B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to
               Kansas and woo little Dorothy.


               It just so happens we're not in Kansas
               anymore. Our little angel's father has
               accepted the new headmaster position at
               Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up
               in Connecticut while Daddy sells his
               house. Can you imagine what this would
               do for my reputation? Screwing the new
               headmaster's virginal daughter before
               school starts? It will be my greatest
               victory.


               You don't stand a chance. Even this is
               out of your league.


               Care to make a wager on that?


               I'll think about it...


               Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another
               chapter to my work of art.

     He holds up a leather bound JOURNAL.


               Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more
               queer?


               Could you be more desperate to read it?

     Sebastian stands to leave and heads to the door.


               Oh Sebastian. About that little wager
               of yours.

     He stops.

                              KATHRYN 
               Count me in.


               What are the terms?


               If you lose, then that hot little Porsche
               of yours is mine.


               And if I win?

     She approaches him.


               I'll give you something you've been
               jerking off about ever since our parents
               got married.


               Be more specific.


               In English.
                    
               I'll fuck your brains out.


               What makes you think I'd go for that
               bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar
               car.


               Because I'm the only person you can't
               control and it kills you.

     Sebastian sneers at her.

                              KATHRYN 
               Do we have a deal?


               No way, that car means everything to
               me.

     She kisses him and licks her tongue over his lips.


                    
               You can put it anywhere.


               Even there?


                    
               It would feel so yummy.

     Sebastian hesitates, then shakes her hand.

                              KATHRYN 
               Happy hunting.



     WE MOVE across the sky looking down at lush greens and
     stately mansions till WE PASS over the ROSEMOND ESTATE.
     Enormous in size. WE SEE two riders on horseback.



     ANGLE ON: The two horseback riders. One, a woman of
     seventy. This is HELEN ROSEMOND, Sebastian's aunt.
     The other rider is a beautiful seventeen year old girl.
     The one and only ANNETTE HARRISON.


               It's a beautiful home you have here
               Mrs. Rosemond.


               Thank you, Annette. Chance Hill has been
               with my family for over sixty years.
               Does your family do much riding?


               My mother and I used to ride a lot,
               before she got sick.


               I'm sorry about that.


               My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his
               farm so I would come over and ride all
               the time.


               I'm familiar with a lot of breeders in
               the mid-west. What's his name?


               Ben Schwarz.


               Schwarz. Jewish?


               German.


               Doesn't ring a bell.

     Annette throws her a concerned look.

                              AUNT HELEN 
               In any event, I want you to consider
               this your home for the time being.


               Thank you. It's so peaceful and quiet
               around here.

     BANG! A shotgun sounds in the distance.

                              ANNETTE 
               What was that?


               Sebastian must be here.

     Aunt Helen gallops down the ridge followed by Annette.



     Sebastian stands holding a shotgun. A groundskeeper,
     FRANKLIN stands by the trap.


               Pull!

     The TARGET soars into the air,

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Die motherfucker!

     He fires the gun, missing the target.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Shit, shit, shit.

     Franklin shakes his head. WE HEAR a cat MEOW. Sebastian
     perks up.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Kitty. Kitty.

     He quietly reloads his rifle. WE HEAR the cat MEOW
     again. Sebastian searches for the cat.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Puss Puss Puss Puss Puss.

     He raises his rifle and takes aim.


               Sebastian!

     He lowers his rifle and turns to SEE Aunt Helen and
     Annette riding over to him. He waves.

     Aunt Helen dismounts from her horse and they hug.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               I've been looking all over for you.
               God, I've missed you.


               I've missed you too. How are your
               parents?


               They're coming back next week. I write
               them everyday.

     She strokes his cheek, lovingly.


               Sebastian, this is Annette Harrison.
               She's going to be staying with me for
               a few weeks.


               I guess that makes two of us. Welcome.

     He extends his hand and they shake.

                              SEBASTIAN 
                    
               Why don't you head in and whip us up
               some of that ice tea of yours? We'll
               take care of the horses.


               Anything for you, my dear.

     Sebastian climbs on Aunt Helen's horse.

                              AUNT HELEN 
               Stay out of trouble you two.


               We will.

     He smiles at Annette and beckons her to follow.



     Sebastian and Annette put the riding gear away.


               So what year are you going into?


               Junior.


               Got a boyfriend back home?


               No.


               Why not?


               I don't know. Relationships seem too
               distracting. I'd rather concentrate on
               my studies.


               You a lesbo?


                    
               No.

     She bends over to pick up the saddle.


               Nice.

     She sighs, disgusted, then turns toward him.


               Are you often this offensive on a first
               encounter?


               I was just being honest. You happen to
               have a nice ass. Sorry.

     She shakes her head and continues with her chore.


               I read your teen beat manifesto.


               You did?


               I must say I found it rather appalling.


               That's a first. Most people praised me
               for it.


               Most people are morons. I mean who are
               you to knock what you've never experienced?


               I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my
               belief that people shouldn't actually
               experience the act of love until they are
               in love and that people our age are too
               immature to be in touch with those
               emotions.


               Oh really?


               Take yourself. You've slept with several
               women. Are you happier because of it?


               How do you know I've been with several
               women?


               A friend wrote me.


                    
               Well maybe you should get to know the
               person before you judge them instead of
               listening to some bullshit gossip.


               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you...
               but you still didn't answer the question.

     An uncomfortable silence falls between them,


               Who the hell is taking the time to write
               letters, spreading this shit about me?


               It's not really important.


               Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're
               not going to be friends.


               Why are you being so dramatic?


               Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm
               trying to deal with them and the last
               thing I need is people spreading shit
               about me.


               Alright, I said I was sorry.
                    
               Can we start over again? I think we've
               gotten off on the wrong foot.

     She approaches him and they shake.

                              ANNETTE 
               Annette Harrison.


               Sebastian Valmont.

     She smiles, but before he releases her hand:

                              SEBASTIAN 
               So tell me, Annette. I'm curious, since
               you've never had sex do you touch
               yourself?

     She whisks her hand away and storms out of the stable.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               What did I say?



     CLOSE ON: A hand stroking the bridge of a cello.


               That's good, that's good.



     Cecile sits in front Of a cello. Next to her sits RONALD
     CLIFFORD, a well-mannered fifteen year old African
     American. Holding his own cello, he is giving her a
     music lesson.

                              RONALD 
               Now let's try the A minor scale.

     Cecile attempts the A minor scale, fucking up badly.

     Kathryn enters and shudders in silence.

                              RONALD 
               Once more, and remember the third note
               is flat.

     Cecile tries again and once again screws up.


               Oh, I suck. I suck.


               Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.

     Cecile takes a deep breath

                              RONALD 
               You're concentrating too much on your
               bowing. Let it flow.

     He stands and sits behind her.

                              RONALD 
               Here, let me help you.

     He places his hand over hers.

                              RONALD 
               Now close your eyes and let's try again.

     She closes her eyes and they repeat the scale. It sounds
     much better. Ronald takes the moment to study Cecile's
     face. It's obvious he's smitten with her.

     ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses
     her face.

     Ronald replaces her other hand and plays a beautiful Bach
     Sonata, with he and Cecile sharing the bowing. He closes
     his eyes as the music takes over him. Now Cecile opens
     her eyes and gazes into his. The feeling is mutual.

     ON KATHRYN: She accidentally bangs her hand onto a table
     which causes a metal tray to fall to the ground.

     Ronald and Cecile look up as Kathryn replaces the tray


               I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
               Your playing was beautiful.

     Ronald quickly stands and moves away from Cecile


               Kathryn, this is Ronald Clifford. He's
               giving me music lessons over the
               summer.

     Ronald approaches and shakes Kathryn's hand.


               Pleased to meet you.


               Likewise I'm sure.


               Ronald is one of the few high school
               students attending Juliard. He's
               composing his first opera.


               It's based on the life of Doctor
               Martin Luther King.


               Doctor King is my favorite.

     Ronald shakes his head, but laughs. Cecile looks at him
     and smiles. Kathryn rolls her eyes.


               I guess our hour's up. Same time
               tomorrow?

     Cecile nods.



     Another nice home in Connecticut. Sebastian's Porsche is
     parked outside.



     A typical teenagers bedroom, expect this one is a shrine
     to Herb Ritts homo-erotic art.

     BLAINE TUTTLE, Oakwood Prep's resident drug-dealer and
     open homosexual, sits at his desk separating pot seeds
     from his stash.

     Sebastian paces behind him.


               Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -


               - none taken -


               - wrote a letter to this chick and saying
               shit about me.


               Any ideas who it could be?


               Blaine, if I knew who it was that person
               wouldn't be alive right now.


               Where did you say she's from?


               Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?


               Greg McConnell.


               The football stud?


               He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be
               surprised if he was your rat.


               It would make sense. McConnell hates me.
               I fingered his girlfriend at the game
               last year.


               I don't think that bothered him.


               What do you mean?


               Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight
               ends on and off the field.


               Are you shitting me?


               I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak
               in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd
               go at it for a while, then as soon as
               he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You
               know -
                    
               "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag.
               I'll kick your ass if you say anything."
                    
               It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're
               gay, deal with it. The only reason why
               I let him continue with his charade is
               because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.


               Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.


               Not anymore. Football team started
               practice last week. He's already called
               me to hook up.


               Really. You think you could arrange a
               little get together with him tonight on
               my behalf?


               Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing
               Spartacus on television tonight.


               Outstanding.


               Don't think it's not going to cost you.


               No problem. Just make sure your front
               door is unlocked. Shall we say the
               "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?

     Sebastian hands Blaine two hundred dollar bills.



     Kathryn and Cecile sit on a blanket. A lavish picnic lies
     around them. Kathryn wears large sunglasses, a scarf and
     a hat to protect her from the sunlight. She sits behind
     Cecile and braids her hair.


               So, rumor has it that you went on a date
               with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very
               nice.


               He's alright.
                    
               He kept talking about this bulimic
               headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.


               Really? Bulimic headcase.


               What a loser she must be.
                    
               Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons
               for Labor Day Weekend.


               That's great.


               You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm
               just scared.


               What are you scared of?


               Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to
               first base with a guy. What do I do?


               Haven't you ever practiced with one of
               your girlfriends?


               Eww. No. That's gross.


               It's not gross. How else do you think
               girls learn? Here turn around and
               face me.

     Cecile turns and faces Kathryn, who removes her glasses.

                              KATHRYN 
               Now close your eyes and wet your lips.


               Are you for real?


               Do you want to learn or not?


               I guess. It still sounds gross.

     Cecile does as instructed. Kathryn leans in and kisses
     her on the mouth.


               See that wasn't so bad.


               It was nothing.


               Let's try it again, only this time I'm
               going to stick my tongue in your
               mouth. When I do that I want you to
               massage my tongue with yours. That's
               what first base is.


                    
               Okay.


               Eyes closed.

     Cecile closes her eyes. Kathryn leans in and kisses her
     again, only this time longer. She continues to kiss her
     then gently pushes her tongue into Cecile's. Cecile does
     as instructed and they start to make out.

     Kathryn eyes look towards the ground where Cecile's hands
     are now clutching the grass. Kathryn smiles and
     continues her seduction.

     She places her hand on Cecile's thigh and moves it under
     her dress. Cecile lets out a soft sigh.

     Kathryn breaks from the kiss. They look at each other
     and smile.

                              KATHRYN 
               Not bad.


               That was cool.


               Maybe you should try it on your friend
               Ronald sometime.


               What are you saying?


               Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about
               you.


               Is it that obvious?

     Kathryn nods.

                              CECILE 
               He sends me letters you know. Love
               letters.


               That's so romantic. Have you
               responded?


               No.


               Well do you like him?


               I don't know.


               Cecile, we just made out in the middle
               of Central Park. You can trust me.


                    
               I do like him. I can't stop thinking
               about him.

     Cecile starts to cry. Kathryn hugs her.

                              CECILE 
               What am I going to do? If my mother
               found out about Ronald she would kill
               me.

     Kathryn grabs her and looks her straight in the eye.


               Listen to me. Your mother must never
               know. Never.


               Okay.


               Did you hide the letters?


               Yes. They're in this antique doll house
               in my room.


               I want you to make me copies of his
               letters and bring them to me.


               Why?


               Cecile if there's one thing I'm great
               at it's love letters. With my help,
               he'll be eating out of the palm of
               your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a
               little get together for the two of you
               at my house.


               You'd do that for me?


               Of course I would. We're friends,
               right?


               Best friends.

     Cecile kisses her on the cheek and hugs Kathryn.



     Little touches of Annette's life 
     adorn the room. Annette is reading  when
     she HEARS singing coming from outside. Unable to
     concentrate, she walks out onto the balcony.



     Annette steps onto the balcony.

     HER P.O.V. - Sebastian lies in a floating pool chair
     sipping a cocktail and listening to his Walkman and
     singing Beethoven's "Ode to Joy" in German.


                    
               Excuse me. Excuse me!


               You talking to me?


               Look, I know this is your house and all,
               but do you think you couid keep it down?
               I'm trying to read.


               What'cha reading?


               The Fountainhead.


               Great book.


                    
               You've read The Fountainhead?


               Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act,
               you know. When Howard Roark makes love
               to Dominique Francon... most romantic
               scene in all of literature.


               Romantic? He rapes her.


               That's a matter of opinion.


               You need help.


               Why don't you come join me for a swim
               and we'll discuss it.


               At this hour? I don't think so.


               Oh come on. Quit acting like a
               geriatric and get in the pool.


               Gee, with an invitation like that how
               could a girl refuse.


               Please.


               Give me a minute. I'll be right down.


               Thank you.

     She re-enters the guest room. Sebastian's cell phone
     RINGS. He answers it.





     Kathryn sits in her bathrobe. One foot soaks in a small
     tub of water while Sook-Hee tends to her other foot.


               Fuck her yet?


               I'm working on it.


               Loser.


               Blow me.


               Call me later.


               Okay.

     She hangs up and lights a cigarette. Sook-Hee accidently
     jabs her toe.


               Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch.


               Sorry.

     Kathryn kicks some water in her face.


               Oops.



     Annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. She sits by the
     pool as Sebastian treads water away from her.


                    
               You know it amazes me that someone as
               bright as you can be so horrible.


               What? Another letter from your friend?


               This is my favorite part.
                    
               Even more treacherous and dangerous than
               he is charming and fascinating. He has
               never taken a single step or spoken a
               single word without some dishonorable
               or criminal intention. Every young girl
               he has successfully pursued has
               regretted it.


               You know you could at least have the
               decency of telling me who's badmouthing
               me so I might have the opportunity to
               confront them face to face. How do you
               know it's not some girl who's pissed
               off at me for breaking up with her?


               I sincerely doubt it.


               Give me the fucking letter.

     Annette smiles and tears the letter up.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Why did you do that?


               The last thing I need is you going into
               my room searching for this while I'm
               away.


                    
               Is that the last thing you need? My
               your clever.

     She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She
     then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece
     bathing suit underneath.


               How's the water?


               Refreshing.

     She dives in the pool and surfaces.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               You're right you know.


               About what?


               About what you said today in the stable.
               I'm not a happy person.


               I never said that.


               You implied it.


               Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard
               time.


               No, it's okay. I mean I look at you
               with all your morals and values and
               well, YOU seem to be happy in your
               choices. I envy you. No bullshit.


                    
               Thank you.


               Seriously, you're amazing. You have
               everything going for you.
                    
               You're smart, you're beautiful, you're
               determined. You're everything I want
               in a girlfriend.


                    
               Shut up.


               I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you
               out.


               Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it
               could never work.


               Why not?


               Because you act like a pig.

     He swims towards her.


               Do you deny that there's an attraction
               between us?


               I don't... I don't want to answer that...
               look we're friends.


               You don't find me cute? Come on, look
               at these muscles.

     He flexes for her. She laughs.


               I'm sorry, but you're not my type.


               Fine. Friends it is. I can live with
               that.

     He extends his arms out for a hug. She moves in and hugs
     him. Her smile turns to a look of horror.


               You're naked.


               It's my house.

     She pushes him off her.


               That's repulsive.


               What's the big deal? We're friends.
               Haven't you ever seen your friends
               naked before?

     Annette climbs out of the pool.


               Get some manners.

     She walks into the house.


               Sorry, I didn't know you were peenaphobic.

     She flips him the bird as she heads into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Oooooo, naughty naughty. Ten Hail
               Mary's for you.
                    
               Good night.



     Sebastian's Porsche is parked outside.



     Sebastian presses his ear to the door.


                    
               Oh baby... oh baby...


               Baby?
                    
               Right on time.



     GREG McCONNELL, All-American star football player for
     Oakwood prep is busy getting his cock sucked by Blaine,
     who lies under the covers.


                    
               Oh God... Oh God, I'm gonna cum. I'm
               gonna cum... I'm gonna...

     The door swings open and Sebastian enters.


               Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy
               shit.


               Jesus!

     Greg throws the covers over his face. Sebastian smiles
     and sits. He lights a cigarette. No movement from under
     the covers.


               Greg, is that you under the covers?


                    
               Get out of here.

     Sebastian stands YANKS the covers off the bed, revealing
     Greg and Blaine.


               Whoa!


               I told you to lock the door.


               I thought I did.


               Look Valmont. This was the first time
               I've ever done something like this. I
               was --


                    
               -- really drunk and blah blah blah
               blah blah.


               Please don't tell anyone. This could
               ruin my career.


               Your career? What about your family?
               Can you imagine the humiliation your
               father's going to feel when he finds
               out his pride and joy is a fudge-
               packer.


               Hey hey hey. Careful Valmont, he's
               not a fudge packer. Cum chugger yes
               but not a fudge packer.


                    
               Please. I'm begging you. I'll do
               anything. Let's just forget the whole
               thing.


               Hmmmmmmm... nah. I can't help you
               there. It's too good to pass up.

     Greg starts to cry.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               After all, it is you who's bad-
               mouthing me to Annette Harrison.


               Annette Harrison? I don't know what
               you're talking about.


               Come on Greg. You're the only one who
               knows her. The truth will save you.


                    
               I swear on my life, I never said a
               word to her about you.


               I think he's telling the truth
               Valmont. Greg couldn't write a
               grocery list let alone a letter.


               Alright, I believe you. Stop crying.
               Your secret's safe with me.

     Greg wipes his eyes.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               However, this whole incident's kind of
               turned me on.

     Sebastian unzips his fly.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               You get my point.

     Greg, completely defeated, crawls off the bed and over to
     Sebastian. Blaine shakes his head and smiles.

     Greg places his hand on Sebastian's thigh when -

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Jesus Christ, I was only kidding.
               What do you think, I'm gay? My God,
               haven't you had enough for tonight.


               Our boy just can't get enough dick.


               You sick son of a bitch.

     Blaine and Sebastian laugh.


               I'll leave you guys alone.
                    
               Score one for the team, Greg.

     Sebastian leaves the room, then re-enters.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Come to think of it, there is
               something you can do for me.



     Annette jogs up a dirt road on her morning run. THIRTY
     YARDS BEHIND HER - a golf cart drives off a meadow and
     lands on the road. Sebastian is driving.

     Annette looks back and scowls. Sebastian catches up to
     her.


               Need a lift?


               No thank you.


               How are you today?


               Give it up.


               Oh right, last night. I guess I owe
               you an apology.


               I'm not going to speak to you till you
               realize that you can't intimidate me.


               I said I was sorry.

     She continues her jog. Sebastian follows alongside.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Have a nice sleep last night?


               It was fine.


               I wish I could say the same for
               myself. I was up thinking about you
               all night.


               I thought we agreed that we were going
               to be friends.


               Yes, well unfortunately I can't just
               switch the "on" button to "off." The
               sad fact of the matter is that you've
               unintentionally rubbed off on me.

     Annette stops running and turns to him.


               And that's a bad thing?


               I'm trying to better myself, but the
               one person who can help me is the same
               one pushing me away.


               I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your
               savior.


               Well try this one on for size. I think
               I'm falling in love with you.


               You don't even know me.


               Don't you believe in love at first sight?


               Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this
               is far from mutual.


               Ouch. Do you think we could spend some
               time together this morning?


               I can't. I'm seeing a friend.


               Who?


               That's none of your business.


               How about tonight?


               I'm busy.


               Doing what?


               That's also none of your business.


               Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I
               win your heart. I'll do anything. I
               can't get you out of my mind.


               You truly want to do something to make
               me happy?


               Yes.


               And you promise to abide by it?


               Without question.


               Alright.
                    
               I want you to leave and go back to
               New York.


               What?


               If that's a problem, then I'll make
               arrangements to stay with some friends.

     Sebastian thinks for a moment. He's pissed.


               I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?


               It's not about being happy. You and I
               can't -

     He shifts the cart into reverse and backs away.



     Annette and Greg walk along the beach and gaze out at the
     ocean.


               He told you he's failing in love
               with you? I've never known him to
               say those words before.


               Really? I thought he said it all
               the time.


               That's not his style. one thing I can
               say about Valmont. He always speaks
               the truth.

     Annette looks lost.

                              GREG 
               What's wrong?


               Nothing.


               Is there a mutual feeling between you
               two?


               No. I mean. I don't know.
                    
               What else do you know about him?


               Not a whole lot. We take some classes
               together. He's got a bad rep, but it's
               mostly bullshit.


               What do you mean?


               Well, a lot of people are jealous cause
               he's loaded.


                    
               I don't know. I've been hearing some
               awful things about him.


               From who?


               I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.

     Greg takes her hand.


               Annette, how long have we known each
               other?


               Forever.


               Now it's my job to look out for you.
               You're like a kid sister to me. Do I
               look like some kind of gossip queen?

     Annette laughs.


               You promise not to say anything?


               On my mother's life.


                    
               Okay...



     Sebastian drives down the highway towards Manhattan. He holds
     his cell phone in one ear.


               That nosey bitch. Are you sure?





     Greg talks on a pay phone, out of Annette's sight.


               Positive.


               Did you do everything I asked you to?


               Yes.


               You told her I never said I love you
               before?


               Yes!


               You told her that people are jealous
               cause I'm loaded?


               Yes!


               And you think she bought it?


               I'm pretty sure she did.


               Pretty sure or sure sure?


               She bought it.


               I'll be in touch.

     Click. The line goes dead.



     Kathryn is sitting in front of the television, scowling.




     Ronald plays Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata" at the piano
     while Cecile listens and sways to the music.




               Enough with the music. Fuck her
               already.

     She throws a magazine at the television. Sebastian bursts
     into the living room.


               You would not believe what--


               Shhh.





               That was beautiful.


               Almost as beautiful as you.

     Cecile blushes. Ronald checks his watch.


               Well, I guess it's getting late.
               Please thank Kathryn for the use of
               her Steinway.


               I'll see you tomorrow.


               Absolutely.

     He approaches her, awkwardly then shakes her hand.


               Idiot!

     ANGLE ON: LIVING ROOM - Kathryn FREEZE FRAMES the image.


               What's wrong with you?


               You ready for this? I've recently
               discovered that our good friend Mrs.
               Caldwell is the one who sent the
               letter to Annette urging her to stay
               away from me.


               Interesting.


               I now plan to devote all my energies to
               destroying the douche bag. Any luck
               corrupting her daughter?


               No.


               Call Cecile up and get her to come over.
               I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.

     She walks over to the "freeze frame" image of Ronald and
     Cecile on the television.


               The plot thickens. It appears that
               Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.


               Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love
               that.


               Not to mention Court Reynolds.
               Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the
               speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.


               What's your plan of attack?


               I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes
               ballistic and ends their relationship.
               Boo hoo.


               But who will they turn to for help?

     Kathryn smiles and sits on Sebastian's lap.


               Cecile is planning to go away with Court
               next week. I'll need you to speed
               up her sexual awakenings.

     Sebastian rubs her shoulders.


               I'm at your service.


               Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.


               Oh sis. You're so tense.

     Sebastian moves his hand down her shirt and under her bra.
     He's met with no resistance.


               I hate when things don't go my way. It
               makes me so horny.


               I hate it too.

     He takes his hand out from her shirt and slides it under her
     skirt.

                              SEBASTIAN 
                    
               Oh baby, your soaking.


               I know.

     She closes her eyes and rubs his crotch. She unzips his fly.

                              KATHRYN 
                    
               Any luck with your girl?


               Moving along quite well.


               Have you succeeded in your task?


               Any day now.


               Well, let me know when you do. Until
               then.

     She takes his hand out from under her pants.

                              KATHRYN 
               No pootie.

     Kathryn smiles.

                              KATHRYN 
               Sorry.



     A meter maid writes a ticket on Sebastian's car when she
     grabs her neck in pain.



     Sebastian closes his window and sets down a bb rifle with
     an infrared scope.


               Goodbye Mister Bond.

     He picks up the phone and dials.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Hi, it's Sebastian. I didn't wake you
               did I?





     Annette sits in bed talking on the other end of the
     phone.


               No, not at all.


               Well, I was just calling to see how
               you're doing.


               I'm... I'm alright.


               How was your date?


               It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.

     There's a moment of uncomfortable silence.


               Well, I was just calling to tell you
               I was thinking about you and I miss
               you. I'll let you go.


               Wait, don't hang up.


               Okay?


               What are you doing?


               Reading.

     He crosses over to his circular bed where two scantily clad
     twins  are licking popsicles.


               What are you reading?


               Of Human Bondage.


               Somerset Maugham.


               Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering
               my situation.


               You're not gonna start that again.

     He takes out a bottle of baby oil and pours it on the
     girls' butts.


               No. I'm through with my childish
               games when it comes to you. Hold on,
               that's my other line.
                    
               Rub.

     They rub the oil on each other then turn to him and
     smile. He clicks the phone back on.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Annette that's my mom calling. Can I
               call you tomorrow?


               Sure. Have a good night.


               I will.






               Of Human Bondage. You're such a
               bullshit artist.


               Shut up, Gretchen. You don't even
               know what it is.


               Duh, it's a book.


               Do you know what it's about?


               Who cares. Books are for fags.


               Books are for fags. I weep for the
               future.



     Establishing shot.



     A SALESWOMAN approaches Kathryn who's checking out an
     assortment of fur coats. The saleswoman holds up a
     beautiful dress.


               Here's something you might like.

     Kathryn examines the label.


               Do you carry any real fur?


               No. All our fur is faux.


               Of course. The animals. How silly of
               me.

     The saleswoman smiles, then walks away. Kathryn sneers
     then looks over at a small child, staring at her.

                              KATHRYN 
                    
               Fuck off.

     She "shoos" the child away, when Mrs. Caldwell
     approaches.


               I got your message and came as quick
               as I could.


               I hope I didn't keep you from
               something.


               Not at all. What's wrong?


               It's Cecile.


               What about her?


               Well... you promise you won't say
               anything to her. We've developed a
               friendship and...


               Kathryn, you have my word. It isn't
               drugs is it?


               It's worse. I think there's something
               going on between Cecile and her music
               teacher.


               Ronald? That's crazy.


               I know. She's so young and he's so -


               Black.

     Kathryn reacts to her remark.


               He's been sending her love letters that
               she hides under her doll house. I
               questioned whether or not to tell you,
               but something like this could destroy
               her reputation at Oakwood and I don't
               want to see her get hurt.

     Kathryn picks out an expensive suit and approaches the sales
     counter.

                              KATHRYN 
               I hope I did the right thing in telling
               you. I'd hate to see Cecile ruin things
               with Court.


               I can't thank you enough.


               You will be discreet about this?


               Absolutely.


               Will that be cash or charge?

     Kathryn looks through her purse.


               Oh poo. I left my credit cards at home.

     Mrs. Caldwell takes out her purse.


               Let me get that for you.


               Oh please. I can't have you do that.


               It's the least I can do.

     Mrs. Caldwell hands the credit card to the saleswoman.
     Kathryn turns to Mrs. Caldwell.


               Thank you.



     Ronald gives Cecile a cello lesson when Mrs. Caldwell
     bursts into the room.


               Who the hell do you think you are?!


               Excuse me.


               I'm paying you to give cello lessons.
               Not to pervert my child.


               Mrs. Caldwell I think you're
               misunderstanding something.


               Is that so?

     Mrs. Caldwell holds up Ronald's letters.

                              MRS. CALDWELL 
               You care to explain this then?

     Ronald and Cecile exchange looks of worry.


               Where did you find those?


               Margarita found them while cleaning
               your room.


               Those are my letters!


               Don't you raise your voice at me. Go
               to your room, now.

     Cecile turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL 
               Now!

     Ronald nods and Cecile runs out of the room. Mrs.
     Caldwell turns to Ronald.

                              MRS. CALDWELL 
               How dare you treat me with such
               disrespect. I got you off the streets
               and this is how you repay me?


               Got me off the streets? I live on
               59th and Park.


               Whatever. You are never to set foot
               in this house again and you are never
               and I mean never to see my daughter
               again. Is that understood?!

     Ronald packs up his sheet music, while Mrs. Caldwell
     waits.


               First of all, maam, I never touched
               your daughter and second, I would like
               to think that in these times someone
               of your status could look beyond
               racial lines.


               Oh don't give me any of that racist
               crap. My husband and I gave money to
               Colin Powell.


                    
               I guess that puts me in my place.
               Thank you for the hospitality Mrs.
               Caldwell. It was a true awakening.

     He storms off.



     Ronald rides down in the elevator.


                    
               Took me off the streets?

     The elevator stops and the doors open. Sebastian and
     Kathryn stand in the doorway, wearing shades. Kathryn
     hands Cecile's letter.



     Ronald sits in a chair and reads Cecile's letter.
     Sebastian and Kathryn watch.


               Wow. I never knew she had these kind
               of feelings.


               You're a lucky guy.


                    
               She really loves me.

     Sebastian and Kathryn roll their eyes.

                              RONALD 
               What do I do?


               What do you do? Tell her you love
               her.


               But I can't even see her. She doesn't
               have her own phone, I don't even know
               her e-mail address.


               Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and
               pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her
               another letter.


               How will I get to her?


               We'll make sure she gets it.


               Why are you being so good to me?


               Because we want to see Cecile happy
               and we know you make her happy.

     She hands Ronald a pen and paper.

                              KATHRYN 
               Now you just march yourself into the
               study and start writing. We'll be there
               to check on you in a minute.

     Ronald leaves the room. Sebastian closes the door while
     Kathryn picks up the phone and dials.


               Who are you calling?


               Cecile.

     Sebastian hangs up the phone.

                              KATHRYN 
               What are you doing?


               Before we go through with this, I just
               want you to be aware of the damage we're
               going to cause.


               I'm aware.

     She picks up the phone and he hangs it up again.


               Are you really? I mean, we've done some
               pretty fucked up shit in our time but
               this... I mean, we're destroying an
               innocent girl. You do realize that.


               What is that? Oh my God, it's your
               conscience.

     She reaches out toward his temple, plucks a handful
     of something, throws it to the ground and STOMPS on
     it.

                              KATHRYN 
               Court Renolds is going down and if you're
               not going to help me, someone else will.


               You amaze me.


               Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you
               to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl
               it's wrong. Well let me tell you
               something, I didn't ask to be a girl.
               Do you think I relish the fact that I
               have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty
               four seven, so I can be considered a
               "laaaady." Do you think I take great
               delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so
               wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child."
               "Kathryn is going to make an excellent
               wife one day."
                    
               I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the
               upper East Side and sometimes I want to
               kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy
               being a part of the weaker sex and for
               that reason everyone around me is going
               to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis
               Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you
               out?

     Sebastian says nothing. Kathryn picks up the phone and
     dials.

                              KATHRYN 
               Hello, Cecile. It's Kathryn. Alright,
               stop crying. I understand. Hold on for
               Sebastian.

     She hands the phone to Sebastian.


               Cecile. Now I need you to listen to me
               very carefully. I have a letter from
               Ronald that he asked me to give to
               you. Now I can't exactly bring it to
               your house, since your mother
               despises me so here's what we're going
               to do.



     The clock reads 1:30. A large collection of antiques
     and stuffed animals line the room and walls. Cecile
     lies in bed, eyes wide open. She crawls out of it,
     dressed in sweats.



     Cecile exits a building and steps into a waiting
     taxi.



     Cecile lies on Sebastian's bed. She finishes the letter
     while Sebastian fiddles with a camera.


               Finished.

     She hands the letter to Sebastian, who looks it over.


               Excellent.


               You think he'll like it?


               He'll love it.

     He points the camera at Cecile and snaps a photo.


               What are you doing?


               Just taking your photo.


               I look terrible.


               Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes
               don't do you justice. Why don't you
               take them off.

     Cecile gasps.


               I'm getting out of here.

     She stands to leave. Sebastian blocks her path.


               I'm sorry that was out of line.


                    
               I want to go home.


               I was just kidding.


                    
               I want to go home.

     He moves toward the phone


               Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom
               and have her come pick you up.


               My mom? Don't call my mom.


               Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't 
               know you're here. In fact, you're
               grounded. Jesus, you could get in a
               shitload of trouble for this.
               I think I should call her anyway.

     Cecile runs over to him, sobbing, and wraps her arms
     around his legs.


               Please please please. I'll do
               anything. Just don't call my mom.


               Cecile, all I want to do is give you a
               kiss.


               And then I can go home?


               Of course. I'm not a monster.

     Cecile breathes a sigh of relief. He pulls her up to her
     feet.


               Just a kiss, right?


               I swear.

     She closes her eyes, then puckers up. Sebastian takes the
     string holding up her sweats and pulls it open.

     Cecile bolts up.


               What are you doing?


               You promised to let me kiss you.


               But -


                    
               I don't want to kiss you here. I want
               to kiss you there.

     Sebastian points to her crotch. She moves her hands to
     her sweats and looks up at him. Sebastian shrugs.

     Cecile pulls the string to her sweats. They fall to the
     floor.



     Mrs. Caldwell enters the room.


               Cecile are you up yet? We're gonna to
               be late for the -

     She notices the bed is empty.

                              MRS. CALDWELL 
               Cecile?

     She walks over the bathroom door and knocks.

                              MRS. CALDWELL 
               Cecile?


               I'm in the bath, mom.


               Well hurry up. I want to be at Mrs.
               Rosemond's before lunch.


               Okay.



     Cecile stands in front of her mirror, crying. She applies
     make-up to several hickeys on her neck. She XXX down
     her shirt and grimaces. She sticks her finger the make-
     up bottle, then puts her hand down her shirt.



     Aunt Helen, Annette, Mrs. Caldwell and Cecile are having
     lunch. Cecile is wearing a turtle neck.


               It was nice of you to invite us up
               for the weekend, Helen.


               More the merrier.
                    
               Is everything alright my dear?


               I'm just not feeling well.

     Sebastian enters carrying his tennis racket.


               Afternoon ladies.

     Cecile is stunned that he's there. Sebastian takes a
     seat at the table.


               I didn't know you'd be here,
               Sebastian.


               I wasn't planning on it, but being
               such a lovely day, why waste it in the
               city. Anyone for tennis?

     He looks at Cecile and strokes the shaft of his racket.

     Cecile stands and rushes into the house.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               What's wrong with her?

     No one knows.

                              MRS. CALDWELL 
               Would you excuse me for a minute?

     Mrs. Caldwell follows her into the house.


                    
               I hope she's alright.


               I better go check on them.

     Aunt Helen stands and enters the house.


               Alone again.
                    
               What are you up to today?


               I'm doing some volunteer work.


               Need any company?


               You? Volunteer? I don't think so.


               I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm
               trying to change here. You could be
               supportive.


                    
               Okay.


               Babe, you're looking at the next Mother
               Teresa.

     Annette shakes her head and laughs.



     Cecile talks on the phone.


               Please. I need you. I don't know what
               to do. You're the only one I can talk
               to.



     Kathryn listens on the other end of the conversation.


               I'll be there in a few hours.

     She hangs up the phone and smiles.



     Establishing shot.



     A NURSE escorts Sebastian and Annette down the hall.


               It's really nice when the young people
               help out. Most of our patients don't
               have any family nearby.

     They stop at a door and open it. An OLD MAN sits in his
     hospital bed.

                              NURSE 
               Mister Gottlieb, we have a visitor for
               you.

     Sebastian starts to enter the room, when the nurse stops
     him.

                              NURSE 
               Actually Sebastian, you're going to be
               spending the hour with Mrs. Sugarman.

     The Nurse escorts an unhappy Sebastian down the
     hall. Annette waves "bye bye" to him.



     Annette sits by Mister Gottlieb's bed and reads from a book
     of poetry.



     A senile MRS. SUGARMAN sits in bed, while Sebastian does
     a newspaper crossword puzzle and ignores her. He smokes
     a cigarette and flicks the ash into her bedpan which lies
     next to her on the bed.


               Did I ever tell you the time when my
               late husband sent me -


               Yes, you already did.


               I did?

     Sebastian never takes his eyes off the paper.


               Right after we played backgammon.


               We played backgammon?


               Uh huh. You beat me three times.


               I did?


               Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.


               Excuse me?

     He turns to her and extinguishes his cigarette.


               I said, do you want some water?


               Oh... no thank you...

     There's a knock at the door.


               Come in.

     Annette and the nurse enter.


               How we doing in here?


               I won three games of backgammon.

     Sebastian smiles at Annette, who smiles back.



     Sebastian and Annette drive towards the estate.


               It's weird. I actually feel good about
               myself. Can we do this again next week?


               Oh please.


               What?


               "I actually feel good about myself?"


               I do.


               You must take me for a real idiot.


               I don't.


               You're going to tell me that you had a
               good time with the old lady.


               I did. We played three games of backgammon
               and...

     She throws him a look.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Alright. I was bored out of my fucking
               mind. I hate doing charity.


               That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad
               person.


               Yes it does.


               No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being
               honest with me.


                    
               I can't win with you.


               It's not about winning. You know what
               your problem is? You take yourself way
               too seriously.


               I do not.


               Lighten up.


               I am lighten. Can we drop this?


               Fine.

     They drive on in silence. A smile comes over Annette's
     face. She turns to him, crosses her eyes and makes a
     face. Sebastian looks over.


               What are you doing? Stop it, it's
               distracting.

     She holds the face. Sebastian starts to laugh.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Cut it out.

     He continues to laugh. She stops making the face.


               Oh dear, are you actually laughing?


               No.


               No?

     She makes the face again. He laughs.


               Stop that.

     She laughs with him.


               There's hope for you, yet.

     She reaches out and holds his hand. He squeezes it.



     Cecile lies in the bed. There's a knock on the door.


               Who is it?


               It's Kathryn.

     Cecile bolts up and unlocks the door. Kathryn stands
     there with a worried look on her face.

                              KATHRYN 
               Are you okay?


               No.

     Kathryn enters and locks the door behind her. Cecile is
     crying.


               Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.


               Something awful happened last night.


               What do you mean?!


               I... I don't think you want to know.


               Cecile, you have to tell me.


               It involves your brother. He... took
               advantage of me.


               Does your mother know?


               If she knew, she'd kill me. It
               happened at your house last night.


               Why didn't you do something?


               I don't know.


               So, let me get this straight. You
               came over to our house late last night
               and he forced intercourse on you.


               Well... not exactly.


               He made you give him a blow job.


               No.


               Well what then?

     Cecile waits a moment, then whispers in her ear.

                              KATHRYN 
               He ate you out?


               If that's what you call it.


               Cecile, I think you're going to have
               a hard time crying rape if that's all
               he did.


               What do I do then?


               Well did you like it?


               Well... I don't know - it was weird.
               At first it felt icky, then it felt
               kind of okay. Then, I started getting
               really hot and then I started shaking
               and then like, I don't t know... it
               felt like an explosion, but a good one.

     Kathryn laughs.


               Cecile, you had an orgasm.


               I did?


               I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a
               woman.


               I am?

     Kathryn nods. Cecile embraces her, happy.


               Now listen. Now that you're on your
               way, it would be stupid of you to stop.
               Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him
               instruct you.


               I don't love him. I love Ronald.


               So? Don't you want to make Ronald a
               happy pappy? Practice makes perfect,
               Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as
               many people as possible.


               But that would make me a slut.
                    
               Wouldn't it?


               Cecile, everybody does it. It's just
               that nobody talks about it.

     Cecile takes the information in.


               It's like a secret society.


               That's one way of looking at it.


               Cool.



     Annette sits on the grass reading Gabriel Garcia
     Marquez's Love In The Time Of Cholera. She puts the book
     down and wipes a tear from her eye.



     Sebastian peers out his window with a pair of binoculars.
     Kathryn enters his room.


               I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I
               don't think she'll be giving you
               anymore problems.


               Yippy.


               Who are you spying on?


               Take a look for yourself.

     He hands the binoculars to Kathryn, who looks out the
     window.


               That her?


               Yeah.


               Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.
                    
               Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset
               by the big bad book.

     Sebastian grabs the binoculars from her.


               Shut up.


               What's your problem?


               Nothing.


               She's really getting to you, isn't
               she?


               If you must know, yes. I don't know
               what to do. I can't stand that holier
               than thou bullshit and yet, I'm
               completely infatuated with her.
                    
               She made me laugh.


               And that's why you're losing your bet?


               I'm not losing the bet. It's just
               taking longer than I expected.


               Do you mind if I take my new Porsche
               for a ride?


               Kathryn, the only thing you're going to
               be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse
               me, I have some work to do.

     He storms out of the room.



     Sebastian walks over to Annette, who continues to read her
     book. She notices him and sets the book down.


               Am I bothering you?


               Not at all. Have a seat.

     He sits down next to her.


               Don't tell me you finished The
               Fountainhead already?

     She nods. He points to her book.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Great book. What's the guy's name,
               Florentino...


               Florentino Ariza.

     Sebastian sticks his hand in his pocket and fiddles
     around.


               My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend
               of Florentino.


               Who's Monsieur Philipe?


               You don't know Monsieur Philipe?

     Sebastian takes out a SOCK PUPPET.

                              SEBASTIAN 
                    
               Bonjour mademoiselle.


                    
               Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.


                    
               You are very pretty. I would like to
               kiss you.

     The puppet kisses her on the cheek.

                              SEBASTIAN 
                    
               Oooo, that felt good.


               Thank you.

     He kisses her on the cheek.


                    
               That felt good too. I will kiss you
               all over.

     The puppet attacks a laughing Annette. She playfully
     grabs Sebastian and starts to tickle him. Sebastian
     tickles her back.

     They roll around on the ground until Sebastian lands on
     top of her. A moment of tense silence passes and
     Sebastian kisses her. The kissing intensifies until she
     pushes him off her.

     Sebastian stands.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               I'm sorry about that.


               I am too.

     He paces for a moment and his mood turns to anger.


               You know what? I don't take it back.


               Why are you doing this?


               Because I'm in love with you.


               I thought you said we were going to be
               friends.


               I can't handle it. I can't keep my
               feelings bottled up like you. Can you
               honestly tell me that you feel nothing
               for me? ... Tell me!


               I have feelings for you.


               Then what's wrong? I love you Annette.
               It's not like you have a husband,
               unless your married to Jesus.


               That's not fair.


               Why can't we be together?

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.


               You really want to know?


               Yes.


               It's because I don't trust myself with
               you.
                    
               I took a vow and because of you I'm
               tempted to break it. Don't destroy that
               for me. Please.

     She hurries off.



     Sebastian enters the room and slams the door behind him.


                    
               Shit.

     He hears the shower running from the bathroom.



     Sebastian enters the room. Cecile sticks her head out
     from the shower curtain.


               Want to join me?


                    
               Some other time, Cecile.

     He leaves the room. Cecile looks confused. A moment
     passes and Sebastian re-enters taking off his clothes.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               What am I, an idiot?

     Cecile smiles.



     Sebastian and Cecile lie in bed. Sebastian smokes a
     cigarette and writes in his journal.


               Am I suppose to be this sore?


               For the first time, yes. It'll pass.

     A moment of silence.


               I like it better when I'm on top.


               Cecile. This is what I like to call
               quiet time. This is time when we
               reflect on what we've done.


               I'm sorry.

     She looks at the troubled expression on Sebastian's face.

                              CECILE 
               Something's bothering you?


               You think?


               Is it me?


               No, you were fine.

     SEBASTIAN'S P.O.V. - He looks out on the balcony, where
     Kathryn is eavesdropping. They make eye contact and she
     waves.


               It's that girl, Annette.

     He stands and walks over to the balcony, where he closes
     the blinds.

                              CECILE 
               You love her, don't you? It's okay.
               I don't love you either. I love Ronald.


               I'm getting out of here.

     Sebastian heads to the bathroom.


               Where are you going?


               I'm taking a shower.


               Need any company?


               No.


               Want a blow job?


               Good night Cecile.


                    
               Prude.



     Annette is reading in bed. There's a knock on the door.


               Come in.

     Sebastian enters the room.


               I just came to say goodbye.


               Where are you going?


               Back to the city. I may take off to
               Europe for the rest of the summer. I
               just can't handle it around here.


               I think that's for the best.


               Good for you.


               Sebastian, please. I don't want us to
               end on bad terms.


               Well, I'm afraid you don't have a
               choice in the matter. You make me
               sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't
               associate with hypocrites.

     Annette's eyes well up with tears.


               How am I a hypocrite?


               Oh please Annette. You spend all your
               time preaching about waiting for love.
               Well here it is. Right in front of you,
               but you're going to turn your back on
               it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age
               where we can get married. If we were,
               I'd propose, but that's not going to
               happen. So I guess we're just fucked.
               I'll move on, but you... you're going
               to have to live with yourself knowing
               you've turned your back on love. And
               that makes you a hypocrite.

     Sebastian heads to the door.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Have a nice life.

     Annette races toward him and throws her arms around him.


                    
               Please don't go.


               Get off me.

     She kisses him passionately.


               I... I want you.

     Sebastian embraces her and draws her over to the bed.

     She lies down and starts to unbutton her dress. Sebastian
     stands over her watches her. Her crying does not let up
     as she continues to undress.

     Sebastian stands, stunned and watches her.


               I'm sorry, I can't.

     A pained look crosses her face. Sebastian leaves the
     room and closes the door.



     Sebastian closes the door and leans against it.


               Shit.

     He wipes his eyes, which are starting to water. He goes
     over to a mirror at looks at himself.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Get it together you pussy.

     A stern look comes over his face. He smiles, then walks
     away.



     A cab pulls up to the house. The front door opens and a
     crying Annette quickly leaves the house and climbs into
     the cab. She closes the door and the cab pulls away from
     the house. WE PAN up to a second story window where
     Kathryn is looking down and smiling.



     Sebastian lies sleeping in his bed. His journal lies
     beside him. A FEATHER tickles his nose. He stirs awake
     and looks up to see Kathryn staring down at him.


               Morning!


                    
               Morning.


               So? How'd it go last night?


               With who?


               Well I know how it went with Cecile.
               She won't shut up about it. How'd it
               go with Mrs. Jesus?

     Sebastian sits up in bed.


               If your asking if I nailed her the
               answer is no.


               She shot you down.


               Exactly the opposite.


               So what went wrong?


               I don't know. She was lying on the bed,
               ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I
               was... I just didn't feel right about
               it.


               You're telling me you had the chance to
               fuck her and you didn't. God are you a
               chump.


               A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to
               be rectified.

     He climbs out of bed and puts on his robe. He starts out
     the door, when -


               If you're heading towards her room, you
               won't find her.


               Where is she?


               You don't know?
                    
               She left thirty minutes ago.


               Where'd she go?


               She wouldn't say. She apologized to
               your aunt and told her she was going
               to stay with some friends.
                    
               You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has
               come to her senses and she will never
               go near you again.

     Sebastian throws off the robe and starts to dress.


               We'll see about that.



     A shrine to hot babes, who's posters adorn the walls. Greg
     is busy dumping muscle magazines, several issues of Teen
     Beat and some Musical Theater CDs into a trash bag when the
     phone rings. He answers it.


               Hello.





     Sebastian is talking on his cell phone.


               Is she with you?


               Who is this?


               Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?


               No.


               Where is she?!


               I don't know. Why don't you leave her
               alone.


               McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in
               two seconds if you don't tell me where
               she is.


               I told you I don't know.


               One.


               Alright. She's staying with some
               friends of her parents. The O'Sheas.
               She caught the train twenty minutes ago
               into Grand Central.


               Grand Central. You better not be
               fucking with me cause it's your ass on
               the line.

     Sebastian clicks off his cell phone.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Motherfucker.

     He bangs on his dashboard.



     The Porsche weaves in and out of traffic on it's way to
     the city.



     A group of passengers exit the train. Annette is among
     them. She stops when she SEES -

     Sebastian, standing in the distance.

     Annette stops in her tracks. She drops her bag, rushes
     over to him and embraces him. Sebastian's cruel demeanor
     drops, when he realizes how happy she is to see him. He
     looks her in the eyes and smiles. They kiss.



     Sebastian carries a laughing Annette into the room. They
     continue to kiss and he carries her over to the table.

     He sets her down and accidentally knocks over a lamp.


               Ooops.

     They both laugh. They kiss some more, then start to
     unbutton each other's clothes. Sebastian struggles with
     her pants' button.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Fuck this.

     He picks her up again and moves to the bed. They
     collapse on the bed and he accidently falls off it.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Suave.

     Annette cracks up. Sebastian reaches up and YANKS her
     down on top of him. They both laugh, then kiss.



     Establishing shot



     Annette sits on the windowsill watching Sebastian as he
     sleeps. He slowly starts to wake and looks at her.


               Hi.


               Hi.

     She walks over to him and kisses him.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               You alright?


               I'm fine. I have to get going to my
               friends' house.
                    
               Was it --


               It was perfect.

     She smiles and holds her hand out. He takes her hand in
     his.



     Annette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the
     hall passing a mirror on the wall. In the mirror's
     REFLECTION is Kathryn, looking very angry.



     Establishing shot.



     Sook-Hee carries a bundle of folded laundry down the
     hall. Sebastian enters the hallway from his bedroom. He
     grabs her.


               You work way to hard. Here.
                    
               Take the day off. Merry Christmas.

     Sook-Hee smiles and moves on. Sebastian continues down
     the hall. He passes Kathryn's door and hear noises.


               Slower.

     Sebastian leans against the door.


               A little to the left. Look, pretend
               like you're writing the alphabet.
               A... B... mmm, stay on B.

     Sebastian knocks on the door.


               One second.

     Sebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from
     inside the bedroom.


               Come in.



     Sebastian enters the room, to find Kathryn lying in bed,
     wearing only her bathrobe.


               Bad time?


               Kind of.


               Well, you obviously wanted me to
               witness your little adventure or else
               you wouldn't have invited me in.

     Sebastian walks toward the closet.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Who is our little friend so
               inexperienced that you have to resort
               to the alphabet game?

     He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there
     covering his genitals with his hands.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Well, well, well.


               It's not what it seems like.

     Ronald picks up his clothes. As he leaves:


               Say hi to Cecile.

     Ronald's head drops as he closes the door behind him.


                    
               Call me.

     Sebastian throws Kathryn a look.

                              KATHRYN 
               You can't have all the fun.

     Sebastian sits on the bed.

                              KATHRYN 
               You seem to be in a good mood.


               I am.

     A big grin appears on Sebastian's face


               You didn't?


               Oh yes.


               Tell me all the details.


               It was... Fantastic.


               Oh come on. For her first time?


               I know. That's the amazing part of
               it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du
               Soleil acrobatics, just standard
               missionary stuff, but it was... ah
               forget it. I'm going to sound like a
               Hallmark card.


               No, tell me.


               It was... it was like the emotional
               part outweighed the physical part.


               Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear
               the birds chirping.


               Mock, mock, mock.

     She places her hand on his crotch.


               So I assume you've come here to make
               some arrangements.

     Sebastian stands.


               Some other time.


               Excuse me?


               I'm not in the mood.


               And that's why you're leaving?


               It clearly is why.


               I want to fuck.


               And I don't.

     He leaves and slams the door behind him.



     Sebastian talks on the phone.


               I'll pick you up in an hour. I love
               you too.

     He hangs up the phone. Kathryn stands in the doorway.


               Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.


               No, I'm not.


               P-whipped, p-whipped.


               What's wrong with you? Why are you
               acting this way?

     Kathryn starts to cry.


               I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're
               in love with her. You don't love me
               anymore.


               Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a
               contest.


               At first it was, but now it's become
               something bigger.


               Kathryn, you know I love you. I've
               always loved you.


               Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.


               I can't believe you're reacting this
               way. You're just saying this because
               you lost the bet.


               Is that what you think?

     He nods. Kathryn sits down on his bed. She slips her
     underwear off from under her bathrobe and tosses it
     aside, spreading her legs.

                              KATHRYN 
               Alright, come on, let's get it over
               with. But mark my words, this is the
               only time it'll happen.

     She picks up the phone.

                              KATHRYN 
               Whenever you're ready. Just stick it in
               me. While you're doing that I'm gonna
               make some phone calls.


               That's not fair. You're taking all the
               fun out of it.


               Then do me a favor and get rid of her.
               If not for me, then do it for you.
               Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's
               turned you into jelly. What do you want
               to be, one of those losers who walk
               down the halls holding hands and
               smiling. People used to respect you.
               They feared you and now you're going to
               throw that all away.

     Sebastian stares at her, lost in thought.

                              KATHRYN 
               Poor Sebastian. He used to be cool, but
               now he's just another love-struck
               faggot. One of the many.



     A taxi drives down the street.



     Kathryn and Sebastian sit in the back seat. Her arm is
     around his. Sebastian looks nervous.


               Why so nervous?


               I've never done this before.


               How have you dumped girls in the past?


               Screening calls. Any suggestions?


               I knew this guy last summer in the
               Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the
               time were madly in love with each
               other. But she had this huge weight
               problem. His friends taunted him
               mercilessly about it. You know, "How
               do you breathe when she sits on your
               face?" "It's embarrassing for you to
               be seen with her." Finally he couldn't
               take it anymore and decided to dump
               her. She flipped and he went on the
               defensive. I distinctly remember him
               saying the same thing over and over
               again. "I'm completely fucked up."
               "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm
               completely fucked up."
                    
               Poor fatty never had a chance.



     The cab pulls up to the curb. Sebastian gets out and
     heads into the building. Kathryn leans out the window.


               Don't be weak.

     The cab drives off.



     Sebastian rings the doorbell. A woman 
     answers the door.


               Hi. Is Annette at home?


               You must be Sebastian. I've heard such
               nice things about you.

     He smiles.

                              MRS. O'SHEA 
                    
               Annette.
                    
               Come on in.



     Sebastian closes the door behind him. Annette enters the
     room.


               Hi.


               Hi.


               Well, I'm going to head back to the
               kitchen. You two have fun.

     Mrs. O'Shea mouths "He's cute" to Annette. Annette
     smiles and nods. Mrs. O'Shea leaves the room.


               Would you like a tour?


               Sure.

     She takes his hand and leads him down the hall.



     They enter a guest room.


               And this is my room.

     She closes the door behind them. She smiles and kisses
     him.

                              ANNETTE 
               You think we can be quiet?

     She embraces him. Sebastian remains lifeless.


               This isn't working out for me anymore.


                    
               Yeah, me neither.

     She looks him in the eye and can tell he's not joking.

                              ANNETTE 
               What's wrong?


               It's not you, it's me. I'm completely
               fucked up.


               What are you saying?


               Why aren't you understanding?


               I love you.


               I know. I wish I felt the same.
               Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think
               it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm
               completely fucked up.

     Annette bursts into tears.


               Why are you trying to hurt me?


               I'm just being honest. I just wanted to
               see what you were like in bed.

     She attacks him but he grabs her hands and fends her off.
     He pushes her against the wall and covers her mouth with
     his hand.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Shh! Shh! I don't think Mrs. O'Shea
               would appreciate you acting like a
               total psychopath.

     She slinks to the ground and continues to sob.


               You don't know how to love.


               You don't even know me. The fact of the
               matter is there is some one I love.
               She's smarter, prettier... you don't
               even compare to her. The only reason I
               am here is because she wants us to be
               exclusive.


               But you knew this was important to me.


               What, your virginity? Well that's over
               now.

     Annette clutches her stomach and continues to sob. He moves
     towards her.


               Please go.

     He opens the door.


               Sorry. I'm completely fucked up.

     He leaves and closes the door behind him. Annette
     continues to sob.



     A cab driver carries several shopping bags out of a cab.



     Kathryn walks down the hallway and enters her room.



     The room is dark. Kathryn flips on the light.


               Jesus.

     Sebastian is sitting in a chair, wearing his shades,
     journal in hand.


               A little melodramatic, don't you think.


               I have a flair for drama.


               Mind if I ask what you're doing in my
               room?


               You wanted an answer to your question.


               Annette?

     He takes off his glasses. We can tell he has been
     crying.


               Devastated beyond repair. I doubt
               she'll ever trust a man again.


               Well done.

     He holds up a bottle of champagne.


               I thought we should celebrate.


               I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm
               expecting some company.


               Ronald?


               Not that it's any of your business but
               yes.

     Sebastian holds up a letter.


               From Ronald.

     Kathryn takes the letter.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               I haven't had a chance to read it, but
               I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah
               yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me.
               Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be
               friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera."
               You see, I expected your sort of
               bullshit so I took the liberty of
               phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now
               they're having a little get together
               in my love shack at the Grand Central
               Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile
               over you, but I promised him I would
               see you through your crisis.


               Well done.


               Thank you. Now, where were we?

     POP goes the champagne cork.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Oh yeah, the celebration.

     He reaches down and picks up two glasses. He fills them
     and hands one to Kathryn.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               What shall we toast to?


               To my triumph, of course.


               Not my choice of toast, but it's your
               call. To your triumph over Annette.

     Kathryn giggles.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               What's so funny?


               Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her.
               It's over you.


               Come again?


               You were very much in love with her and
               you're still in love with her. But it
               amused me to make you ashamed of it.
               You gave up on the first person you
               ever loved because I called you names.
               Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that
               you chose me over her, but please
               understand, I never loved you,
               Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little
               toy I play with. And now you've
               completely blown it with her. I think
               that's the saddest thing I've ever
               heard.
                    
               Cheers.

     She clicks his glass and drinks. Sebastian doesn't
     drink. He looks ill.


               In any event, you still owe me my
               reward.


               I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't
               fuck losers.

     Sebastian slaps her across the face.

                              KATHRYN 
               You motherfucker!

     She grabs him and starts throwing wild punches. They
     fall to the ground.

                              KATHRYN 
               Nobody hits me.


               Calm down.

     He rolls on top of her and pins her to the ground.


               Get off me!


               Will you calm down?


               Fine! Get off me!

     He stands and gives her a hand up. They both catch their
     breaths.


               I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.


               I accept. Now get out.


               Get out? We had an arrangement.


               Didn't you hear what I said?


               I don't care what you said, we had an
               agreement. You've slept with half of
               the borough so don't tell me you're
               being choosy.


                    
               Get out!


               I'm giving you to the count of three to
               plop your ass down on the bed.


               And if I don't?


               Then I will consider it a declaration
               of war. One. Two... three.


               I think you have your answer.


               War it is.

     He grabs his journal, leaves and SLAMS the door behind
     him.



     Sebastian paces while talking on the phone.


               It's desperate that I talk to her.


               I've already told you, she's not home.


               Well please leave a message that I
               called.


               I'll do that.

     He hangs up the phone and THROWS it into a mirror, which



               Shit.

     He collapses on his bed and buries his face in his hands.
     Exhausted he looks up and sees his journal lying on the
     floor. He picks it up and flips through it.



     Sebastian walks down the street carrying a small package.
     He enters an apartment building.



     Sebastian rings the doorbell. Mrs. O'Shea answers the
     door.


               What do you want?


               I need to talk to Annette.


               She's not here.


               Do you know where she is?


               She's out.


               Do you know when she'll be back?


               Later. Listen, we're entertaining
               some guests so -


               Annette! Annette!


               Young man, I already told you she's
               not here.


               Fine. Could you please see that she
               gets this.

     He hands her the package.


               I'll do that.


               It's really important.


               I understand. Good night.

     She closes the door.



     Mrs O'Shea turns away from the door towards Annette,
     who stands in the hallway.



     Kathryn sits in a chair doing her nails. She checks her
     watch, takes a moment and makes herself upset. She picks
     up the phone and dials.





     Ronald is sleeping. The phone rings. He awakens and
     answers it.


               Hello.


                    
               Ronald?


               Yeah?


               It's Kathryn.

     Ronald sits up, nervous.


               Hi Kathryn. Is everything okay?


               No.

     She cries.


               What's wrong?


               It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.


               What do you mean?


               I think he's high on drugs. He hit me,
               then took off. I'm afraid to be alone.
               Please come over.


               I'll be right there.

     He hangs up the phone and grabs his pants





     Kathryn hangs up the phone. She instantly becomes calm and
     returns to doing her nails.



     Annette sits and stares at Sebastian's package.

     She picks it up and opens it. She takes out a journal
     and a letter. She opens the letter and reads it.


               Dear Annette. Thank you for reading
               this letter. I don't know what I can
               possibly say to rectify the harm I have
               caused you. For once in my life I'm at
               a loss for words.



     Sebastian sits at his desk, writing the letter.


               The truth of the matter is that being
               with you was the only time I have ever
               been happy. My whole life has been a
               joke. I prided myself on taking joy in
               others' misery.



     Sebastian walks the streets of New York. He seems sad
     and lonely.


               Well, it finally backfired. I succeeded
               in hurting the first person I loved. I
               wish more than anything I could take it
               back, but I guess that's not possible.



     Annette continues to read the letter.


               Enclosed is my most prized possession...
               my journal. For a long time I
               considered it my trophy. A sordid
               collection of my conquests. If you
               really want to know the truth, then
               please read it. No more lies.



     We PAN down the side of the building to the ground.
     Sebastian lies against the building waiting for Annette
     to return.


               A car is picking me up tomorrow and
               taking me to Martha's Vineyard, where
               we have a summer home. Nothing would
               make me happier than if you joined me.
               I'm a fucking wreck without you. If
               you're interested please meet me
               outside my building at nine. If not, I
               understand. Love, Sebastian.



     Ronald sits and listens as a grieving Kathryn tells her
     story.


               And when I confronted him about his
               affair with Cecile he told me it was
               none of my business. Then when I said
               "Well what about Ronald," he said you
               were nothing more than a stupid... the
               n word and that you deserved what you
               got...


               And this happened before you and I
               hooked up?


               It's been going on for a while.
                    
               Then he called me a disgrace to our
               family and that's when he hit me.


               Racist piece of shit.


               I'd be careful if I were you. God knows
               what he's up to.


               He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass
               in.


               Will you stay here for the night? You
               can leave in the morning. That's when
               my parents get back and --


               Don't worry about it. I'll stay.

     Kathryn hugs him.


               Thanks Ronald. You're a good friend.



     A STREET CLEANING MACHINE drives past the apartment



     Sebastian lies sleeping on a sofa in the lobby. The
     NIGHT DOORMAN taps him awake.


               What time is it?


               Eight o'clock. You got to go.


               Did she show up?


               Nope.


               Do you mind if I check upstairs?


               I can't have you do that, nor can I
               have you hanging around the lobby all
               day.


               I understand. Thanks for letting me
               crash here.


               Don't worry about it.

     Sebastian stands and staggers out of the building.



     Ronald walks out of the building and heads toward the
     corner.

     He stops when he SEES - Sebastian crossing the street.


                    
               Son of a bitch.

     Sebastian walks toward Ronald, who blocks his path.

                              RONALD 
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up at Ronald.


                    
               Hey Ronald.


               It seems that you and I have some
               talking to do.


               Can we do it later. I've had a really
               bad night and -

     Ronald SHOVES Sebastian.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               What's your problem?


               Where the hell do you come off hitting
               women?


               What are you talking about?


               Kathryn. Did you hit her?


               Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?


               Did you hit her?


               Ronald, you don't know what you're
               talking about.


               Don't know what I'm talking about? I
               know that you fucked Cecile.

     Sebastian says nothing.

                              RONALD 
               It's true, isn't it?


               Ronald, I'm sorry.


               You bastard!

     Ronald TACKLES Sebastian to the ground. Ronald lands on
     top of him and hits in the mouth.

                              RONALD 
               I trusted you!

     Ronald hits him again. Blood pours out of Sebastian's
     mouth. Sebastian is dazed. Ronald grabs him by the
     collar.

                              RONALD 
               I trusted you!

     Sebastian takes a moment to catch his breath.


               Fuck you.

     He knees Ronald in the groin. Ronald screams in pain and
     falls over. Sebastian climbs to his feet.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Why don't you give me a chance to
               explain.

     Sebastian kicks him in the ass. Ronald falls over.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Don't you get it? We were all part of
               her game.

     Sebastian pins him to the ground. Ronald struggles.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               I'm gonna let you up, but you have to
               give me a chance to explain. Understood?

     Ronald nods. Sebastian releases him and Ronald catches
     his breath. Sebastian looks up and SEES -

     Annette, standing across the street, witnessing the
     event.

                              SEBASTIAN 
               Annette!

     Sebastian stands and races over to her, blindly crossing
     the street.

     Annette notices a speeding cab and -


                    
               Sebastian!

     Sebastian looks up just as -- WHAM! The taxi HITS him
     dead on, sending him flying over the car and onto the
     street.

     Annette SCREAMS. The cab SKIDS to a stop. Annette runs
     into the street and over to Sebastian, who lies in shock,
     He sees her and grabs her hand. She starts to cry.


               I'm okay. I'm okay.

     Ronald and the Cab driver run over to them.


               Get an ambulance!

     The cab driver races back to his car. Sebastian looks up
     at Annette.

                              ANNETTE 
               We're getting you to a hospital.

     Sebastian nods.


               Holy shit.

                              ANNETTE 
               You're gonna be fine.

     Sebastian nods.


               I'm sorry.

                              ANNETTE 
               It's alright.


               I'm okay. Everything's good.





     Blaine, twenty high-school girls and several friends of
     the family are dressed in black, making polite conversation
     and consoling Sebastian's parents and his Aunt Helen.

     Mrs. Caldwell stands in the corner with Cecile and her
     husband, MR. CALDWELL.


               Sad, sad, sad. To think of the
               opportunities that boy had. This should
               be a lesson to us all that our children
               need constant supervision.

     She puts her arm around Cecile.


               It's all about quality time.



     Annette enters Sebastian's room, now cleaned up. She
     walks around the room, taking it in, then approaches the
     window. She stares out of it for a moment.


               He loved that view.

     Annette turns and sees Kathryn at the door. She enters
     the room.


               I can see why.

     Kathryn extends her hand.


               I'm Kathryn.


               Annette Harrison.

     They shake.


               Have we met?


               I don't think so.


               Did you know Sebastian well?


               You might say that.


               Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your
               father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.


               That's right.


               I'm sure you're going to love it there.

     Annette nods.


               Are you okay?


               I'll be fine.


                    
               Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just
               came in here to get something of mine.

     Kathryn walks over to Sebastian's desk and takes the keys
     to his Porsche. She goes to leave, when she turns back to
     Annette.

                              KATHRYN 
               You sure you're going to be alright?
               I'm here if you need a friend.


               Thank you.


               Look, I know this sounds corny, but
               whenever I feel like I can't go on I...
                    
               turn to Jesus and he helps me through
               the problem. Call me an anachronism,
               but -


               Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.


               Excuse me?


               You heard me.


               Who the hell do you think you are
               coming into my house and saying those
               things to me. My brother is dead, have
               some respect.


               Kathryn, I know all about you and
               Sebastian.


               Sebastian was a pathological liar. I
               wouldn't believe a word he -


               I have his journal.


               You what?


               His journal. He sent it to me the day
               before he died. Everything about you is
               in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs,
               the menages, your bout with bulimia,
               the affair you had with your guidance
               counselor and how he gave you... eww.
               Let's see, then there's your coke
               problem... You still keep it in your
               crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.


               You didn't show it to anybody?


               Actually, I was planning on running
               down to Kinkos. Do you think you could
               give me ride?


               You can't do this to me. It could ruin
               me.


                    
               I know.

     Kathryn starts to cry.

                              ANNETTE 
               Kathryn, please. Crying? Didn't you
               once say that crying is a sign of
               weakness? I'm very disappointed in you.

     Kathryn continues to sob.

                              ANNETTE 
               Alright, stop crying. There's a bright
               side to this you know.

     Annette puts a comforting arm around her.

                              ANNETTE 
               You're going to be my pet project next
               year. You're going to do what I tell
               you to do, wear what I tell you to
               wear. You're going to befriend the
               unpopular, sleep with the insecure.
               Think of the social ramifications it
               will cause. You and I are going to turn
               this school around. And do you know why
               you're going to do it?
                    
               Cause your ass is mine.

     Annette grabs Kathryn by the face, KISSES her forcefully
     on the mouth, then shoves her back. Kathryn looks at her
     in horror.

                              ANNETTE 
               We'll be in touch.

     She winks at Kathryn then leaves.

     CLOSE ON: Kathryn. She sits down on Sebastian's bed,
     utterly defeated.

                              ANNETTE 
               Forgot something.

     Annette steps back into frame and takes the car keys out
     of Kathryn's hands.



     Annette races down the highway. She opens up the glove
     compartment and rifles through some cassettes. She takes
     out The Carpenter's Greatest Hits and inserts it.

     CUE UP: The Carpenter's singing "Goodbye To Love."

     Annette reaches down and takes out Sebastian's
     sunglasses. She puts them on and checks herself out in
     the rear-view mirror. A grin crosses her face.



     We MOVE off the Porsche and ascend into the air. The
     Porsche weaves through traffic as it disappears into a
     sea of cars. WE SEE the Manhattan skyline in the background
     as WE -
