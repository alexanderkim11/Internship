    DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96







    Northern Florida in the midst of a heat wave. Air
    conditioners fighting a losing battle. The gallery is
    full. The JUDGE a stern, old hand. The PROSECUTOR, an
    efficient man with a good case.

    The witness is BARBARA. She is maybe 13. She is a
    witness in a criminal trial. Her testimony has been
    carefully rehearsed.


               ... we go back to our homeroom for
               dismissal, unless you have a pass
               for sports or something.


               And is that what you did on the
               day in question?


               No. Mr. Gettys asked me to stay
               after class.


               What happened next, Barbara?


               Mr. Gettys closed the door.


               Everyone else had gone?


               Yes. He told me to sit in the
               chair beside his desk.

    MR. GETTYS, the defendant, is 50. The very picture of
    respectability. His perfect wife and son staunchly
    enduring this testimony.








                 In your own words, Barbara, can
                 you tell us exactly what happened
                 during the next few minutes?

    KEVIN LOMAX.    Defense counsel.   Taking it all in.


                 I told him I was afraid I would
                 miss my bus. He promised I would
                 get to the bus on time if I would
                 help him to do something...

    Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom --
    taking inventory -- assessing damage --


                 ... Then he put -- before I could
                 say anything -- he placed his hand
                 inside my blouse...

    Kevin -- checking the jury and --


                 ... I was so frightened I didn't
                 move. I thought if I was just
                 quiet it would be okay...

    Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops
    him cold --


                 ... Then his other hand went up
                 under -- inside my skirt...

    Gettys' hand -- down below the table -- down where no one
    but Kevin could possibly see it -- Getty's fingers subtly
    feeling their way along the leg of his chair --


                 ... his hand then, it started, he
                 started, moving back and forth --
                 farther and farther inside my
                 skirt...

    Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --


                 ... he said he was testing to see
                 if I had any special feelings,
                 that he wanted to find out what
                 kind of feelings I had...







    Gettys' hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg --
    absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual --


                 ... I didn't know what to say, I
                 was trying to think of something
                 to say but I was confused and he
                 just kept on -- with his hand --
                 moving it -- under my dress --
                 higher and higher...

    Kevin is rocked.    Trying not to show it.


                 ... then I, I was asking him to
                 stop but it was like he couldn't
                 hear me -- he just kept on --

    Suddenly, Gettys' hand stops moving --


                 -- and then I screamed...

    Kevin looks up to find Gettys' eyes waiting for him.
    Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap. He's been
    caught -- watching, as Kevin turns away and --


                 ... then he, he got mad and said
                 we would have to try again
                 sometime.


                 And did he try again?


                 Not with me.


                 With friends of yours?


                 Yes.


                 And when you told them what he had
                 done to you, they told you what he
                 had done to them, isn't that true?


                 Yes.


                 I have nothing further.








                        
                 Your witness, Mr. Lomax.


                 Any chance, Your Honor, for a
                 short recess?






    Kevin heading quickly away from the courtroom.     Gettys
    right on his heels.


                 Lloyd, as your attorney, I'm
                 advising you to get the fuck away
                 from me.


                 Why?   What are you talking about?


                 The wife. The kid. The outrage.
                 You definitely had me fooled.


                 You're my lawyer! You're here to
                 defend me!


                 You know what I'm thinking? Why
                 don't we put you on the stand and
                 you can jerk off for the judge.


                 You know she's lying.


                 Get the hell out of my way.

    Gettys standing aside, as we --






    An ancient upstairs facility. Kevin standing at the
    mirror. Frozen there. Identity crisis. Morality
    crisis. He takes off his wedding ring. Letting cold
    water run in the sink. His eyes never leaving the
    mirror.






    Behind him, the door opens.     A local REPORTER enters,
    moves to the urinal.


                 Well, hell, there you are. Rumor
                 was you were out wandering in
                 traffic.


                 Not now, Larry.


                 What's the game plan, Kevin? I
                 got a four-thirty deadline. I
                 need a quote. Gimme a quote.


                 Fuck off.


                 'Mr. Lomax had no comment on
                 today's events. Speculation,
                 however, was widespread that the
                 young lawyer's unblemished string
                 of victories would come to an end
                 in this courtroom.'

    Kevin pulls some cold water to his face. Startled, as
    THUNDER EXPLODES overhead -- then just as suddenly,
    becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing...


                 It was a nice run, Kev. Had to
                 close out someday. Nobody wins
                 'em all.

    The Reporter exits.      Kevin alone with the mirror.

    And then it's over.

    He's made his decision. Replacing his wedding ring.
    Reaching for his jacket, as we --






    Kevin walking through. His game face.      A court officer
    opening the doors and --



    DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96                        6.



    Barbara on the stand.   Everyone in place.


              Math hasn't exactly been your
              subject this year, has it?


              No.


              Any theories on why you've done so
              poorly in math this year?


              It's not my fault.


              Would you say Mr. Gettys is the
              problem?
                     
              You're not sure. Have you had
              any discipline problems in math
              class this year?


              No.


              No? Isn't it true Mr. Gettys has
              had to talk to you repeatedly
              about your behavior? Isn't that
              why he asked you to stay after
              class?


              No.


              Have other teachers ever asked you
              to stay after class?


              Once or twice.


              Did they want to talk about your
              behavior?


              Objection.    Immaterial.


              Goes to motive.



    DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96                          7.




                 Overruled.    You may answer the
                 question.


                 I don't know what the other
                 teachers wanted. You'd have to
                 talk to them.


                 You ever pass notes in class,
                 Barbara? Maybe a note that made
                 fun of Mr. Gettys?


                 No.


                 No? Never called him a
                 'disgusting pig monster'?


                 No.

    Kevin handing out paperwork.


                 Your Honor, I've pre-marked this
                 Defense Exhibit A...


                 Objection, Your Honor, we've had
                 plenty of time for discovery here.

    The Judge quickly studying his copy of the note.


                 I'm gonna let this in, Mr. Lomax,
                 I'm also gonna suggest that if
                 you have any other exhibits you
                 present in a timely fashion or not
                 at all.


                        (right to
                         the note)
                 I'm sorry, Barbara, I was wrong,
                 it's 'huge hog beast'. This is
                 your handwriting, isn't it?


                 Yes, but --



    DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96                          8.




                 You wrote this in his class.


                 It's a joke.


                 'He's a huge hog beast. He
                 probably eats a thousand pancakes
                 for breakfast.' You're writing
                 here about Mr. Gettys, aren't you?


                 It was meant to be a joke.


                 Have you ever had a party at your
                 house when your parents were away?
                        
                 Yes or no?


                 Objection.   This is way out of...


                 Credibility and bias.


                 Overruled.   Answer the question.


                        
                 Yes.


                 The word special came up in your
                 testimony earlier. You claimed
                 that Mr. Gettys asked you whether
                 you had special feelings, if you
                 felt special.
                        
                 Have you ever heard of a game
                 called 'Special Places?'
                        
                 You're under oath, Barbara. A
                 man's career -- his reputation --
                 his life is on the line. This is
                 not a joke. Have you ever played
                 the game Special Places?


                 Yes.



    DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96                          9.




                 Is this game sexual in nature?
                        
                 Is this game sexual in nature?


                 We only played it once.


                 This special party, Barbara, this
                 was the first time you told the
                 story about Mr. Gettys.


                 Yes.


                 I've spoken to the other children
                 who were there that day. Can you
                 think of anything else, Barbara,
                 they might have told me about that
                 party?


                 Objection. Your Honor, if he has
                 other witnesses let him call them.


                        
                 If I need to call those other
                 children, I will.


                 I'm gonna sustain that, Mr. Lomax.
                 Rephrase your question.


                 You threatened those children,
                 didn't you?


                 That's not the way it happened --


                 You told them to falsely claim
                 that Mr. Gettys had hurt them,
                 didn't you?


                 These things did happen!



    DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96                            9A.




                 Because if they didn't go along
                 you were going to tell everyone
                 about this special party.


                 They happened to me.


                 So you made up a story. A
                 special story, about a math
                 teacher -- a disgusting pig
                 monster -- you didn't like.
                 That's what really happened,
                 isn't it?


                 I didn't want to be the only one!

    BARBARA'S FATHER can take it no longer -- suddenly on his
    feet -- charging --


                 You son of a bitch!

    The bailiff making a diving grab --


                 I have no further questions, Your
                 Honor.

    Chaos -- court officers struggling with Barbara's Father
    and people yelling and Gettys hugging his wife and son
    and the gavel banging like mad and Kevin just sitting
    there, staring at the floor, completely drained,
    emotionally, morally, physically and --

    In the back of the room, a man. He's black. Elegant.
    Amused by the scene. His name is LEAMON HEATH.

    MARY ANN LOMAX leans in behind her husband.      She is a
    doll. We love her.








                 Pack it up, baby. You need a
                 drink.






    It's a rock and roll joint. Florida style. But it's
    early and empty. Kevin at the bar with Mary Ann, two
    LAWYER friends, the Reporter and someone's girl friend.
    12 shot glasses, two rows of six. A perfect tequila pour
    and --


                 In the event we all get drunk and
                 forget, I suggest we frontload the
                 ceremonial bullshit...
                        
                 To the best damn trial lawyer in
                 Alachua County.

    Kevin, subdued, watches the rest of them drink.


                 So, Kev, off the record, how's it
                 feel to squeeze a man like Gettys
                 through the door of reasonable
                 doubt?


                 No.
                        
                 I told you already, we're not
                 gonna discuss that damn case
                 anymore. Done.
                        
                 Am I right?


                 I'll drink to that.
                        
                 No shop talk.






    Tequila pours.      As the night goes on.







    Drunk frat boys laughing as they exit. A BAR BAND in the
    distance. Kevin done pissing. Moving for the sink, when
    he suddenly stops. Freezes. A mirror above the sink.
    There he is. The guy that set Gettys free.


              Mr. Lomax?

    Kevin turns -- Leamon Heath standing beside him.


              Helluva job today.
                     (quickly presenting
                      his card)
              I didn't want to disturb your
              party.


              Milton, Chadwick, Waters. Never
              heard of it.
                     
              What're you gonna do? Sue me?


              Actually, we were hoping to retain
              your services. We've been
              following your progress.


              From New York.


              You've never lost a case.


              I've had some sympathetic juries.


              That's exactly what we're looking
              for. We want you to come to New
              York. Help us pick a jury.


              Really.
                     
              I'll tell you, man. You're pretty
              damn good. And the card is great.
              And the black thing -- you being
              black -- whose idea was that?
              Paul's? 'Cause that's just
              brilliant.
                     
              I'm just not drunk enough yet to
              fall for it.








                  You'd have to start next week.
                         (waiting as Kevin
                          stops there)
                  All expenses. First class travel
                  and lodging. You and your wife.
                  A lump sum payment, regardless of
                  verdict in the amount of, well...
                         
                  Here. Take a look.

     Kevin takes the check.    Still looking at it, as we --






     Two dozen cars parked.    MUSIC and SINGING from inside.    A
     sign reads:






     Inside the church. Plain and functional. Poor but
     faithful. A trio -- electric guitar, accordion,
     tambourine -- playing a hymn. Forty-five voices raised
     in song. The tempo is ragged and the pitch shaky, but
     the feeling is strong. They mean it.

     The CAMERA FINDS -- MRS. LOMAX. Kevin's mother. Forty- six.
     Singing her heart out. A woman with faith, in the
     presence of her Lord.

     The CAMERA FINDS -- Kevin. In the very back. Standing
     in the doorway. Halfway in. Halfway out. Shadow.
     Light. Waiting.






     Post-service.    Mrs. Lomax and Kevin walking to her car.


                  It's two weeks at most.


                  You've never been to New York.








                  Every dog gets a day.


                  Pick a jury...
                         
                  I feel the hand of Mary Ann on
                  this adventure.


                  Mom.


                  New York is not a good idea.


                  Look, how you fixed for cash?


                  I have my bad feeling.


                         
                  I put a couple hundred in here...


                  Sounds like more than two weeks.


                  Mary Ann typed out the numbers for
                  you -- phone, the flights -- it's
                  all in there.


                  Let me tell you about New York.


                         
                  Babylon.


                  Forewarned is forearmed.
                         
                  'Fallen, fallen is Babylon the
                  great. It has become a dwelling
                  place of demons.' Revelation
                  Eighteen. Wouldn't hurt you to
                  look it over.


                         
                  Couldn't forget it if I tried.








                  And what happened to Babylon?


                  'Thou mighty city. In one hour
                  hast thou mighty judgement come.'


                  'And the light of a single lamp
                  shall shine in thee no more.'

     Kevin gathers her in.         Kissing her good-bye, as we --






     Darkness. Where are we? A door opens in another room --
     VOICES -- KEVIN and MARY ANN. They're LAUGHING. Coming
     in from a big night out. For an instant -- light -- we
     glimpse a great hotel suite -- and then --


                  -- wait -- leave 'em off --


                  -- what are you... I can't --


                  -- close your eyes -- do it --

     More LAUGHTER.       Stumbling shadows moving PAST us and --


                  Okay.    Stop.




     Kevin behind Mary Ann with his hands over her eyes.        He
     takes his hands away, but her eyes stay closed...


                  Okay.    Open your eyes.


                           
                  Wow.




     The view.    Wham.    The definitive New York skyline.






               'Go ahead...'
                      
               '... bite the Big Apple.'


                      
               '... Rats on the West Side, bed
               bugs uptown, I can't give it away
               on Seventh Avenue. This town
               don't look good in tatters...'


               I don't know... looks to me like
               that dress is in your way.


                      
               Why, counselor...
                      
               Surely you don't think a small-
               town girl changes overnight just
               because a man buys her dinner in
               the big city.


               No, ma'am. In fact, I hardly ever
               think at all.


               Well, that's different, then.
               You're my kind of guy.

     Kevin smiles.   She's taking off the dress.   Babylon.






     Six huge courthouses.   All those courtrooms.






     Criminal court. Voire dire. Potential jurors fill the
     benches. A bored judge. MEISEL, defense counsel, is a
     sour, New York veteran. The juror being questioned, a
     PIE-FACED MAN with bad vision.



     DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/15/96                          16.




                  Do you think as a juror you'd be
                  able to set aside any prior
                  opinions you might hold about the
                  savings and loan industry?
                         
                  That was a question, sir.


                  What?   Do I like bankers?

     Heath catches Meisel's eye.     Waves him over.


                  Your Honor, may I have a minute to
                  speak with my colleagues.




     Kevin and Heath. And the defendant -- a well-tailored
     reptilian banker. Meisel joins them. Sotto voce.


                  Dump him. While you're at it
                  let's get rid of number six,
                  eight, and I'd say lose number
                  twelve, except the prosecutor's
                  gonna fuck up and do it for us.


                  Number six? You're kidding,
                  right? She's my first choice.


                  She's my first pass.


                  And eight? With the dreadlocks?
                  That's crazy. He's a defendant
                  juror if I ever saw one.


                  You see his shoes?


                  Look, kid, maybe down in Florida
                  you're the next big thing, but
                  this is New York. Manhattan.
                  We're not squeezing oranges here.








                  He polishes those shoes every
                  night. He makes his own clothes.
                  He may look like a brother-with-
                  an-attitude to you, but I see a
                  man who's got a shotgun under his
                  bed and woe betide the creature
                  who steps into his garden.
                         
                  And number six? Your favorite?
                  She's damaged goods.


                  She's a Catholic schoolteacher.
                         
                  She believes in human frailty.


                  No. There's something missing
                  from her. She's wrong.
                         
                  She wants on this jury. Somebody
                  hurt her and she wants revenge.


                  How the hell do you know that?


                         
                  I don't know.


                         
                  Look, either you put a stop to
                  this happy horseshit or I walk.


                  Walk.


                         
                  All right. Here's the deal.
                         
                  I lose with your jury? You do the
                  explaining.

     The defendant staring a hole into Kevin, as we --






     Kevin leaving court.    In no hurry to get home.    He likes
     it here.






      Across the street, a man, one of many passing on the
      sidewalk. Except this man turns as Kevin passes.
      Watching him. Seeing something that pleases him.

      This is JOHN MILTON. And now, as Kevin disappears,
      Milton joins the flow of people heading down into a
      subway station -- down -- and gone, as we PULL BACK TO --




      As day becomes night.















      Mary Ann watching TV alone. Remnants of a room service
      dinner. They've been living here for weeks now. The
      maids have started to give up.

      Kevin enters looking beat.    Grabs a cold french fry.


                          
                   Your mother called. She has her
                   bad feeling.


                   Every now and then she gets one
                   right.


                   What's up?
                          
                   You okay? Something's up.


                   They deliberated for thirty-eight
                   minutes.


                   Oh shit...




     DEVIL'S ADVOCATE - Rev. 11/2/96                               19.




                         (turns off the TV,
                          comforting him)
                  Oh, Kevin... I'm sorry, honey. What
                  the hell did they expect? The man
                  is guilty as can be. Wasn't a jury
                  anywhere gonna let him off.


                  Yeah.   Except one.


                  Kev....


                         
                  Not fucking guilty.


                  Omigod...


                  Thirty-eight minutes.     My jury.


                  You did it!   Omigod, Kevin...


                  Put on something that's gonna be
                  easy to take off later. We are
                  going out, girl!





     Milton, Chadwick, Waters. Those words written in stone
     on the wall. The decor is stark, dramatic, awesome. The
     receptionist is simply stunning. Kevin, wearing his best
     suit, walking with Heath.


                  Sorry to keep you waiting, but Mr.
                  Milton got pinned down in Indonesia
                  a little longer than expected.
                         (quietly as they
                          hit the view)
                  Not bad, huh? You can play it cool
                  if you want, but the first time I
                  walked in here, my jaw was on the floor.



     The firm offices.      A large central atrium.    Offices rim
     this space.






     Lawyers come in all shapes and sizes. Assistants -- male
     and female -- are uniformly attractive. The HUM of
     serious BUSINESS in the background.


                         
                  We've got forty partners vested at
                  the moment. Close to six hundred
                  associates. This is the home
                  office, but we've got quite a few
                  international arrangements, so Mr.
                  Milton spends a good deal of his
                  time in the air. In addition to
                  our corporate clients, we're
                  currently representing about
                  twenty-five foreign countries.
                  Mid-East, Balkans, Central
                  America, West Africa. Interesting
                  work, but travel intensive.

     Kevin slowing as they pass an open doorway --


                  He's got you scheduled for fifteen
                  minutes, which is a good sign, so
                  make the most of it...




     THROUGH a large window we see a woman pacing her office.
     She's wearing a headset and arguing in machine-gun
     Italian. She is a goddess. Her name is CHRISTABELLA.
     She is beautiful beyond propriety. She will also turn
     out to be a brilliant EUC lawyer. She turns. Sees us
     staring -- like that -- Venetian blinds close tightly.




     Heath is now far ahead.    Kevin rushing to catch up --




     Kevin about six steps into it when suddenly, he looks
     down. Stops. Completely spooked.


                  Gotcha.
                         
                  Man, I just love that...







     The floor is nothing but glass. Sixty stories above the
     world. A bridge between two skyscrapers.


                  I watched a Senator piss his pants
                  right where you're standing.


                           
                  Great.


                  He's waiting for you.      Good luck.

     Kevin sucks it up.      Starts walking.    Up ahead, nothing
     but an open door.






     First of all it's round. And large. The walls are made
     of stone. No windows. There are dramatic shafts of
     natural light from above. Stark and clean to the
     extreme. No paper anywhere.

     Kevin standing there.      Taking in the space.


                  Behind you.

                  Nice to meet you.


                  Have we been treating you well?


                  Very well.    Thank you.








                  Your wife, she's had a good time?


                  She sure has. It's been great.
                  The whole thing's been great.


                  Good. That's our secret. We kill
                  you with kindness.

                          circling)
                  What's your secret?


                  I couldn't say.


                  You were a prosecutor.


                  Out of law school. Five years in
                  the Jacksonville D.A.'s office.


                  Sixty-four straight convictions.
                  What a number.


                  I like to be in court.   I didn't
                  plea out a lot.


                  What's that like? One day you're
                  putting them away and the next
                  you're setting them free?


                  Takes a little getting used to.


                  Pays better though, doesn't it?


                  Yes it does.


                  The math teacher. The Gettys
                  case. I hear you were brilliant.

                  Really.   So you think your guy was
                  guilty.


                  I didn't say that.


                  What did you say?


                  How's this? I began the case with
                  a clear conscience.


                         
                  I was sure you had a secret.


                  The men's room.
                         
                  Upstairs men's room in the Duval
                  County courthouse. There's a hole
                  in the wall. Straight through to
                  the next room.
                         
                  I spent five years listening to
                  juries deliberate.


                  I love it.


                  Love it all you want, just don't
                  repeat it. I'm not sure the
                  Florida Bar Association would
                  appreciate it.

                  to Florida, do you? Walk with me.




     With that, Milton pushes a button.     Huge panel screens

     A reflecting pool. Water right to the edge. A narrow
     walkway straight through the middle. And we're fifty
     stories above the city. The effect is staggering.

                  your family. What does your
                  father do?


                  I never got to know my father. He
                  passed away before I was born. My
                  mom raised me. Just the two of
                  us.


                  She never remarried?


                  She wasn't married the first time.


                  That can't be easy in Gainesville.


                  I don't think it's easy anywhere.

                  Little different when you're

                  Tell me about her. Your mother.
                  What's she like?


                  She's a preacher's daughter.
                  She's tough. She's worked in the
                  same poultry plant for as long as
                  I can remember. I think she's up
                  to eight-fifty an hour. She's got
                  a church she really likes, so
                  she's usually either there or they
                  go out, they do a lot of volunteer
                  work.

                  just like everyone else and I'm
                  tired of sending their business
                  across the street.


                  Are you offering me a job?


                  I'm thinking about it. You have
                  the talent. I knew that before
                  you got here. It's the other
                  thing I wonder about.

                  them, it's really a partner's

                  empty. I feel as though I've
                  let you all down.

                   Pam was with the Brooklyn D.A.'s
                   office for fourteen years, so she
                   knows her way around the local
                   scene. She'll be your guide.
                          
                   You're gonna be expediting his New
                   York Bar application, right?


                   In the pipeline. For now, we'll
                   just have you work pro hac vice.
                   We've petitioned Florida for a
                   letter of good conduct. And...
                          
                   ... I prepared, at Mr. Milton's
                   request, an overview of the Moyez
                   case.


                   The Moyez case?






      Deep ghetto side street. One of those blocks that have
      been completely lost. One whole side of the street has
      nothing but boarded-up row houses.

      A black Town Car pulling through.    Slowing now --




      Kevin and his DRIVER peering across the street.


                   I gotta stick with the vehicle.






      A storefront botanica. Insane colors. Rusted iron
      grates covering two tiny cataract windows. A steel door
      is open. There's a sick-looking DOG tied to the doorknob;
      he begins BARKING wildly, as he sees --

      Kevin walking from the car.    Suit and tie.     Briefcase.
      Turning, as he hears --

     Three JUNKIES camped on the stoop of a burned-out
     brownstone across the street. Dull, wasted faces aroused
     by the DOG'S BARKING --


                  Tell her turn that shit down! I
                  know what she's doin'! That's
                  right! Tell 'em take that noise
                  back t'Africa 'fore I --

     Stopping instantly because -- a WOMAN is standing in the
     botanica doorway. Her skin is jet black. Her eyes are
     pale blue. Her hair is white. She holds a live chicken
     by its feet. The DOG is still BARKING so she slaps it.
     Hard. Now there is silence.


                  I'm looking for Phillipe Moyez.

     She moves aside.    Kevin enters --




     It's dark. Oil lamps and candles for light. The air
     thick with incense. Jars and bags and boxes are stacked
     on shelves everywhere. Powders. Oils. Bones. Skins.
     Potions. Dried herbs.


                  I called this morning, I'm not
                  sure who I spoke with.
                         
                  I'm his lawyer. I have a card...
                         
                  They said he would meet me here.
                  Phillipe Moyez.


                         
                  Bhalla! Bhalla!

     Kevin taking a very deep breath, as we --






     Darkness. A door opening above us. A BOY -- maybe ten
     -- standing there. Kevin behind him.








                  Look, I'm not sure I'm making
                  myself clear here.


                  Moyez.
                         
                  You need him. Speak wid him.




     The Boy hits the lights. A naked bulb on the landing
     below. Beyond that, darkness.


                  You're saying he's down here?
                         
                  In the basement? In the dark?


                         
                  Where? Where you think -- ?
                  Where you think me taking you?




     The Boy, still laughing, starts down the stairs -- into
     the darkness. Kevin hesitates. Sucks it up. Crouching
     not to hit his head as he goes down into --




     Around the landing -- the Boy still in front of him and
     -- down -- as another light comes up and the boy moves
     quickly through the space, turning on lamps here and
     there. No furniture. Mounds of bones. The walls
     painted a deep, black red.




     Kevin waiting as the last light goes on --


                  I thought I would recognize you,
                  but I do not.

     Kevin, spooked, wheels around --







     PHILLIPE MOYEZ squatting in the corner. Skinny and
     intense. His eyes opaque and piercing at the same time.
     At once unassuming and terrifying. A plastic bag of
     fresh green roots in his lap. Ghat. Miraa. African
     cocaine. His teeth black from chewing it.


                  Mr. Moyez?
                         
                  We've never met. I'm a lawyer.
                  I'm here about the animals.


                  As you wish.


                  I'll be arguing your case with the
                  city. I need to ask you some
                  questions.
                         
                  I've done a little preliminary
                  research -- precedent -- cases in
                  the past that dealt with Santeria
                  and Vou--


                  No. This is not Santeria. We are
                  not Voodoo. Candomble.
                  Obeayisne. None of that. We are
                  much older. Before. Before all
                  of it.


                  Okay.   Is there a name?   Or...


                  We have papers. At your firm.      We
                  have the tax exemption.


                  Okay.  I'll get right into that.
                         
                  The animals. Let's start with
                  that, then.


                  We have an investment in blood.
                  Think of it as spiritual currency.

     Moyez stands.    Starts slowly across the room.


                  Look, Mr. Moyez, I'm going to need
                  your help with this.








                  Yes.   That's very clear.


                  Perhaps we could start at the
                  beginning?

     Moyez, ignoring him, moves to an old refrigerator beside
     the stairs. For an instant, the door is open -- just a
     glimpse. Meat. Bags of entrails. Jars of blood. Moyez
     goes to a workbench near the wall --


                  Mr. Moyez?


                  What is the name of the man who
                  will prosecute us?


                         
                  Merto. Assistant District
                  Attorney Arnold Merto.


                  Bhalla.   La chemise noire.   Vite!

     The Boy already running up the stairs.       The sound of
     NAILS FALLING onto the workbench --


                  What are you doing, Mr. Moyez?

     Moyez stands aside, wiping his hands on his trousers.        A
     huge beef tongue sits on the bench. The nails are
     scattered around it.


                  You can go now. You will have all
                  the help I can give you.

     Moyez now with a hammer. And the nail. Driving it into
     the tongue. Kevin backing away, as we --

     Hand-held footage of a police raid. We're running --
     through a building -- New York cops -- an animal control
     officer -- through a door -- voices yelling -- down some
     steps -- into a back yard -- people standing --

     shaking -- we see Bhalla -- and the Woman -- and --

     There -- in the middle, is a goat -- on its knees -- its
     throat has just been cut -- blood pouring into a pan and
     Moyez holding its head with one hand -- a knife in the
     other and this positively orgiastic expression on his
     face, and on that image, we freeze frame.

               It's a health code case. And it's
               a loser. So what's the point?
                      
               It's a test, right?


               Isn't everything?


               The smart thing to do is make a
               deal. Plea him out and suppress

                U.S.D.A. approved and stamped.
                Eight days ago, in Kansas City,
                two men pushed a calf into a steel
                frame as a third man fired a high-
                voltage staple-gun into the
                animal's skull. Men kill animals
                and eat their flesh. Phillipe Moyez
                killed a goat. He killed a goat.
                And he did it at home, in a manner
                consistent with his religious
                beliefs. Now some people may find
                it bizarre.

                  It's certainly not a religious
                  practice performed by everyone.
                  It's not as common as, say,
                  circumcision. It's certainly not
                  as common as the belief that wine
                  is transformed into blood. It's
                  not even as common as the handling
                  of poisonous snakes to prove one's
                  faith. But Phillipe Moyez isn't
                  two thousand miles away in a
                  stockyard. He doesn't use
                  electricity to kill. And worst of
                  all...
                         (holding up
                           the roast)
                  Phillipe Moyez is not shrink-

     Merto begins to cough.    Quietly at first, but...


                  Your Honor, the city timed this
                  police action to catch my client
                  exercising his constitutionally-
                  protected right to religious
                  freedom.

     Merto's coughing getting worse as he tries to stop...


                  This is a law protecting Kosher
                  butchering.


                  Exactly, Your Honor. And I'd like
                  to move at this time for an
                  immediate directed verdict for
                  dismissal.

     Moyez staring a hole in Merto, and the man cannot stop
     coughing...


                  I happen to know a little bit

                  requesting a dismissal.

                  You gotta be kidding.


                  What do you think? We're giving
                  you away? He's paying us in
                  goat's blood? I'm billing you
                  out at four-hundred an hour, my
                  friend. I don't see a whole lot
                  of pro bono work in your
                  immediate future.
                         
                  Seriously, what I like, you got in
                  there with him. Inside the cage.
                  That's instinct. Can't be taught.
                  You gotta hear that on your own.
                  It's gotta be in your blood. It's
                  molecular. I bet I've got five
                  thousand lawyers working around
                  the planet. I couldn't name
                  ten -- couldn't name three --
                  I'd trust with Moyez.


                  So what the hell are they doing?


                  What are they doing? They're
                  corporate lawyers, what do
                  you think they're doing? They're
                  busy reducing life and death to
                  the proper position of a semi-
                  colon. They're doing needlepoint.
                  Push button battles. Push button
                  wars. Armies that get so fucking
                  far away from each other they
                  need satellites to tell them

                  hand, you're on the slaughterhouse

                  your clients.

                  make sure I didn't fuck this up.

                  Maybe I did. But don't get too
                  cocky. No matter how good you
                  are. Don't let them see you
                  coming. That's the gaff, my
                  friend -- make yourself small.
                  Be the hick. The cripple. The
                  nerd. The leper. The shit-
                  kicking surfer. Look at me --
                  I've been underestimated from
                  day one. Do I look like a
                  master of the universe? That's
                  your only weakness as far as I
                  can tell.


                  What's that?


                  The look. The Florida stud thing.
                  'Scuse me, ma'am, did I leave my
                  boots under your bed?'

                  You know what you're missing?
                  What I have? This beautiful girl
                  she's just fucked me every way
                  she knows how -- we're done --
                  she's walking to the bathroom --
                  she turns back -- and there I am.
                  It's me. And she smiles -- it's
                  like a veil coming down across
                  her face -- and that smile, that's
                  a question mark, because she's
                  looking at me, she's wondering,
                  how did that happen? And see,
                  right there, from that moment on,
                  she's got a secret. I'm the hand
                  up Mona Lisa's skirt. I'm the
                  whisper in Nefertitti's ear.
                  I'm a surprise. They never see
                  me coming. That's what you're
                  missing.

                  Because I knew it was gonna be
                  good. Because I knew I was gonna
                  like it. That you would shine --
                  that we would take this walk --
                  that we'd really talk. Why I
                  came down? You want the truth?
                  I'm an aging, hipster plutocrat.
                  I came up from nothing. From
                  dirt. I'm warming my hands on

                  Where's the chicken? The chicken
                  that plays tic-tac-toe. He used
                  to be right here.


                         
                  No, you passed it. Back that way.

                  Look, I'm rambling because I'm
                  excited. You're in the part of
                  the game I like best. The realm
                  of the True Believers. You are
                  a believer, aren't you?


                  I believe in the presumption of

                  Something like that.


                  No. Exactly like that. It's
                  faith. You're either in or out.
                  You can't believe a little bit.

     Milton offering a token.       Behind him, the entrance to the
     Canal Street station --


                  Learn the subways, Kevin. Use
                  them. Stay in the trenches.

     Kevin taking the token, as we --











     Kevin just coming in from work. The apartment is
     starting to come together. Still not enough furniture,
     but the sparseness reads as elegance.

     He stops. In the hallway -- a wall is missing --
     sheetrock stacked on the floor -- tools piled around -- a
     renovation project halted for the night.


                  What's all this?


                  All what?

     Mary Ann up the hall in the bedroom door.      Finishing her
     makeup for a night out.


                  Oh, that...
                         
                  It was gonna be a nursery, but
                  then I remembered you'd have to be
                  home long enough to knock me up,
                  so now I'm thinking of building a
                  law library.

     Kevin smiles.    Drops his briefcase.     Drops his pants.


                  Save the thought. We were due up
                  there fifteen minutes ago.

     She blows him a kiss.    Ducking back into bedroom.






     Kevin and Mary Ann in their go-to-meeting clothes.      Going
     up. Nervous.


                  Tell me I can handle this.


                  You can handle this.

     The door opens.    DIANA BARZOON, tonight's hostess,

     Twice the size of Kevin's place. Decorated and furnished
     to the max. Seventy-five guests and ten in staff. The
     crowd is very smart, sleek, and experienced at these sort
     of things. Mary Ann's hand squeezing Kevin's just a bit
     more tightly as Diana leads them into the throng, and we
     begin --






     Faces -- some of them strangers.    Some of them familiar
     from the conference room scene.




     huddled with Jackie and Mary Ann as Heath brings them
     drinks from the bar.




     and two lawyers near the terrace doors -- the smoking
     section -- talking with nicotine-driven intensity.

     They've found Kevin and Mary Ann.


               I love the eights. The entire 'A'

                       a bit insane)
               I do. I envy you. Starting from
               scratch. Do you have your fabrics
               yet? Tell me you don't.


               Not yet.   I don't think so.


               Come with me. Instantly.
                      
               I'm borrowing your wife...


               Be gentle, honey. These are
               normal people.

     Mary Ann giving Kevin a "help me" look as she's dragged
     into the party --


               Your first?


               Excuse me?


               Is this your first marriage?










     Front door -- abuzz -- Milton has just arrived.

     Across the room, Mary Ann with Jackie and Diana and
     another wife --


               Who is that?


                      
               My God, girl...


               You haven't met him yet?


               Who is he?




     Milton -- across the room -- looks over -- he's found
     them -- already coming toward them -- smiling --


               I swear he can hear us.


               Hell, he can smell us.


               Mary Ann? John Milton...
                      
               I was hoping we'd meet tonight.
               And here you are, already swimming
               with the sharks.

     Even as he says this, he's kissing their smiling cheeks.
     Mary Ann looking a little lost, as we --






     Kevin talking with another lawyer. Looking over as
     Christabella glides through the room.

                  Deadbeats. I mean, that's what it
                  comes down to. You can call
                  yourself a finance trainee, or
                  a financial resources adviser,
                  or whatever, you're still
                  spending most of your day trying
                  to hammer car payments out of
                  deadbeats.
                         
                  No deadbeats here tonight.


                  You'd be surprised. There's a
                  lot more fear in this room than
                  you'd think.


                  What do these people have to be
                  afraid of?


                  Each other. Themselves.   Why?
                  What scares you?


                  Not knowing who the deadbeats are.


                  You'll figure that out. There's
                  only one thing worth being
                  frightened of anyway, and that's
                  being alone. Truly and finally
                  alone.


                  Yes.   I think you're right.


                  You know what terrifies me?
                  Responsibility.


                  For what?


                  For what. For you. Let's be
                  honest, I've changed your life.
                  Changed it forever. There's
                  been a seismic shift in your
                  existence and I'm responsible.
                  And you've never even met me.
                  We're talking for the very
                  first time. How insane is that?

                  Kevin.


                  Kevin. Please. I'm not worried
                  about Kevin. He buys a few new
                  suits. Learns a few new tricks.
                  He's there. I don't worry about
                  Kevin. What about you?


                  I'm not leaving a lot behind.


                  You must have family.


                  Bad subject. I haven't spoken
                  to my folks in a long time. My
                  sister ran all the way to
                  Germany.


                  Whoaa... I gotta think about that.
                  I had you down as daddy's little
                  girl, you know? The princess.
                  Sugar plum snapshots. Pastel
                  bedspreads. Cinnamon cookies.


                  I tell Kevin the only thing worse
                  than not having a father was
                  having mine.


                  So you've got a lot at stake here.
                  You've made a real commitment.


                  I guess I have.


                  It's not gonna be like
                  Gainesville, but then you know
                  that already.


                  We're gonna be fine. It's gonna
                  be great.

                  If it isn't, will you come to me?
                  Let me help? I'd feel a lot less
                  responsible. Will you do that
                  for me?


                  Sure.


                  The worst vice is advice, right?
                  But can I make a suggestion?
                  It's about your hair, some people
                  are sensitive, that's why I ask.


                  No. I mean, go ahead. You don't
                  like it?


                  You have shoulders nobody can see.
                  Pull it back.


                  You mean, you want me to pull my

                  If I do it, everyone in this room
                  that's pretending not to watch us
                  will assume we're fucking or
                  something. Pull back your hair.
                         
                  Take a look. See. That's it.
                  Isn't that incredible? You need
                  to cut your hair.


                  You're kidding.


                  A woman's shoulders are the
                  frontlines of her mystique.
                  And her neck, if she's alive,
                  has the very mystery of a
                  border town. It's the no
                  man's land in the battle
                  between mind and body.

     Kevin standing at the rail.    He looks over.   Christabella
     not ten feet away.


               Do you have this view?


               Sorry?


               From your terrace, is this your
               view?


               Sort of. Not exactly. I'm about
               twelve floors down. What about
               you?


               No, I live downtown. This is the
               family building.


               Sounds like fun. Downtown, I
               mean. I'm just getting to know
               the city.


               Is it everything you expected?


               More.

                    Excuse me?


                    Of the situation. You prefer to

                    Depends on the view.

     Getting louder and wilder. Mary Ann looking lost.
     Searching for Kevin... He's not here... not there...


                Have you seen Kevin?

     Jackie Heath shaking her head no, as Mary Ann continues
     on through the party.






     Silence.   Going up.   Kevin, Heath, and Barzoon.






     Mary Ann still looking for Kevin. Scanning faces.
     Stopping as she reaches a door. Opening it and --




     Just enough light to make out two MEN standing across the
     room. Silhouettes against the window.


                Sorry...
                       
                I'm looking for my husband.

     The Men -- two vaguely familiar faces from the firm.


                Don't think he's here.

     Suddenly, a WOMAN's head rises INTO FRAME --


                It's just us...


                But feel free to join in...

     And suddenly it's clear, she's walked in on an impromptu
     menage a trois. The Woman is kneeling on a table, dress
     hiked up, ass in the air. Man #1 fucking her from behind.
     Man #2 is getting blown and --

     The penthouse. One enormous room. Grand scale
     everything. Otherworldly. Staggering. Of special,
     special interest: a huge Bas Relief dominates an entire
     wall. Carved into the marble are human forms -- young,
     naked bodies swimming in a hypnotic chaos of clouds.

     Milton is on the phone. Two lines going. The dialogue
     is unimportant, we'll not understand it anyway -- he's
     going back and forth between Korean and Russian --
     brokering some emergency deal.

     Heath is at the bar, mixing drinks. Barzoon has a cigar.
     Kevin just standing there gaping at the space.


               Is there more to it?


               Just this room.


               And a bedroom?


               No bedroom.


               Where does he sleep?

                  When did this happen?


                  Just now. Tonight. I already

                  Look, I appreciate the vote of
                  confidence, but maybe Eddie's got
                  a point here.


                  We can get this case.   The man's
                  our client.

                  We know him better than he knows
                  himself. We have the inside
                  track. We have the best damn
                  trial lawyer in the city. It's
                  ours to lose.


                  Tell it to Cullen.


                  No.    That's up to Kevin.

                  what people know. They know you
                  and your wife were living
                  separately. They see this maid --
                  Elucinda -- a sixty-eight-year-old
                  grandmother supporting seven
                  children. And then there's your
                  stepson, a ten-year-old with a
                  bullet in his brain. Those are
                  already powerful images in the mind
                  of the public.

                  need immediate representation.


                  I've got a fourteen-year-old
                  stepdaughter who I care more about
                  than anything in the world. They
                  won't let me call her from
                  downtown. They won't let me talk
                  to her after I'm out. I gotta go
                  deal with that first.


                  We need to issue a statement.

     Cullen looks to Milton.    Waiting.   Help me.


                  He's a winner, Alex. And they'll
                  never see him coming.


                  I'm gonna make some very tough
                  phone calls. Then I'm gonna take a

               This is three thousand dollars.


               Know what you need to do? Buy it.
               Wear it once. And then throw it
               away. That'll loosen you up.


               I say spend it all. If you're
               never gonna see your husband, you
               might as well have a relationship
               with his money.
                      
               I swear, if he wasn't afraid of me
               shooting my mouth off, Eddie
               would've put a cellulite clause in
               the pre-nup.


               Dr. Robert,   I'm telling you, he's
               the miracle   man. You've seen my
               new tits, I   mean who does it
               better than   that?


               It's not my tits I'm worried
               about.

     Mary Ann turns.   Jackie beside her.   Topless.   Smiling.


               Real or not?
                      
               They look real...
                      
               They move real...


                      
               Must be real.


               Feel them. Go ahead.     That's the
               ultimate test.

     Before Mary Ann can stop her, Jackie is taking her hand,
     guiding it to her breast, and holding it there.

                    Feel real?


                    Yes.
                           
                    Absolutely. Real.


                           
                    Dr. Robert. When you're ready.

       Mary Ann looking away as Jackie walks off.    Everything is
       as it was, and yet different.

       And then, she turns and sees --







        Jackie pulling a dress down over her head.

       She's taking her time because it's a delicate, clingy...




       ... complicated outfit -- turning -- and for one brief
       moment we see a serpent's head -- disappearing now into
       the dress as she struggles inside the material -- her
       body -- the body inside the dress -- transforming -- ribs
       and spikes and huge moving muscles strain the limits of
       the material, and then, suddenly, it's over.




       Jackie's face appears.    She straightens the seams.
       Turning now --


                    What do you think?

       But Mary Ann is gone.

                ASAP -- I want articles, clippings,
                TV interviews, I want everything
                you can get on Alex Cullen.

                   Thank you.


                   What an incredible situation, even
                   if you lose you become a star.


                   What if I win?

                   If you win it's everything.


                   Any advice?


                   Cullen is a pig. He's a pig
                   beyond reasonable doubt. I
                   suggest you keep him as far away
                   from the jury as possible.


                   I'll keep it in mind.

                   don't fuck married men.

      He turns instantly -- Pamela standing behind him.


                   Your wife is on the phone.   She
                   sounds upset...

      Christabella smiling as Kevin rushes off.






      Mary Ann very upset.    Kevin has just come home.


                   I don't care if they can hear me!
                   I don't care! I don't like it here.
                   And these women, my God... I mean,
                   I'm seeing things for crissake!


                   You just left them in the store?


                   Yes!


                   Look, calm down, all right?
                   Listen to me... Mare? First,
                   you do this radical thing with
                   your hair...


                   You hate it.


                   Stop. I think it's fine. But I
                   also think it's traumatic.
                   You've got the pressure of
                   fitting in with new friends,
                   a new place... add three bottles
                   of wine and --


                   No! It wasn't the wine. It
                   wasn't the wine or my hair or
                   talking to Kathy, because I know
                   that's what you're gonna say --

                   What about Kathy?


                   What about her? She's pregnant
                   again.


                   Oh, and that's got nothing to do
                   with it...


                   Kevin, I never see you anymore.
                   Now that you've got this big case,
                   it's just only gonna get worse. I
                   don't know anybody here. These
                   women scare the living shit out of
                   me. If you can believe it, I'm
                   actually looking forward to having
                   your mother come and visit.


                   What about the apartment?


                   Exactly! You just go out -- you
                   buy a few new suits and you're
                   fine. I've got this whole place
                   to fill up and I know we have all
                   this money and it's supposed to
                   be fun, but it isn't! It's like
                   a test! The whole thing is
                   like one big test! I'm lonely.


                   Let's make a baby.


                   Don't tease me.


                   I wouldn't do that. Unless you
                   asked.


                   You hate my hair, don't you?

      of her neck. She moves into his body and --

      in his arms -- before he can react -- before he can speak
      -- she finds his mouth and they are kissing and --




      Suddenly -- She's Mary Ann -- and he's pulling up her
      dress and she's helping him and his hand is moving over
      bare thigh and --

       Suddenly -- She's Christabella unbuttoning her
      blouse -- and she can't do it fast enough -- still with
      her mouth on his and his hand between her legs and --




      Suddenly -- She's Mary Ann -- flattening against the wall
      and her blouse is open and --




       Suddenly -- She's Christabella -- pulling off her
      bra as his mouth moves over her breasts and his hands are
      everywhere and the bra is gone and she's tearing at his
      shirt and he's helping her and her dress is on the floor
      and there's no rug or anything, but this is where they
      will fuck because they can't stop themselves and she's on
      her back on the bare floor and he's kicking away his
      shoes and she's feeling herself and staring into his eyes
      and suddenly --





                Stop.

      Kevin looks like he's been shot.      In the balls.


                Where are you?


                Right here.

      Mary Ann doesn't look so sure.






      Huge. Opulent. Kevin and Pamela have been taking notes.
      Cullen is exhausted, frustrated.


                ... because it needs to be clear,
                Mr. Cullen, because I need to
                understand exactly what happened --
                you're standing there -- you look
                down -- there's the gun --

                   I don't know why I picked it up --
                   it was before I saw Elucinda's
                   body and then, I mean we've been
                   over this...


                   You kneeled down to pick it up?


                   You work late. You come home.
                   You walk in. Everybody's dead.
                   It's not something you plan for.


                   Back up. Two prints by the gun.
                   Right knee. Right hand. It's a
                   strange move you must've made to
                   pick it up.


                   The blood, I don't know, maybe I
                   was trying to avoid the blood.


                   I'm trying to picture it...
                          
                   Your hand came from inside and
                   underneath.

      Cullen reaches into his jacket and pulls out a gun.


                   You want to see? Here...

      Kevin watching Cullen quickly retrieve the gun from the
      floor with this weird little motion.


                           
                   Okay?   Clear? Got it?

                   You're charged in a triple
                   homicide, you're walking around
                   with a forty-five?


                   I've had nine death threats.


                   Give it over.    Now. Gimme the
                   gun.


                   I gotta protect myself.


                   That's my job. When the case is
                   over you can have it back.
                          
                   This is a dealbreaker, Alex.

      Cullen hands him the gun.


                   Okay.   Let's wrap it up.


                   So what's next?


                   We need to talk to your assistant.

                   on the time.


                   Melissa, yeah. She's okay.     She's
                   a real straight arrow.


                   So we're going to talk to her and
                   you're not going to talk to
                   anybody. Okay?

      A large, ugly cube. Daylight through dirty windows.
      Kevin alone. On the table, a large, grey envelope.
      Printed on it:




      Kevin going through a stack of crime scene photographs.

      Tough stuff. One after another. Three victims.    Many

      PANNING ALONG Wall Street. The whole downtown skyline.
      SETTLING finally ON the 60th floor of the law firm
      building. Hovering at a distance. Lights on here and
      there and --

      One window. Kevin's office. He and Pamela are talking
      to a young woman. This is MELISSA BLOCK, Cullen's
      assistant and alibi. We can't hear what they're saying,
      but it looks to be a collegial meeting.









      Kevin and Pam walking Melissa out through the empty
      reception area.


                Would my babysitter have to
                testify?


                We need her to establish the time
                you returned home.


                She doesn't have her green card is
                why I ask. I don't want her to
                get in trouble.

                   Tell you what, Melissa, let's talk
                   to her first. See where she
                   stands and take it from there.


                   I'll make sure Melissa gets down
                   to the car.


                   Mr. Cullen didn't kill those
                   people.


                   That's why we're all working so
                   hard.

      As Melissa exits with Pam, Kevin notices two associates
      carrying boxes far up the hall and we --






      Paper shredders. Half a dozen of them cranking full
      tilt. Stacks of files left to go. Barzoon and six

                   Okay, Excelsior Insurance, who's
                   handling that?
                          
                   All this has to go. Guatemala,

                   me, it'll take all night.

      Barzoon stops as he sees Kevin in the doorway.


                   I thought I was the only one
                   working late.


                   So did we.

                   Good news. We just wrapped up
                   with Cullen's assistant. She
                   looks like a great alibi.


                   What a pleasant surprise.


                   But it looks like you have your
                   hands full.


                   Just a little housekeeping.
                          
                   If they ask, you never saw this.


                   Who would ask?


                   Weaver.


                   Who's that?


                   Justice Department. Weaver
                   Commission.
                          
                   You don't know about Weaver?


                   Sorry.


                   How nice for you.

      Milton in the hall behind Kevin.        Tickets in hand.

                   Do it on the way.

                   You get my message?


                   You write beautifully, Eddie.


                   We need to talk.


                   Soon.


                   I hope so.










      The car half full. Kevin and Milton standing near the
      door. Right behind them, three guys in the midst of an
      intense conversation in Spanish.


                   So what's this Weaver Commission?


                   I don't micro-manage. You find the
                   talent and then you delegate. Who
                   knows what the hell Eddie's up to.
                   He's got a lotta fingers in a lotta pies.

      Suddenly, one of the guys behind them, the biggest of the
      three, we'll call him BIG GUY, turns back --


                   What the fuck you looking at?
                          (it's Milton he's
                           talking to)
                   You fucking deaf or something?


                   No.    I can hear you just fine.


                   Good, 'cause I want you should get
                   your skinny little ass somewhere
                   down the fucking car away from me.








                          
                   I'm not going anywhere.

      Big Guy pulls open his jacket -- a knife in his belt.


                   Oh, shit.
                           
                   John...

      But Milton doesn't move.     He smiles.


                          
                   Maricela, the moment you left the
                   apartment she was upstairs with
                   Carlos. They're on the pipe right
                   now, my friend. They're in the
                   kitchen splitting a jumbo and then
                   he's going to fuck her in the ass,
                   right on your bed, and she's going
                   to like it.

      Big Guy backing away -- into his friends --


                   Como...?   How do you...?

      The SUBWAY RATTLING into the Fourteenth Street station.


                          
                   Do yourself a favor and put that
                   knife where it belongs.

      The doors open. Big Guy stumbling back -- his friends
      catching him -- helping him off the train -- looking
      back, as the doors close and...

      It's like it never happened. Milton straightening his
      cuffs as the train pulls away.


                   What did you say to him?


                   I told him if he didn't leave us
                   alone, you were going to kick all
                   three of their asses.

      Right INTO it. Red trunks with a huge right hand and
      blue trunks drops and the Garden goes wild -- five
      thousand people yelling for blood.




      And Milton at ringside, breathing deeply of the vibe
      and --


                       
                Get up! Get up, dammit!     C'mon!




      Blue trunks rises on shaky legs as the BELL RINGS, the
      round over and the crowd groans back into its seats.




      Milton turning as DON KING collars him.


                Look at this sorry shit, you got
                better seats than me.


                You need a better lawyer.

      Kevin shaking hands with Don King, as we --






      Serious flamenco. Music is loud. The dancer is
      fantastic. Deep reds. Deep blacks. Skin. Duende.

      Milton, sitting beside some blonde he's discovered, he's
      got his jacket off, clapping perfectly to the beat.
      Behind him, a large table of ten/fifteen people. Food
      and wine to excess. Laughter and music and...

       Kevin on a pay phone near the kitchen.


                 And say what? He's the senior

                 Mare, you're really starting to

                 Yes. I'm having one cigarette.
                 You want me to lie? One cigarette
                 after seven months is not --
                        
                 That's exactly what I'm saying.
                 Go to bed. I have no idea.
                        
                 I told you, he never sleeps.
                        
                 Mare. Stop. The guy pays our
                 bills. The food, the heat, the
                 rent on that enormous fucking
                 apartment we live in.
                        
                 I live there, too!

       CLICK. The LINE is dead. He looks at the cigarette.
       Takes a hit. Fuck it. And then his eyes find --

       The dressing room across the hall. An open door.
       Inside, a woman, one of the dancers, all but nude,
       stepping into her dress. A simply perfect body.

       And then she turns TOWARD us and it's Christabella --
       clearly -- for a single moment -- before she slams shut
       the door.

       Kevin crosses to the door.   Knocks.   And again.

       The door opens.   A DANCER standing there.    It's not
       Christabella.


                 Can I help you?

       Kevin already backing toward --




       Kevin moving toward the Milton table.    Sitting down and
       just realizing that --

       Cullen has joined the party.   He's wasted.   He waves.

       below the table. As if nothing were going on.

       Dark. Mary Ann asleep in a chair. A breeze through the
       open terrace windows. Suddenly she wakes.


                    Kevin?

       Silence.   And then, the sound of a BABY CRYING...






       Mary Ann rushing through the dark, toward the nursery and
       the sound of the CRYING -- stopping suddenly at the
       nursery door --


                    How...?   What are you...?




       A one-year-old child sits naked on the floor amidst the
       tools and material.

       Mary Ann easing slowly forward.

                    do you have there?

       The baby offers his open hands --

       Viscera. Entrails and blood and slime.        The child's
       hands full of someone's insides...


                    ... Oh, God, no...

       The baby raising his hands toward her --


                    ... no... please, God, no --

       Stopping suddenly as she looks down at her body. Her

                   Your wife, the day she was killed,
                   had lunch with a friend. She says

                   Your prenuptial agreement is on

       A Towncar pulls up. Mary Ann, Kevin and Mrs. Lomax
       emerge. Just back from dinner. Two steps and --

       A PAPARAZZI photographer nearby --


                 Kevin, hey, how's it going? Can
                 we get a couple shots here? How
                 about a thumbs-up here? What do
                 you say?

       Kevin reluctantly smiles.   Get it over with.


                 What's he doing?


                 Kevin's had his picture in the
                 paper.

       FEENEY, the doorman, at the ready. Mary Ann first inside.
       Mrs. Lomax lingers a moment watching Kevin have his
       picture taken.


                 Welcome to Babylon, Ma.


                 Sorry, Mr. Lomax, I thought we'd
                 scared 'em all away...


                 Always did like to stick his nose
                 in a camera.





                        
                 And how are you, Mrs. Lomax?   Did
                 you have a fine dinner?


                 I surely did.
                        (she's got a
                         doggie bag)

                 No, I'm fine.    Thank you.

      There he is, waiting for the elevator. With him are
      Christabella and an Asian woman who is so sexy it hurts.
      Kevin off balance from this moment on.

      Mary Ann smells the danger.       Everything is awkward.


                   I was just telling the Moyez
                   story.


                   Really.


                   And is this your mother?


                   Yes.   Mom, this is...


                   John Milton.    Nice to meet you.

                   I think you've met Christabella,
                   and this is Giselle who's just in
                   from Paris.

      A moment of bullshit superficial greetings and then --
      the elevator doors opening and the whole uncomfortable
      clot of them moving into --




      Just enough room.       They ascend.


                   Thanks for the champagne.

                   Cette femme, elle est la mere de

                   She can't believe you're his
                   mother. You've done one helluva
                   job bringing him up, Mrs. Lomax.
                   I'm sure it wasn't easy.


                   No.

      Mrs. Lomax has been staring, and now Milton meets her
      eyes as the elevator stops and the doors open.


                   Nice to see you...


                   Have a lovely evening.

      Kevin next out, holding the door, waiting --


                   Mom, we're here...


                   Yes.   Good night to you.

      Mrs. Lomax takes one last look at Milton as she exits.


                   Kevin, hang on...
                          
                   How's Cullen. Everything on beam?


                   That's a long conversation.

      In the b.g., Mary Ann opening the apartment door and
      going inside. Mrs. Lomax right behind her.


                          
                   Why don't you come on up?


                   Now?

      Milton smiles.      Christabella smiles.   Giselle smiles.


                   Let's talk tomorrow.

       Milton shrugs. Your loss. Christabella has her hand on
       Giselle's ass, working up her skirt --


                    You sure?

       Kevin left standing there as the doors close.

       Mrs. Lomax, subdued, listening to Kevin and Mary Ann
       bickering.


                    That what you're doing when you're
                    working late?


                    What are we talking about?


                    You know exactly what I'm talking
                    about.


                    That's ridiculous.

                   I'm worried about her. You
                   shouldn't fight like that.


                   That's not a fight, Ma, it's
                   marriage. Not exactly your area
                   of expertise.


                   Are you happy here?


                   What?


                   Are you happy here?


                   You're kidding, right? Am I happy?
                   Every now and then I look around
                   and I think my mama must be praying
                   awful hard for me, 'cause I died
                   and went to heaven. Am I happy?


                   You were always running somewhere.


                   I guess I finally got there.

                   So stay. Take care of her if
                   you're so concerned! Help me out.


                   I'll take her home if you let me.


                   This is home. You understand?

                request, Your Honor. We're
                specifically asking for any and
                all documents relating to Devada
                Holdings. It's taken six months
                and seventeen separate motions and
                we still don't know who's
                responsible here. We've got a

                   in the tub. Okay?


                   You won't stay. I know you.

                   Why? What is it now? What the
                   fuck is it today, Mare? I swear
                   to God, I'm calling this doctor,
                   I'm gonna find out what the hell
                   they're giving you.

                   between them. My mother had Derek
                   when she was forty-five. You
                   could set a clock by my periods.


                   What are you talking about?


                   I can't have children!


                   Says who?

                   What about Cullen?


                   We'll find someone new. You
                   consult. You live to fight
                   another day.

                   man. And she's very sick.    And

                   of leaving the case has never

                   You know what scares me? I quit
                   the case. She gets better. And I
                   hate her for it.
                          
                   I don't want to resent her, John.
                   I've got a winner here. I gotta
                   nail this fucker down, do it
                   fast, and put it behind me.
                   Just get it done. Then put all
                   my energy into her.

      Packed. JUDGE ARMAND POE presiding. Cullen seated with
      Kevin and Pam. The jury in their box. And prosecutor FRANK
      BROYGO on his feet, just wrapping up his opening statement --


                 ... And when all that evidence is
                 laid before you, when all these
                 pieces weave together, you will
                 conclude -- you will know -- that
                 Alexander Cullen is guilty of
                 murdering three people in cold
                 blood with malice aforethought.

      Done.   The courtroom is silent.   The jury liked him.


                 Mr. Lomax...
                        
                 We can break for lunch now, or you
                 can do a stop and start...


                 If it's a choice, I'll go now. I
                 won't be as long as Mr. Broygo.


                 Proceed.


                 We just spent our morning listening
                 to Mr. Broygo talk about his
                 'evidence'. What he neglected to
                 tell you is what this case is
                 really about. He left out the most
                 important fact of all: Alex Cullen
                 was somewhere else when these
                 murders took place. Now, Alex
                 Cullen has done a lot of things I
                 don't like. He's been a terrible
                 husband to all three of his wives.
                 He's been a destructive force in
                 the lives of his step-children.
                 He's cheated the city. His partners.
                 His employees. He's paid hundreds of
                 thousands of dollars in penalties and
                 fines over the years. I don't like
                 those things. I don't expect you to
                 like them. There will be other things
                 during the course of this trial that
                 you will hear about and like even
                 less. But this isn't a popularity
                 contest. It's a murder trial and
                 Alex Cullen hasn't killed anybody.

                   at this case. I need one thing
                   from you. That's it. One thing.
                   I need you to ask yourself, 'Is
                   not liking this man reason
                   enough to convict him of

                with as many people as I have over

                    overplayed his hand. Maybe he
                    made the game a little too
                    interesting...




       Barzoon turns back -- stumbles -- catches himself --
       sprinting now to the Pump House. He pulls up here.
       Resting as several other runners pass by. Glancing back,
       almost an afterthought and --




       Those three running shadows are now crossing the bridge
       which is completely impossible considering where they
       just were a moment ago and --




       Barzoon starts running again -- instinctively -- faster
       than before -- glancing back and --




        The three shadows. The sun setting behind them.
       Transforming as they run -- animal shapes mixing with the
       harsh silhouettes of bare trees and --

       Barzoon freaked -- What the fuck was that? -- The park
       suddenly looking very empty -- and dark --




       The three shadows and they're closer and weirder and --




       Barzoon -- suddenly turning -- changing course -- leaving
       the path -- into the woods -- quickly ducking down beside
       a huge sycamore tree. Hiding. Sweating. Scared.
       Staring back out at the path --




       Three women runners -- clear as day -- pass beneath a
       streetlight. Team clothes. Machine-like strides. Flat-
       out. And then gone.




       Barzoon stands from behind the sycamore tree. Relief.
       Smiling at his own stupidity. What a jerk. Dusting off.
       Heading back toward the path, when --




       Suddenly, there's an arm around his neck -- throwing him
       to the ground --




       Standing there above him, a crazed-looking homeless
       MAN -- he's white and old and hungry --


                 Gimme your watch.


                        
                 You want the watch, old man?   Come
                 and get it.

      Barzoon moving toward the old guy when -- Crack! -- A
      tree branch swings out of nowhere -- catching his
      elbow -- snapping it back and --

      A second homeless man. He's black and older than the
      first guy but just as wild and dangerous and he's winding
      up to swing the branch again and --

      Barzoon on his knees -- dazed -- blood pouring from his
      head -- uncomprehending eyes watching these park
      creatures tear at his clothes --




       Watching them grow more feral and less human by the
      moment and --






      Mary Ann staring out at the park. Covering her ears
      against some horrible sound that she alone can hear.






      Barzoon -- on his belly -- in the dirt -- trying to
      move -- crawl -- anything --




      The two men beating Barzoon to death with stones --




      -- transforming with every blow --  as their hands
      descend they become terrifying, demonic creatures, and as
      they rise we see them as men and over and over, as we
      hear --

      Milton turns to find Kevin staring at him.


                I'm gonna, I'm gonna go downstairs
                now. Put this stuff away.
                       (backing away
                        with his bag
                        of groceries)
                Ice cream's already melting.

      Milton watching him walk away, as we --






      Pam exits the room. Melissa sitting at the head of the
      table. Kevin pacing around her. They are alone.
      Practicing her testimony over early morning coffee.


                You testified that the defendant
                called you at four-thirty to ask
                you to come to his office gym for
                the purposes of sex.


                Yes.


                Mr. Cullen, though, he's not just
                your lover, is he? He's the boss.


                Yes.


                So two hours go by before you act
                on his request?








                   Yes, I went up at six-ten. I knew
                   it was six-ten, they had weather
                   coming on the news. I remember --

      Cut off by --


                   Okay.  Stop.
                          
                   This prosecutor is no fool. He's
                   gonna change tempo, attitude, tone
                   of voice -- he's gonna come out
                   with questions you never thought
                   of, just to screw you up.
                          
                   So what do we do?


                   Yes and no answers. Stay calm.


                   Exactly.
                          
                   Is it your testimony, Ms. Block,
                   that between the hours of six-ten
                   and nine-forty you were engaged in
                   sexual congress with the
                   defendant?


                   Yes.


                   At any point during this three
                   hour marathon, Ms. Block, did you
                   lose sight of the defendant?


                   No.


                   Did he use the bathroom?


                   Yes.


                   Is he circumcised?
                          
                   You understand the question?


                   Yes.








                   So is he cut or not?


                   Yes.


                   Which is it?

      Silence.   Melissa looks away.


                   You've been polishing his knob
                   three times a week for six months
                   and you don't know whether or not
                   he's got foreskin?


                          
                   I've had it up to here with this
                   fucking game. Why don't you take
                   your questions and shove 'em up
                   your ass.

      Kevin staring at her.       Looking away.   Moving quickly for
      the door, and into:




      Three steps out and he stops. Something's wrong. Very
      wrong. People are out of their offices, standing in the
      doorways. Some of them crying.

      Christabella rushes toward him, into his arms --


                   Oh, Kevin --


                   What's happened?


                   Eddie Barzoon...


                   What about him?


                   He's dead.   He was killed.

      Heath nearby has more answers --


                   Last night in the park. He was
                   running if you can believe it.

      Kevin standing there, holding Christabella. Feeling heat
      on the back of his neck and turning to find Milton at the
      far end of the hall. Their eyes lock --


                   What is wrong with people?


                   At least they got the scumbags who
                   did it.


                          
                   Who?


                   Two old, homeless crazies.

      Pam coming through the hallway like steel --


                   Kevin... Kevin, I'm sorry, but
                   you're due in court in thirty
                   minutes.

      As Melissa appears in the conference room door --


                   Are we through here, or what?


                   I'll bring Melissa down in the
                   car, but you better get going.






      SCREAMING uptown. Kevin looking very rattled.      Milton,
      beside him. Talking him down.


                   I want you to put Eddie aside.
                   Let me worry about it. You gotta
                   deal with Cullen now. Marshal
                   your strength. Prioritize.
                   Conserve your energy.

                   I can't put her on the stand.


                   What choice do we have?


                   I know she's lying.


                   Because she didn't answer you fast
                   enough? Did she lie to you? No.
                   She said nothing. The fact is,
                   you'll never know.


                   He killed those people.


                   You really believe that?


                   Cullen set me up. Melissa, the
                   whole thing, I know it.


                   Look, you gotta go with your gut.


                   That's your advice?


                   I'll back you either way. Hey,
                   you think I haven't lost before?
                          
                   We talked about this, Kevin.
                   Pressure. Take a big whiff.

      Kevin unreadable.    The SUBWAY CAR RATTLING away.






      Packed and ready.


                   Mr. Lomax, you may call your next
                   witness.







      A long, awful pause. Kevin in agony. Milton behind him.
      Cullen and Pamela and everyone waiting...


                   Counselor...


                   I call Melissa Block.






      Chaos! -- media madness -- Kevin pushing past dozens of
      reporters and camera crews -- court officers trying to
      clear the way -- fifteen voices screaming at once --
      questions flying like shrapnel -- Cullen, all smiles,
      alongside Milton as they're pushed along -- Pam, waving a
      cell phone, fighting her way to Kevin and --


                   Kevin!
                          
                   Kevin, it's for you --

      Kevin takes the phone, trying to hear above the noise.






      A cab speeds to a stop. Kevin jumps out. Feeney, the
      doorman, standing there with Felix, his partner.


                   She didn't look well, sir. Felix
                   tried to talk to her, but she --


                   Where is she?






      Kevin running down the sidewalk and --







      Kevin enters. It's empty and dark. Two old ladies up
      front. Mary Ann in back, wrapped in a comforter.


                Honey...
                       (sitting
                         beside her)
                Mare. It's me.


                He let himself in. You need to
                know that. The bath running, or
                something, I didn't hear him. I
                swear to you.


                Who?


                Then we talked. We talked for
                hours.
                       (coming apart
                        for good)
                I haven't talked to anyone, really
                talked to anyone in such a long
                time. You have this whole life
                and all I have is me and he was so
                clear about it all.


                Who let himself in?


                I came down here. I've just been
                sitting. I'm afraid to pray. I
                let him stay. I'm sorry. I'm
                sorry. I'm sorry, Kevin.


                Did somebody hurt you?


                Milton. He fucked me, Kevin. I
                let him fuck me. I couldn't stop
                him.


                What?     When?


                Today. This afternoon. All
                afternoon. God, I'm so ashamed...

                   Today? Today? Today. He was in
                   court, Mare. He was in court, in
                   my presence all afternoon!


                          
                   I'm not crazy. I'm not.   I swear.


                   I don't know, Mare. I don't know
                   how much more of this I can take.

      She stands. Throws open the comforter. She is naked.
      There are scratch marks all over her body.






      Kevin with a NURSE and paperwork.


                   Sign there... And there... And one
                   more...
                           
                   She's calm now so this might be a
                   good time to say good night.

      Kevin nods.    Stands, moving now -- into --




      Mary Ann on a moving gurney. Calm now, in the sway of
      some very strong drugs. Kevin kneels beside her.


                   I know why this is happening.


                   They want you to go to sleep.


                   It's the money, Kevin. Blood
                   money. We just drank it down.
                   Both of us. We knew it. Winning
                   those cases, taking the money. We
                   knew they were guilty. But you
                   kept winning. Every time.

                   I can't look at myself in the
                   mirror, Kevin.






      A big one. A funereal morning.      Hearse and cortege
      parked on the street outside.






      Barzoon's funeral. Big deal. Big crowd. An excess of
      flowers. ORGAN MUSIC as foreplay. Milton, up front,
      seating Diana and children.

      Kevin seated on the aisle.     Beside him, Jack Heath.


                   What do they say?


                   They don't know. It's bad.   She's
                   falling apart.


                   Do you have room for one more?

      Kevin turns to see Christabella standing beside him.
      Jackie's concerned expression blossoms into a private,
      knowing smile now that Kevin has turned away.
      Christabella squeezes in, as the MUSIC SWELLS and THE
      PRIEST walks solemnly to the altar. Kevin caught in a
      high-intensity sexual cross-fire between Jackie and
      Christabella. He's tense. He's flipping out.




      Milton passes on his way to the back.     Smiles.

      On one side the Therapist, on the other Allesandra, except

      Makeup.   She could be all of seventeen.


                We are here today, to remember and
                pray and exalt in the spirit of
                Edward Barzoon...

      Kevin staring at Cullen and the girl.


                ... Father, husband, partner,
                friend, colleague...




       Cullen's hand stroking at the back of the pew --
      nothing outrageous, except it does call to mind the hand
      of Mr. Gettys back in Florida --


                ... taken from us so suddenly...

      Cullen's hand moving with purpose -- stopping --
      waiting -- as Allesandra sits back and now his fingers
      find her skin -- stroking ever so subtly --


                ... to contemplate evil. How it
                robs -- how it steals everything
                of value from us...

      Cullen turns -- except it's not Cullen, it's Gettys --
      yes, Gettys -- whispering in Allesandra's ear and --


                ... farther from God's purpose...




      Kevin out of his seat. Pushing past Christabella --
      rushing up the aisle --


                ... and the greater that distance,
                the greater evil's pleasure...





      Milton watching Kevin flee the church.






      Moments later.   Kevin hustling away --


                       
                Mr. Lomax?


                No comment. I'll have something
                for you later.


                I'm a friend of Eddie Barzoon.

      Kevin turns.   Weaver walking beside him.


                Remember me? Mitch Weaver.
                Justice Department.


                Staking out the funeral?


                Looking for you actually.


                I'm in a bit of a hurry right now.
                I need to talk to my wife.


                Just wanted to ask you -- off the
                record -- I had a few questions
                about Eddie.






      The funeral. In progress. CHOIR and ORGAN getting
      LOUDER. We're watching Milton move in the back of the
      church.







      Kevin walking faster.    Weaver right beside him.


                Milton, Chadwick, Waters is a
                little more than a law firm, but

      Stained glass.   Angels.    The Stations of the Cross.




      Milton standing in the shadows at the back.      Taking it
      all in. Prodigal angel.




       And then, the stained-glass angels begin to move.
      Wings begin to beat. Expressions come alive.
      Expressions of panic and fear and --






      Kevin really striding.     Weaver right there.


                Milton is into everything.
                       
                Barzoon was coming in, Kevin.     He
                was gonna testify.

      Weaver left standing there, as Kevin rushes away --
      through traffic -- across the street --

      Kevin, across the street, stops.

      Kevin standing there, across the street -- Weaver smiles,
      thinking he'll talk now for sure -- stepping off the
      curb and --

      TIRES SCREECHING and Weaver turning and --

                    What are you doing? Help her!


                    Hey, look, I ain't no doctor...
                           
                    Hang on -- lemme --

       YELLING in the hall now, and faces in the doorway. Mrs.
       Lomax crying and two weird patients from the next staring
       and...

       Pam.   And only we can see it, but she's smiling...


                    -- please, baby, stay with me...
                    it'll be okay -- it's gonna be fine
                    just, just stay with me -- Oh God,
                    Mare... please, baby...

       Kevin holding her, but she's gone, as we --





thru                                                                      thru





       But someplace completely different. Older.        Dark.   Empty.
       Echoey. A fluorescent bulb sputtering out.

       FOOTSTEPS approaching...

       It's Kevin. And we know instantly that Mary Ann is dead.
       There's blood on his shirt. His eyes are raw. At his
       side, a small suitcase containing her personal effects.
       More than grief, more than shock, what we notice most is
       his frighteningly grim determination.

       Up ahead, a bench. Mrs. Lomax huddled here. Cried out.
       Empty. Holding herself more tightly as he sets down the
       suitcase.


                    I could've packed that up for you.

       Kevin sits.    If he loses his steel he'll drown.

                   I wish you'da let me help you.


                   Finish the story.
                          
                   Nineteen-sixty-four. You're in
                   New York. There's a waiter in a
                   restaurant.
                          
                   Finish the story.


                   He talked to me. Nobody'd ever
                   really talked to me before. Sixteen
                   years old, a thousand miles away
                   from home, somebody takes an
                   interest... Working so hard,
                   putting himself through school,
                   I'd never met anybody like that.
                   Knew the Bible, every word, just
                   knew it by heart. Every meal,
                   there he was, at my ear and I
                   just... I didn't want that week to
                   ever end. But it did. He came to
                   say goodbye, it was late, and I
                   started to cry and he said not to
                   worry, 'Behold, I send you out as
                   sheep amidst the wolves.' And that
                   just stopped me cold because we'd
                   spent that whole day at Bible study
                   reading Matthew Ten and there was
                   just no way for him to know about
                   that, so I was... I took it as a
                   sign. I let him in. And then
                   everything was different. He was
                   cruel. He was so cruel and I was
                   so ashamed, I thought I'd die...

      Kevin's eyes settle on the suitcase.      Mary Ann...


                   I promised right there if God would
                   let me back into His grace I would
                   never leave again. I prayed there
                   was a reason this terrible thing
                   had happened. There had to be a
                   reason. And there was. It was
                   you. You were my blessing. You
                   were reason enough to endure
                   anything. How much I love you.


                   I want to hear you say it.

                   His face -- that night -- I knew
                   it was him and the same time I was
                   confused -- and you were so proud
                   you'd come to New York and done all
                   this on your own, I didn't have the
                   heart to tell you --


                   Say it.

                   apartment, the money, all this
                   attention, everything out of

                   Milton. He's your father.

                           out loud)
                   Somehow he found us. Tracked you
                   down.


                   No.


                   What do you mean?


                   He's always been there. I know
                   that now. Watching. Waiting.
                   He's been playing us like a game.
                   Jerking us around. Destroying Mary
                   Ann...

      Kevin stands.      Quiet fury.   A machine.


                   What are you doing?


                   I gotta go.


                   No... let it alone! Stay with me.
                          
                   Forget about him! We can leave
                   here. We can go home! We don't
                   ever have to see him again!

                   I can't do that. You go home.

                   I love you!

      Kevin disappearing down the stairs. Mrs. Lomax dropping
      to her knees as his FOOTSTEPS ECHO away, and we --






      As Kevin explodes through a fire door.   Pam standing
      there, having a smoke.


                   There you are...
                          
                   Look at you... you're terrified.
                   Not to worry. He'll take that fear
                   away. You don't ever have to be
                   frightened again. Go on, he's
                   waiting...

      Kevin turning and something is very wrong --




      Fifty-seventh Street is empty. No cars. No people.
      Just the building and the silence. Turning back and
      Pam is gone, and then --

      And then a WIDER ANGLE -- it goes on and on... He's alone.
      Just now realizing the scale of Milton's power. Starting
      to walk, as we --






      The room's only light coming from the huge bas relief.
      Kevin steps off the elevator, into the room.

                   You're right about one thing... I
                   have been watching. Couldn't help
                   myself. Watching, waiting, holding
                   my breath. But I'm no puppeteer,
                   Kevin...

      Milton appears out of nowhere.       Walking past Kevin.


                   ... I don't make things happen.
                   Doesn't work like that. Free
                   will -- it's like butterfly wings --
                   one touch and it never gets off the
                   ground. I only set the stage. You
                   pull your own strings.

      Kevin has a gun -- Cullen's gun, in his hand --


                   What did you do to Mary Ann?


                   A gun?   In here?


                   What did you do to my wife?


                   On a scale of one to ten, ten
                   being the most depraved acts of

                   average Friday night run-through
                   at the Lomax household, I'd say...
                          
                   Six.

      Kevin FIRES the GUN -- BANG! BANG! BANG! -- bullets pass
      right through him -- into the wall --


                   Whoa... Got me! Damn!
                          
                   That's my boy. Step on up! Stay
                   angry! Keep hold to that great
                   fury! Hang on tight, Kevin, because
                   it's the final fig leaf.

                   Come on. You're not listening.
                   Blaming me for Mary Ann? I hope
                   you're kidding. You could've saved
                   her any time you liked. She only
                   wanted love. But you knew it
                   wouldn't really work out, didn't
                   you? Mary Ann in New York? Face
                   it, you started looking to better-
                   deal her the minute you got here.


                   That's a lie.


                   Hey, it's not that you didn't care
                   for her, it's just you were a
                   little bit more involved with
                   someone else. Yourself.

                   delusion. I told you to take care
                   of your wife -- that the world
                   would understand. And you made a
                   choice. 'You know what scares me,
                   John? I leave the case, she gets
                   better and I hate her for it...'

                   for Mr. Gettys? And Moyez -- the
                   direction you took -- Snake
                   handlers, Popes and swamis all
                   feeding at the same trough -- whose
                   ideas were those? And then
                   Cullen -- knowing he's guilty --
                   seeing those pictures -- putting
                   that lying bitch on the stand...
                   What did I say, Kevin? Maybe it was
                   time to lose, right? You didn't
                   think so.

                   strongest. And believe me, I
                   understand. Work for someone
                   else? -- Hey, I couldn't hack it.

                That church she dragged you to?
                Every day? What training. What

                   God's your prankster, my boy.
                   Think of it. He gives man
                   instincts. He gives you this
                   extraordinary gift and then, I
                   swear to you -- for his own
                   amusement -- his own private,
                   cosmic gag reel -- he sets the
                   rules in opposition. It's the
                   goof of all time. Look but don't
                   touch. Touch but don't taste.
                   Taste but don't swallow. And
                   while you're jumping from one foot
                   to the other he's laughing his
                   sick fucking ass off! He's a
                   tight-ass. He's a sadist. He's
                   an absentee landlord!
                          
                   Worship that? Never.

                   I'm here, on the ground, my nose
                   in it since the whole damn thing
                   began. Why? Because I worship
                   man himself. And it's my time
                   now. Our time.


                   Anybody want a drink? I'm having
                   a drink.


                   This is some pitch. You must need
                   me pretty bad. What do you want?


                   Eddie was right. Your name is on
                   the partnership charter. I want
                   you to take over the firm. You
                   and your sister.


                   Is that it?

                   Your vanity is justified, Kevin,
                   you're the seed to a new future.
                   Your son will sit at the head of
                   all tables. You hold a special
                   place in the history of all things.

                   Free will. It's a bitch.
                          
                   I need a family. I command an ever
                   larger presence on the board. I'm
                   busy and I need some help. There's
                   a plan here. I've been conserving
                   my energy. Synergy. Prioritize.
                   It's the millennium, Kevin. Title
                   fight. Round twenty. I'm ready
                   to work.


                   So what are you offering?

       Christabella passing Kevin, handing him her bra.


                    It's done.    Forget it. It's all
                    for us now.

                   You're right. I wanted to fuck
                   her from the minute we met.


                   Like that's wrong. Like there's
                   anything wrong with that. That
                   there could be laws preventing
                   something so natural. That's
                   our ticket in.
                          
                   Did you know there were more

                   than lawyers walking the Earth?




       The Bas Relief has become an orgy, bodies coming to
      life in a swirling, narcotic haze and --





                   We're coming out, guns blazing.
                   The two of you -- all of us --
                   acquittal after acquittal until
                   the stench of it reaches so high
                   into heaven it chokes the whole
                   fucking lot of them! What we
                   cannot legislate we will buy. What
                   we cannot buy we will degrade. We
                   will blow every fuse of enlightenment
                   until it looks like a vandalized,
                   neon sign! And while God is busy
                   at his peephole -- as he deigns us
                   with his disapproval -- as he
                   lumbers around his empty kingdom
                   like some overfed colonial governor --
                   as God sleeps late, we will win.

      Kevin raises the GUN to his temple -- quick and simple --
      SNAP! -- he's blown his brains out --

      Milton stunned -- disbelieving for a moment and then an
      aura of fire and heat explodes around him --

       Milton as his clothes burn away -- as the heat eats
      away his features --





       as he becomes younger and younger and younger,
      until suddenly --




       For a moment. He is an angel. An instant of
      exquisite perfection amidst the flames. And then, just
      as  --




       suddenly -- HE EXPLODES! -- and we --






       The Bas Relief freezing instantly back into stone
      -- trapped in tortured, agonizing finality.




       And then, the whole thing just crumbling.   Stone
      raining down in tiny pieces and --






       Kevin in SUPER SLOW MOTION as he falls the final
      few inches to the floor and at the moment of impact we
      hear the sound of THUNDER and we --






      The mirror. And Kevin's face. As THUNDER ECHOES AWAY
      and becomes nothing more than a FLUSHING URINAL.

      We're back in Florida. Where we started. Kevin touches
      his face. His body. His head. He's alive. He touches
      the mirror. He's insane. He's here. It's now.    WATER
      RUNNING in the sink.








                          
                   It was a nice run. Kev. Had to
                   close out someday. Nobody wins
                   'em all.

      The Reporter exits.    Kevin alone with the mirror and his
      reflection.

      And then it's over. He's made his decision. Replacing
      his wedding ring. Reaching for his jacket, as we --






      Kevin walking through. His game face.     A court officer
      opening the doors and --






      Kevin entering. Standing there a moment. Searching for
      Heath in the back of the courtroom. He's not there. A
      single empty seat.

      Kevin moving quickly down the aisle.

      Mary Ann standing there, completely unprepared as Kevin
      comes in behind her. Embracing her. Holding her tightly
      to him with a fervor that we alone will understand.


                   Honey, what are you doing?
                          
                   Are you okay?

      Kevin nods. Smiles. Backs away. Into his seat.        Gettys
      there beside him. Kevin will not look at him.


                   All rise for the honorable Justice
                   Garson Deeds.

      The Judge enters.    Takes his seat.


                          
                   You're still under oath, young
                   lady.









                          
                   Your witness, Mr. Lomax.


                   Your Honor, I'm terribly sorry,
                   but I can no longer represent my
                   client. I need to be replaced as
                   counsel.

      Another silence. But this one isn't very long. There
      will be chaos in the courtroom. Gettys will freak out
      and the press will start running for the phones and the
      Judge will be banging that gavel, as we --






      As the doors open and the chaos begins to spill into the
      hallway. Kevin trying to rush away with Mary Ann but
      right behind them --


                   Kevin! -- Hey!
                          
                   Listen, this story -- this is the
                   one, pal -- this is the one you
                   dream about --


                   There is no story.


                   Bullshit. A lawyer with a crisis
                   of conscience? You gotta be
                   kidding. It's huge!


                   They're gonna disbar me, Larry.
                   You can cover that.


                   Can they do that?


                   Not when I get through with the
                   story.
                          
                   You gotta talk, Kevin. You gotta
                   gimme an exclusive.









                   This is wire service.     This is
                   'Sixty Minutes'. This     is a story
                   that needs to be told.     It's you!
                   You're a star!


                   Call me tomorrow.


                   You got it.   First thing.

      Kevin nods.    Holding Mary Ann's hand as they escape.




      The Reporter watching them go for a moment.         Then turning
      back.




       And as he does, his features change, transforming - - like
      that -- into Milton.




      It's Milton.

      Always there.

      And he smiles.    And we FREEZE FRAME.
