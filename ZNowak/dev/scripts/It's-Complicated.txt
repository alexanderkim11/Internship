    A late afternoon sky, a red tile roof and the Santa Barbara
    coast line frame this party of old friends. A trio plays           
    Brazilian music as guests carry drinks and nibble on dessert.      



    The Couple who live in this house, SALLY AND TED, drink
    champagne as they chat with their closest friends, JANE AND        


    JANE is mid-fifties and has embraced that fact. She knows 50
    is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described
    by all who know her as beautiful. Everything about this
    woman's appearance screams "solid."

    The years have been good to JAKE. He's never lost his looks,
    his killer smile, or his ability to charm. He lifts his
    glass of champagne.                                                

               Happy happy happy...


                   
               -- Anniversary.

    Jake pauses, wryly turns to Jane, making her smile.


               Some things never change.


               Thank God.


               I thought maybe you were drifting.


               He was pausing.


               Exactly....
                   
               Happy... Anniversary. You two have
               led an extraordinarily blessed
               life.


                    JAKE
          As long as I've known you both,
          you've always managed to somehow do
          everything entirely right.


          -- That's so true.


          But, honestly, how can it be thirty
          years!?!   When did we do that trip
          to Spain?
              
          It was for both of our what..?


          -- Fifteenth anniversaries.


          God, that was a great trip...

The Two Women exchange a quick look when a tall, ADORABLE 21    
YEAR OLD BOY joins the group, holding a bottle of beer. This
is OLIVER, Sally and Ted's son. All four light up as Oliver
puts his arm around his Mom.


          Ollie, how was graduation?


          It was fantastic. I can't believe
          I'm not in school anymore. When's
          Luke's graduation?


          Next week.


              
          It's in three days!


          Sorry!   I mean this week.


          Are the girls going?


          They can't wait.                                      
Jane glances across the party and sees AGNESS, A FREE           
SPIRITED PRETTY WOMAN in her thirties, wearing a sarong over    
a bathing suit and walking directly toward them. She carries    
a slice of cake. Jane becomes instantly distracted and          
uncomfortable.





          How long is Luke home before he has
          to go back for work?


          -- Only a week...                                

          Aw, that's it?                                   

          I know, I hate it. Well...
              (Agness joins the group,                     
               standing next to Jake)                      
          Congrats again...
              
          Great party...


          You're leaving?


          Yeah, I have some
              (Agness hands Jake a piece
               of cake. Jane works hard
               at not appearing
               flustered)
          -- stuff I have to get done tonight
          for work...
              
          I'll see you two in New York.


          Absolutely. Lookin' forward to it.


          Good.    Well....


          -- Jane, what are you wearing to                 
          the graduation?


          Oh, a suit or dress, probably a
          suit.


          Fancy.    Okay.

Jane smiles tightly, raises her eyebrows to Sally.





          See you there, Janey.    Where are
          you staying again?


          We're at The Park Regent. You said                 
          you were at The Four Seasons,                      
          right?


          I don't know.
              
          Where are we?


          We're at The Park Regent too.                      

              
          Oh. Good.     That'll be convenient,
          actually.     Okay, so, see you soon..             
              


          -- I'll walk you out.

As they WALK AWAY, they HEAR:


          So, Ted, do you think you can help
          us get Pedro into El Montecito for
          kindergarten?




              
          I thought it was sweet how well you
          and Jake were getting along. Felt
          like old times.


          Yeah, well, we know how to do this
          by now. It has been ten years.                     

          That's crazy.

Jane hugs Sally good bye, her eyes landing on Agness         
affectionately rubbing Jake's back.                          







    as it closes after Jane.




    and sees Jane is gone.





    in jeans and a tank top CARRYING A CARTON OF BOOKS, A YOGA
    MAT AND A SMALL LAMP. Gabby is Jane and Jake's middle child.       
    But unlike most middle children, this one has never suffered
    from being ignored. Not a possibility with Jane as your
    mother. We are:




    The house is modest and charming and sits on a few acres in
    the lush green hills of Santa Barbara. Neat rows of
    vegetables dot the landscape.

    Gabby arrives at her already packed Prius, where her OLDER         
    SISTER, LAUREN, 26, is trying to fit everything into the
    trunk. Lauren is more conservatively dressed than Gabby and        
    has an air of maturity about her.


              Gabby, stop...you're never going to                      
              fit all this in... you can come                          
              back for the rest tomorrow.


              I can't come back t---

    Gabby looks up to see HARLEY, LAUREN'S FIANCE, in a T-shirt        
    and over-the-knee gym shorts, lugging a huge suitcase down
    the front path, a duffel strapped across his chest.                

              Oh, God...that's all my clothes.


                  (sets the suitcase down as
                   he sees an SUV heading to
                   the house)


                    HARLEY
          Okay, your Mom is home. She'll                        
          figure this out.

The SUV pulls to a stop, Jane gets out. Gabby starts pulling    
cartons out of her trunk to make room for her clothes.          

          Gabby, you're leaving now? I                          
          thought you were going in the
          morning?


          I know but my friends are all there
          and they wanted me to come tonight.


          But honey, it's gonna get dark
          soon. You can't see out the back
          window. It's Saturday night.
          People will be on the road
          drinking...


          Mom, she'll be there in a couple of
          hours, she'll be fine.


          Okay, I'm leaving this stuff here.
          I'll be back for it in a few days.


          Want me to drive it down in the
          morning?
              (Gabby's BLACKBERRY                               
               BUZZES, she laughs,                              
               thumbs flying)                                   
          I could be there by lunch. We could
          go to that big Bed, Bath, and
          Beyond, buy kitchen stuff... Gabby,                   
          can you look up from that thing??


              
          I got it covered, Ma.
              
          Hey gangsta, help me carry these...


              
          Yep....

Gabby and Harley CARRY THE BOXES back into the house.   Jane    
seems worried as she watches them.                              





          Mom, are you afraid to sleep in the                     
          house alone?


          What are you....? No!
              
          -- I'm not! One of you is always                        
          moving out...                                           
                                                  
          But I am wondering who I'm gonna
          watch The Hills with?



              
          Mamacita... I'm gonna miss you.

Jane hugs her back, but is aware of not hugging too hard.         
Harley joins the group.                                           

          Omigod. L.A.! Okay. I'm doing
          this.
              
          Mom, you don't happen to know where
          Dad is, do you? I tried calling
          him to say goodbye...


          He was at Sally and Ted's.


          He was? How was that? You and
          them at the same --                                     
                                               
          -- not that it's in any way, any of                     
          my... was just...                                       

          -- It was....                                           
              (notices both girls wait
               for her answer)
          -- whatever. It was fine.


          Was her lunatic child there?


              
          Not this time. Gabby, call me when                      
          you get there. Do NOT forget.


                        JANE
                  (Gabby texts, deep in                                    
                   convo )
              Gabby!                                                       

              I will. I'll call you!                                       

              Knock `em dead, little one.


              And call us when you get there,
              too. And no texting and driving.

    Jane loves that Harley said that. Gabby gets in her car and            
    starts off.


                  (puts his arm around
                   Jane's shoulder)
              They grow up so friggin' fast. I
              hate it.                                                     
    Gabby pulls out of the driveway and out of sight.                      

              Maybe you should get a dog.


              Oh my God.     Goodbye you two.   Love
              you.


                  (heading for their car and
                   getting into the
                   passenger seat)
              Love you boss!

    As Lauren and Harley drive off,    Jane turns and looks at her
    suddenly very empty nest.



    A Woman's house. Books and art collected over years.
    Interesting, unexpected pieces of furniture. Jane kicks off
    her heels, now feeling short and alone. Deep breath!



    Cramped, but clearly a cook's kitchen.      The Kids have left a       
    few glasses and plates on the island.



    Jane gathers them and as she rinses them at the sink, she          
    suddenly and surprisingly feels very alone. She pauses,            
    allows herself the moment, then forces herself to snap out of      
    it.                                                                



    This is Jane's other home. A large, bright, bustling
    BAKERY/RESTAURANT. The bakery counter could rival any in
    Paris. Last year, The New York Times rated Jane's pain au          
    chocolat the best in the United States. A line waits to get
    in.

    A very relaxed Jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving
    between her young staff. The atmosphere is efficient and           
    friendly.

    Jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside
    the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with
    powdered sugar. She carries the tray to the open pass-
    through to the BUSY KITCHEN and calls to the head Baker.


              Reynaldo...
                  


              Too much sugar.


              Little bit.                                              
    Reynaldo nods as Jane hands him the tray.                          
    Jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter.
    Knowing what to do, Jane's staff has already set out cups of
    coffee with lids.


              Who wants coffee while they're
              waiting?

    Jane and the staff hand out the free coffee.



    refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.               

                  (quietly to a Young                                  
                   Employee)
              Check on table five, will you?                           




    The Young Employee nods as Jane looks up and sees a MAN on         
    the other side of the counter. They exchange polite hellos         
    when Jane notices PETER, tan and confident, approaching her.       

                                                           
              Peter!

    PETER joins ADAM, the man who stands across from Jane. Adam        
    is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. There's                
    something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. He
    holds rolled blueprints.


              Jane, I can't remember, have you                         
              ever met Adam Schaeffer?                                 

    No.                             Yes.



              Well....                                                 
                                                    

              Look what we've got.                                     

                  
              Your plans.                                              

                  
              So excited!



    A farmhouse table almost fills the room. On the walls,
    posters for Jane's two cookbooks, framed food photos and a
    few reviews.

    Jane, Peter, and Adam sit around the table as Adam rolls out
    the blueprints in front of Jane.


                  
              I've been thinking about this
              addition for ten years.                                  

    Peter and Adam watch as Jane's eagle eye examines the plan.





          Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh, niiice....I
          like this wall of windows, Peter.


          That was Adam actually.


          Oh.
              (still perusing, then to
               Peter)
          Love where you put the stairs.
          That's so good!


          Adam's idea...

Did she hear that?


          Oh my God, the kitchen! Finally -                      
          I have a real kitchen with four                        
          walls... It's...oh, wow...you                          
          actually understood what I wanted!

Jane looks to Peter with enormous appreciation.   Peter looks    
to Adam.


          All Adam.                                              
Jane turns to Adam.                                              

          I'm happy you like it.


                                           
          Okay. Hi.                                              
              


              
          Hello.


          You read all my e-mails.


          All 47 of them.                                        




Jane smiles as her Office Manager sticks her head in the          
door.


          Jane, it's 10:15.


          It is?
              
          Oh, sorry, I have a 10:30...
          dentist. Can you leave these and
          I'll make a few notes? Well,
          actually, I have one tiny note now.
              
          In my bathroom...um...no his and
          her sinks.


          Okay, sure. No his?


          Just hers.


          And you don't think in the future
          you might want a his?


          Oh, God, we're talking code about
          my life, right?


              
          No, no, didn't mean to be.


          The truth is, in my current                             
          bathroom, I have two sinks and                          
          sometimes the other sink makes me
          feel bad.


          One sink. Not a problem. Can we
          schedule a meeting for next week?
          Does Tuesday work for you?                              

          Tuesday's great. Eight-thirty too                       
          early? At the house?


          I'll be there.






    Way too chic for a dentist's office. Jane sits nervously in
    a chair in a well styled, well upholstered examination room.
    The door opens quickly and a handsome, crisp looking DOCTOR



              Hi.


              Hi. I'm Dr. Moss.


                  
              Hi. Jane Adler. So, I just wanted
              to start with... and please don't
              take this the wrong way but I'm the
              type of person who kind of makes
              fun of people who get plastic
              surgery.


              I understand.


              You do? Good, because, you know,
              some women can look a little fake                        
              and plasticky. And in my opinion --
              worse.


              I agree.


              Oh, that's good, so, well, as
              against the whole thing as I am, I
              do have a problem that's been
              bugging me. My left eyelid is
              really saggy. I find I'm sometimes
              holding it up when I'm watching TV
              or reading and I was wondering if
              that's something you could fix.


                  
              It's resting on your eye lashes.                         

              Is it?





                   (measures her lids with a
                    very tiny ruler)
               Actually you have the same amount
               of excess skin on both sides.


               I do? Well, I'm only interested in
               fixing one eye.                                       

               Jane, what you need to fix this is
               a brow lift.


               A brow lift? Wh-what is that
               exactly?


               We surgically cut at your hair
               line. Incision goes right across                      
               here.                                                 
                   (demonstrates on himself
                     by indicating a line
                     drawn like a headband)
               Then we just lift the skin up a
               little tighter across the skull.
                   (Jane nods, already hating
                     this)
               We staple it back in place right
               above your ears. Recovery isn't
               all that bad but you could be
               fairly numb and you'll probably                       
               have a headache that lasts anywhere
               from say 3 to 6 months.



     Jane flies into the elevator, out of breath and a little
     nauseous. She taps on the Lobby button.   The elevator moves
     down. PING. The DOORS OPEN and Jane looks into an empty
     hallway, facing a SIGN that reads, Santa Barbara Fertility
     Center. Helping Couples Become Parents.

     Jane hears someone is about to get on the elevator, steps
     back toward the corner. A messy looking 5 YEAR OLD BOY          
     dashes in. Jane recognizes him. She looks up and Jake and
     his wife, Agness, in oversized dark shades and a long black     
     dress  get on the elevator, obviously      
     mid-argument.




Agness' mood seems very dark today. They instantly shut up
when they realize Jane is in the elevator.


          Jane!


          -- Hey..                                               

          Hiii.


          Hello.


              (pushing the Lobby button,
               mumbles)
          -- Perfect.


          Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake. Jake.


          Hold on Pedro, I'm talking to
          someone.

Pedro sits on the floor, crashing into the back wall of the
elevator.


          Pedro, up! Now!!                                       
              

Jane unconsciously holds up her left eyebrow.


          What are you doing in this
          building?


          Dentist.


          You don't go to Sharon anymore?


          Uh, no... changed.

Jane looks at the fertility literature in Jake's hand just as
Jake slips it behind his back. An awful two seconds of
silence, then Jane notices a tattoo of a tiger on Agness'
back. It creeps her out.



     Jake catches Jane's reaction, then thank God the doors open.
     Jake leans down and picks up Pedro who instantly climbs up      
     his back.                                                       

               Honey, don't do that..

11   As they all EXIT THE ELEVATOR, Pedro has now made his way up

     to Jake's shoulders. Think chimpanzee. Agness' cell RINGS       
     and as she answers it --


               -- See you in the Big Apple.                          
     Pedro is now resting on Jake's head.                            

                   (trying to be nonchalant                          
                    with a kid on his head,                          
                    smiles)                                          
               See you there.



     Jane and THREE OF HER GIRLFRIENDS are mid-meal. The wine is
     flowing and the women are laughing. TRISHA has happily never
     been married. JOANNE is widowed and DIANE is divorced. They
     are all Jane's age and have been friends forever.


               That is beyond....


                   
               -- When the three of them got in                      
               the elevator... between that and                      
               the staples and the headache for
               six months... it was the most                         
               insane hour of my life.


               -- Jake has lost his mind.


               Oh, I don't know...


               I know. First of all, he was a
               complete prick for cheating on you.


               Well, can't disagree with that.





And then he marries her... a known
lunatic.


She has a big job.


Why do you always say that?


Because she does. She runs the
whole marketing department at KY,
whatever that station's called so
she's not that big of a lunatic.


Janey, come on, he cheats on you
with her, your 20 year marriage
ends then six months later she
leaves Jake for some random guy,
has a baby, leaves that guy,
marries Jake and she's not nuts?


    
Jo, you're so lucky Jerry's dead.


Oh, thanks.


No, I mean, you never have to bump
into him.


That's true.


    
Janey, you want to meet a guy I met
on Match.com that I didn't like?


Gee, what a great offer.   I don't
think so.


He wasn't that awful.


Oooo. Sounding better every minute.




Trisha stops at Jane's seat, refilling Jane's wine glass.


          You know it's not healthy not to
          have sex for...however long it's                     
          been...                                              

          Trust me... I'm not not doing it on
          purpose.


          Okay. I don't know if this is true,                  
          but I read on line about this woman
          who hadn't done it in so long her
          vagina closed up.


          What!!!    Get out of here.

All the Women SCREAM.


          I swear to God. It grew back
          together.


          Wait. Was it ever one piece?


          All I know is, she had to have a
          vaginaplasty.


          Ouch!!!!                                             

          Oh my Goddddddd.

 Jane flops over on the table, laughing, resting her head.     

              (lifts her head, then
               talks as if she's in the
               doctor's office)
          "Dr. Moss, Hi. I have a little
          situation that needs fixing...."


          Bubbee, you want to fix your
          situation? Just date someone.
          Seriously. Anyone.                                   




      As Jane takes that in, we:                                          






      CAMERA BOOMS DOWN ON Park Avenue to find Jane, the Girls and        
      Harley, just out of a Cab. The Bellman is taking their              
      luggage as the Girls spot their brother, LUKE, heading toward
      them.

      Lauren and Gabby run to Luke, hug him, commenting on his            
      hair, his shoes, his jeans, his tan. Jane lights up when she        
      sees her son, hugs him incredibly hard, kisses his cheek,           
      then another tight squeeze.


                Love when we're all in the same
                time zone.



      They all cross THROUGH THE LOBBY toward the RECEPTION DESK.         

                So, what's up Luke?      Did you decide                   
                to have the party?


                Oh, yeah.    Big time.                                    

                What party?


                Are you guys gonna sleep over?


                If you give us your bed and change
                the sheets.

      They arrive at THE RECEPTION DESK.


                You're having a party? When?
                    
                Hi. Adler. Two rooms...hopefully
                next to each other.





          I have an Adler, J. in a Superior
          Suite, Park Avenue view. Oh, I'm             
          sorry, here it is. Adler J -- two
          Standard Doubles. Sorry about                
          that.


          Yeah, we're not the ones in the
          Superior Suite. Have the other               
          Adlers checked in yet? Just
          wondering.


          No, they haven't, ma'am. Not yet.            
          Now I just need a credit card and            
          your signature.

As Jane takes out her credit card...


          -- Mom, is it okay if the girls
          come with me now and help me set
          up?


          And by girls he means the three of
          us.


          Wait. Hold on. Set up what? I have
          reservations for all of us for
          dinner. That's not happening now?


          I don't know. Me and my friends
          are having this huge thing at our
          apartment and the girls said they'd
          help us set up..
              
          We're going to be together all day
          tomorrow.


          -- Mom, it's his last night before
          graduation.


          Okay, okay.    Do you want me to
          help or...





                   
               -- Love your credit card....



     Jane rides the elevator carrying both girls' jackets and
     carry ons as well as her own. Just as the doors are about to
     close, a Good Looking Couple in their early forties gets on.
     As they go up. The Guy has his hand around the woman's
     waist, his fingers fanning her butt. The Couple looks at
     each other, smiling privately. Jane looks away.



     Two double beds. Jane lies on top of one of the beds, fully
     dressed, shoes off, eyes wide open.



     Jane ENTERS the hotel's posh bar/restaurant.                    

                                                            
               Hi. Adler. One.


               Hi. Your table's almost ready Mrs.
               Adler. Would you like to wait at
               the bar?


                   (trying to read upside
                    down reservation list)
               Sure. You don't happen to have
               another Adler coming in, do you?
               Adler for two?


                   
               No... You're our only Adler this
               evening.


                   
               Thanks.


     Jane takes a seat next to Two Hot Younger Women.                





              
          Pinot Noir, please. No, you know                      
          what? I'll have a Tanqueray Martini                   
          very dry with a twist.                                
Jane strums the bar top, checks out the room. It's fun being    
in a big city. Her martini arrives, she takes a sip and         
HEARS something very familiar. Jake's laugh. She looks
across the bar and sees Jake talking to the bartender. He
seems to be alone. Jane waves. Jake notices her and smiles.


          Where's your....??

Jake picks up his drink and carries it to the bar stool next
to Jane.


          Pedro got the stomach flu so I'm
          flying solo.


          Really? Didn't know you knew how
          to be by yourself.


          Any chance you could just go easy
          on me? Just a one night free pass.
              
          You look good, Janey.


          Yeah....                                              

          You do. You always do.   Your
          hair's shorter.                                       

          Longer.                                               

          I like it.

The Host joins them.                                            

          Mrs. Adler, your table's ready.


          Want some company, Mrs. Adler?




     Jane gives Jake a doubtful look.


               -- We both have to eat.
                                             
               When's the last time we ate a meal
               together?


                                                    
               Just the two of us? Alone?      1999.                  

               So, come on. Once every ten years.


     New drinks arrive for Jane and Jake. Physically, they're         
     sitting as close as they've been in a decade.                    

               So...how are things in the
               fertility world?


                   
               I can't believe it took you this
               long to bring that up.


                   
               Sperm issues?


               Apparently. Yes.


               A baby?! Really Jake? So...the
               next time you go to a graduation,
               you'll be what? Fifty-eight plus...
                   


               -- I think the number you're
               looking for is 79.


               Okay.     So. Seriously, how is that
               good?


               Why are we talking about this? I
               thought we were going to have fun.





                Where'd you get that idea?


      and poured. The bar has filled up and Jane and Jake are           
      sitting a little closer together.                                 

                -- Just tell me, how long were you
                seeing him for?


                Oh, please, it was five years ago.


                I know but I always wondered so...


                Little jealous?


                Yes.


                The man's married now.


                I don't care. How long?


                Eight months.


                    
                Long....


                Not long.


      The bar is now crowded. Jane and Jake are finally eating but      
      still drinking. Jake is telling Jane a long story and she         
      can't stop laughing.                                              





      A DJ spins for the after dinner crowd. Couples dance on the       
      dance floor. Jane and Jake both react to the song.                





               This song reminds me of your                          
               birthday party... the one in our                      
               old house...                                          

               -- Oh, yeah. That was such a fun                      
               night.                                                

               So fun. You wore that white halter                    
               dress....                                             

                                                        
               Oh, yeahhhh....                                       
                   (remembering it all, looks                        
                    at Jake with a longing                           
                    for her own past...)                             

               Want to dance?                                        

               -- No...!                                             





     Jake and Jane are dancing...it's familiar yet with the blush
     of the new. Something's going on here. Jake starts singing.
     Jane joins in. This is by far, the loosest we've seen her.
     Of course, it helps that she's drunk. They dance around one
     another without inhibition. A mating dance....


                   
               You're married to someone else...!


               Tell me about it!

     They both laugh then Jake pulls Jane close.                     

                   
               Hey.... I know you.





                   
               And I know you....





     They're in bed and they've done it. They're not even
     entirely undressed. They're spent, sweaty, breathing
     heavily. Jake cups his hand on Jane's vagina, gives it a
     solid pat and hold.


               Home sweet home.


               Oh......God.........

     Jane covers her face.


               That was one crazy ride...thought
               we were going to break the bed.


                   
               -- I'm having an out of body
               experience.


               Totally. You're so great, Janey. I
               forgot how great. Holy shit.


               Please shut up.    I'm so dizzy.


               And the pilates are payin' off by
               the way.

     Jane moans, OPENS THE NIGHT TABLE DRAWER, leans over and
     throws up into it.


               Oh no!

     Jane woozily sits up on her side of the bed, her back to
     Jake. Jake looks over at her.                                      

               You okay?





                                                       
               Look the other way.


               Why?


               `Cause I have to get up.


               Jane...I know what you...


               Look the other way Jake!!!

     As Jake turns away, Jane runs to the bathroom, carrying a
     pillow covering her bare ass. Jake hears her throw up again.
     He winces.



     Jane sits on the floor, by the toilet, looking wiped out.
     Jake gingerly steps into the bathroom, hair a mess, wearing
     boxer shorts and his unbuttoned shirt.


                   
               WHAT is wrong with us?


               What do you mean? This was
               amazing. We just had a great time.


               A great time? This is the dumbest
               thing two people have ever done.                          
                                                        
     Jake sits on the edge of the tub.    This is news to him.


               Really? I don't know.... I haven't                        
               thought it out, but off the top of
               my head I'd say it was smokin' hot                        
               so something about it wasn't so
               dumb.
                   (she stares up at him,
                     sick as a dog)
               And, FYI, I like that you stopped
               getting bikini waxes. You've gone
               native. I was into it.




     Horrified, Jane lets out a yelp on her way to throwing up
     again.



     The NYU Band plays Pomp and Circumstance as the Graduating
     Class of `09 ENTERS THE FIELD in caps and gowns. All the
     families in the bleachers are on their feet, applauding.


     Jane, in sunglasses, is sobbing, taking photos. Next to her
     are Gabby, Harley and Lauren, hooting, clapping and                
     screaming, "There he is!!!" And next in line is Jake manning
     the video camera, wiping away tears.

     ON THE FIELD, Luke spots his gang in the bleachers and gives
     a broad bow.

     The Adlers go crazy, especially Jane, who does a finger
     whistle. Jake looks over at Jane with puppy dog eyes. The
     girls notice, assuming their Dad is emotional over the
     ceremony. Jane feels Jake's glare but won't dare look over
     at him. Gabby nudges her Mom to look over at Dad. Jane             
     turns his way, sees that look in his eyes and starts to bawl.



     The Family celebrates over lunch. Luke is telling a funny
     story about something that happened on stage at graduation.
     Jane is the only one not fully chiming in and laughing. She
     can't seem to move beyond what happened last night.


                   
               You okay?


               Yeah.   Totally.



     Jake slips off his shoe and rubs his foot up Jane's leg and
     under her skirt.



     Jane jumps, quickly turning it into a reaction to Luke's
     story. She gives Jake a private stare that says, "stop or
     I'll kill you."





          I would like to propose a toast to
          your Mother.


              
          To me?


          I've done my part with you guys,
          but Jane... you -- very talented
          you...


          Oh, God...


          Gabby, I'm serious. Jane, you did                
          a magnificent job, as you always
          do...

The Kids look at one another...what's this about?


          When I look at the three of you
          beautiful kids...all grown up, I
          think of all the work your mother
          did, much of it without my help...
              


          Dude...pull it together.


          -- Janey, I take my hat off to you.


          Okay, Jake. Thank you.
          Out of nowhere, sudden
          appreciation. But thank you.
          Really.


          Not totally out of nowhere,
          Jane...if you know what I mean.


              
          Which I don't...but...


          What's he...?





               -- Have no idea. Let's move on,                          
               shall we?                                                
     Jane holds up her droopy left eye.


               I'd like to say something too. For
               real. No offense to the lovely
               Agness or her charming offspring...
                   


               -- Not nice.

     Harley stops laughing.


               I know. I'm sorry. But I just want
               to say I really loved today, just
               being with the original five...
                   
               -- plus Harley, but he's like one
               of us. I don't think we've ever
               done this before... Had a meal
               together. And hung out like
               this...


               You mean other than the first 13
               years of your life.


               I know what's she saying. It's been
               awesome....just for a whole day to
               be just... us.

     They all reflect on that one.



     The Adlers are at the Reception Desk. Jane and Jake are next
     to each other, signing their credit card receipts, the Kids
     chat behind them.


                   
               Something feels right in the
               universe again, doesn't it?

     Jane looks at him but doesn't answer.    She turns to the Kids.





          So who's coming home when?   No
          one's told me the details.

Jake's CELL RINGS. Jane half listens to his conversation.


                 
          Hey.
              
          How's Pedro feeling?

Distracted, Jane focuses on Lauren.


              
          Okay, we're gonna help pack Luke
          up, the three of us leave day after
          tomorrow and Luke's home the end of
          the week.


              (rejoins, finishing his
               call)
          -- I will. Call you when I land.                     
              (slips cell away, not
               missing a beat)
          Janey, what flight are you on?


          I'm on the uh, the four o'clock.                     

          Ah, too bad. I'm on the five                         
          o'clock.


          That's nuts, why don't you try to
          get on the same flight?


          Yeah, I could try.


          It's been...great, but let's not
          ... push it.


          He was just trying to be nice.


          I know. Okay, I've got to hit the

                    line up)

                    pauses, speechless)


                   
               It was really fun.


                   
               It was.

jogging right past his car, listening to her iPod.


          Jane!

She doesn't hear him. Adam backs up next to her. Jane slows
down. Adam lowers the passenger window. She looks in,
doesn't recognize him at first.


          It's Adam...

               front seat)
          Sure...come on in.

Jane GETS INTO THE CAR just in time to hear:


          -- But perhaps the most important
          lesson in going through your
          divorce is to learn to forgive.
          Forgiveness is the key to--

Adam hits the CD KNOB to turn the CD OFF, but instead he
accidentally FAST FORWARDS.


          In spite of your hurt feelings,
          prove to her that you can be a
          mature--

Adam HITS THE KNOB again and this time, turns it OFF, a bit
mortified.


          Just getting a divorce?





               Yeah.
                   
               Two and a half years ago.


               Wooo.


                   
               It's been a process.


               Here's the good news. In two more
               years you'll actually begin to feel
               normal again.


               In two more years I'll begin to
               feel normal? Why am I having
               trouble seeing that as good news?


               Maybe that was just my experience.


               Oh God, I hope so.                                      



     Blue prints are spread on a garden table.   Adam is drawing as    
     Jane watches.                                                     

               -- So if we move this wall back a                       
               bit, that can bring the arch                            
               forward, which is where you really                      
               want it, right?                                         

               Yes, I'd love that.


                   
               Thought so.


               I have an idea... what if we move                       
               my bedroom like six or eight feet                       
               so I can get more of the morning                        
               light?                                                  


                    JANE
              
          Not possible?


          -- Yes, but you'll wake up in the                     
          morning, open your bedroom door and
          fall 12 feet into your kitchen.


          Ahhh! Forgot it was all open up
          there!


          But I get where you're headed.                        
          Let me see what I can do... This                      
          property is so great... Have you                      
          lived here a long time?


          About ten years. I bought this                        
          place right after my divorce but                      
          it's taken me until now to be able                    
          to finally do this....                                
Jane and Adam are distracted when a Porsche noisily pulls up    
and Jake gets out wearing a suit and a chipper attitude.


          Good morning!
              
          Am I interrupting...?


              
          Hi. No, well, we   were just about                    
          done. Adam, this   is my ex-husband,                  
          Jake. Jake, this   is Adam Schaeffer,                 
          my architect.


          Hi.


              
          Good to meet you.


              
          Can I take a look?   Do you mind?

Adam looks to Jane for approval but too late, Jake's already
looking.





               Everything's not 100% worked out
               yet...


               Wow. You're finally getting the
               kitchen you always wanted...                             

               Yeah...


               Huge bedroom.                                            

               It's not huge.                                           
                   
               Why don't I show these to you when
               we get a little closer.

     Jane starts to roll up the blueprints, fumbles a little.
     Adam finishes for her. She thanks him with her eyes.


               So, I think next we should stake
               out the addition... see how it all                       
               feels - size wise...                                     

               Sounds great.                                            

               I'll e-mail you and we'll set it                         
               up. We did good work today. Jake,                        
               nice meeting you.

     Jake smiles and waves as Adam exits, walking to his car.           

                   
               Got time for a cup of coffee?

     Adam can't help but sneak a look back at them.   Jane waves, a     
     bit embarrassed.



     Jane moves nervously around the kitchen, opening the fridge,
     taking out juice...





          Why haven't you returned any of my
          calls or e-mails?


          Jake, come on. This is just too
          weird. We have to just never do
          what we did - ever again. You're            
          an adulterer and I'm an awful
          person, basically. I haven't slept
          in days. What we did was just so
          wrong on so many levels.


          And it was so right on a couple of
          levels too. Admit it.


              
          No! It wasn't! On no levels was
          it right!


          You can't say we didn't enjoy each
          other's company. Sitting at the
          bar, dancing...after dancing...
              (she doesn't want to be
               reminded)
          Come on, you and I haven't had fun
          like that in a hundred years.               

          Yes! Because we're not supposed to
          have fun like that! We're
          divorced!   Are you like, what?
          Unhappy at home?   Does she not
          "understand" you? Did you just              
          want to know what it would be like
          with someone my age? What is this?


          I'd be lying if I said I never
          think about you, Janey. I think
          about you. A lot. And no, it's not
          perfect at home. Obviously. Look
          at me. I've got three grown kids
          and I'm going to kindergarten
          interviews. I'm a walking cliche.

Jane shrugs.   She agrees.





And I can't, literally can't stop
thinking about what happened in New
York. Fate brought us together
once, maybe it happened again.
    
And I know... you've moved on with           
your life, I get it, but you can't
deny something real and honest
happened that night. Can't we just
go with it, see where it takes us.
No one has to know.
    
You were so great. So loose and
sexy. How often do you get to be
like that?    You can run and open
restaurants and build your perfect
kitchen but what about having
someone to hold you in the middle
of the night...?


Not high on my list these days.


But what if that someone is someone
who's known you since you're 23 and
loved you for most of your life.


I forgot what a good lawyer you
are.


Give this a shot, Janey.... Life is          
short and it's tough. Don't
discount what we have with each
other.
    
You know what they say... people in
nursing homes who have plants live
longer than the people without
plants.


Oh, so you're saying you think this          
is a healthy choice for me?


Honey, I know it is.






     And the plants get watered.



     Jane and Jake have done it again. In broad daylight and
     sober. They catch their breath.


               Oh, God, it's official.    We're
               having an affair.


               Why do you need to label                                
               everything?


               Because that's what this is.


               Yes, in its crassest form, maybe,
               if we were two other people.


               Just because we were married for 19
               years does not not make this an
               affair.


               Okay, but since we were together
               for so long, it's not really that
               wrong.


               Really? You want to run that logic
               by your wife?

     Jane fans herself.



               Do me a favor, you're on my side.
               Can we switch? I feel disoriented.


               Since when is this your side?


               Since ten years ago.   Please...                        




They switch sides. In the middle of this maneuver Jake lands
on top of Jane. He pauses.


          Could I interest you in a little...


          No!                                                       
They flop onto the opposite sides of the bed.    Jane fans
herself. So hot.                                                    

              
          Why do you think the sex is so much
          sexier this time?


          I don't know.

Jane pulls the sheet up.   They look at one another. He gets        
her to smile.                                                       

          I've gotta get to work.


          Me too. Okay...
              (moans as he sits up, then                            
               rises)

Jake starts to get dressed. Jane watches him from bed,
checking out his stomach. He notices.


              
          See what happens when you're not
          looking out for me.
              
          She lets me eat everything.. pasta,
          cream cheese...


          Can you hand me my robe?

Jake reaches for Jane's robe, hands it to her.   She indicates
Jake should turn around.


          Why do I have to..?





          -- Because the last time you saw me
          standing up naked I was in my
          forties.
              
          Things look different lying down.
          Just...

Jake rolls his eyes, turning away from her.


          You've gotten a little nuts.


              
          Jake, I think it would be really
          good for us to not talk for a few
          days. Okay?                                  

              
          You know what I think -- just for
          the record? I think we're doing
          something kinda brilliant. All the
          things that tore us apart aren't
          issues anymore. I'd say our
          problems actually went away.


          What..?                                      

          Didn't you always say you felt you
          weren't being heard? Wasn't that
          our big issue -- both of us always
          feeling rejected and unappreciated.
          Look at us now. You're so much
          more together, you're not exhausted
          all the time, you're not catering
          every weekend and busy all day with
          the kids and I'm calmer, less
          obsessed about work. I'm a partner.
          I'm there. We grew into the people           
          we wanted each other to be! And I            
          don't know... I appreciate things
          about you I couldn't even see
          before.


              (not wanting to get into
               it)
          Really?


                         JANE
               Well, you know, I'm not as good as
               you at remembering all the details
               of our...


                   
               -- Do you remember never having
               time for sex? Now look at us.
               We've already done it two times
               this week and it's only Tuesday. I
               swear to God, if half the couples
               who got divorced, could get back
               together 10 years later, their
               problems would be solved. I think
               we're on to something.


               Not sure I agree and...also, we're
               not back together.                                    

               And I know other divorced people
               think about this...they wonder -
               what if....
                   
               I think this is very French of us.


               How is this French of us?


               I have a young wife but I'm having
               sex with my old wife. Not old, you
               know. Ex!
                   
               I didn't mean old...

39   Jane tosses Jake his jacket. They EXIT the BEDROOM and head

     toward THE FRONT DOOR.


               You're doing that thing where you
               act like you're not listening...
               but think about what I'm saying,
               okay?
                   
               Do you have any of your homemade
               granola here? I haven't had it in
               so long.


               You miss it?





               So much.


               We sell it for $6.50 a bag at the
               store.


               Yeah, why give it away when you
               can...
                   (Jane OPENS the front door
                    and moves him outside)
               Kiss good bye?

     Jane kisses him on the cheek.


               She wants to be courted!
                   
               I can do that!

                    fingers)
               -- Coffee....

     Jane can't close the door fast enough.



     Jane carries three beautiful homemade pies, arriving in THE     
     LIVING ROOM where her Friends are gathered. Platters of food
     and open bottles of wine are on the coffee table.


               Oh my God, now what?   Three pies?!                   
               This is a feast!


               I don't know what's going on, I
               have so much energy lately which I
               think is probably a result of...
               all the sex I'm having.
                   
               Yeah. I'm actually not kidding.
               I'm having an affair.
                   
               With a married man.





          What? When did this happen?
          Where'd you meet him?


          Well, it... started in New York.


          In New York??? Last week?


          Yeah, we did it once there and once
          here. Maybe more than once there,
          I was drunk so...


          You had drunken sex with a married
          man in New York when you went for
          Luke's graduation?


              
          Turns out I'm a bit of a slut.
              
          Apple, Blueberry or Plum?                    

          Wait, wait, wait. Hold on....                
          You're not saying!!!!


              
          -- What?


              
          No! You're not!


          Oh, God, but I am. I'm having an
          affair with Agness Adler's husband.

The Women all SCREAM as Jane fans herself.


          That. Is. Genius!


          But also sort of wrong.


          I know.





Oh, please. Not that wrong.


I know! I'm so happy to be able to
tell someone. This is the most out           
of control thing I've ever done.             
Literally. You know me.


Yes we do. You don't do anything
wrong, or bad. Ever. So you're               
allowed this one. I'm sorry ... I
kinda love it.


He was yours first.


True. Not that I want him back by
the way.


Of course not. You can do better
than Jake.


    
Thanks.


I mean you've outgrown him. You've
blossomed, you feng shuied your
whole life... Just please, don't
let him talk you into saving him.


I won't...
    


There is something kinda perfect
about this. You don't have to cook
for him or clean up after him or
actually even sleep with him....


Yeah, I have an Ex with benefits...          





               But, girls, what about the fact
               that I'm now the other woman? I'm
               the one we hate.


               Oh, forget that.    Agness is still                    
               the one we hate.    Even in this
               scenario.


               Yeah, karma is the ultimate bitch
               on this one.



     Jane walks through the busy kitchen holding a sheet of paper.
     Her shirt is a little more fitted. Her make up, a little
     prettier. She crosses to the head Baker who's just taking a
     tray of cookies out of the oven.                                 

               Reynaldo, I'm changing the
               breakfast menu, want to give it a
               little more life...
                   (shows it to him, he seems                         
                    distracted)                                       
               What do you think?


                                                          
               -- What'd you do? Something to
               your hair?


               I don't think so.


               Something about you looks
               different. Little more "caliente."                     

               Caliente?

     Another Chef in the kitchen nods in agreement.


               You see it Eddie?


               Whatever it is, it's workin'.




     He winks at Jane as he stirs cookie batter.    Jane blushes as
     her cell phone rings.


               Hello.
                   
               No! I didn't do this again!



     CAMERA MOVES IN on Adam, waiting by a ladder in the middle of
     the field. Jane's addition is staked out with orange tape.        


     Rushing toward Adam.


               Adam, I'm so sorry.   My mind is
               just... Forgive me.


               If I were your shrink I'd say maybe
               you don't really want to build this
               house.


               That's completely not true.   I'm
               really sorry.
                   (looks at taped off
                    addition)                                          
               Oh! I like it already!                                  

               Yeah, it's feeling really good. So,                     
               this becomes your office. We come                       
               down your new hallway, the windows                      
               are all along here...                                   

               Great. Love it.                                         

               And from here to there...wait, let                      
               me get the door for you...                              
                                                
               Your kitchen.                                           
                                                           
               We're in the eating area. How's                         
               the size?
                   
               We're at either end of the table.





                                                       
               Feels perfect.


               I thought so too.                                       

                                                     
               This is heaven!                                         

               It's gonna be cool.    Want to go                       
               upstairs?                                               




               So if you were lying in bed, this
               would be your view.

     Jane breaks into a smile.




     Over this tranquil view -- A CELL RINGS. Jane takes her
     phone out of her pocket, sees it's Jake calling. She pauses,
     then pushes "IGNORE" and then promptly loses her balance.
     Adam immediately reaches over and steadies her.


               You okay?


                   
               Yeah.







     Water is running in the sink, even though no one's at the
     sink. Jake is in the shower stall, fully dressed, putting
     away his cell. He quietly pushes the shower door open and
     then carefully shuts it with a small snap. Jake fake coughs
     and then turns off the sink water. He checks his watch when
     he hears GLASS BREAKING in another room then hears Agness
     calling his name in anger. He leaps.





          Coming!

Jake quietly UNLOCKS THE BATHROOM DOOR and EXITS to find his
path is blocked by Pedro who sits on a tricycle staring up at
him.


          What were you doing in there?


          Going to the bathroom.


          The toilet didn't flush.


          Yes it did.


          Why were you in the shower with
          your clothes on?


              (making sure Agness
               doesn't hear)
          What are you talking about?


          I heard the shower door close.


          What do you have, x-ray ears?

Agness joins in briefs and a white tank, black bra peeking
through. She holds a broom.


          What's up Pedro?


          Jake took a shower with his clothes
          on.


          Pedro!    Darling...                                   

          What's he talking about?


          I don't speak Pedro.   That's your
          department.





                   
               Don't go in the kitchen, P, I broke
               something.
                   
               Yo. Can you help?

     Agness EXITS back to the kitchen as Pedro stares at Jake.





     These open-faced fancy French Grilled Cheese Sandwiches are
     carried to Jane's counter. We're:



     Jane very professionally places the Croque-Monsieurs onto two
     waiting plates, adds some salad on the side. Adam stands
     nearby with a glass of wine, jacket off.                          

               That looks amazing.


               It's called a croque-monsieur. It's
               one of the first things I learned
               to make when I lived in Paris
               because the ingredients are really
               really cheap.


               When did you live in Paris?


               In my early twenties. I went there
               to take a six day pastry class and
               ended up staying a year working as
               an apprentice in a bakery.                              
     Jane places the plates AT THE ISLAND as she and Adam SIT SIDE
     BY SIDE. Jane raises her wine glass.                              

               Thank you for taking my 47 e-mails                      
               and turning them into something so                      
               beautiful.                                              





               You are rapidly becoming one of the                   
               most appreciative clients I've ever                   
               had...                                                

               Well, I'm not all that used to                        
               being able to count on anyone...                      

                   
               Really?                                               



     He squints, looking ahead, SEES:



     And Adam's car parked out front. Jake turns OFF HIS
     HEADLIGHTS, slowly pulling around to the side of the house.




               I know it's none of my business
               but... I'm trying to figure out why
               someone like you is divorced.


               And what'd you come up with?


               Something in the you're too nice
               department..?


               Yes, that and my wife fell in love
               with my best friend. Ex-best                          
               friend.                                               

               Oh, no!


               We were all on a biking trip, he                      
               and his wife, me and my
               wife...through Tuscany and on the
               last day of the trip they announced
               they were in love.





               That's awful.


               Yeah.   Not a great plane ride home.


               I can imagine, sitting there for
               eleven hours with your wife who you
               know is -- oh, that's rough.


               Actually they went on to Venice and
               I flew back with Carol, his wife.
               You can't imagine what it's like to                     
               sit next to someone who's been                          
               crying for ten straight hours.                          

               I don't blame her.


               I was talking about me. Anyway,
               they're married now and it's
               pretty much an ongoing awful thing.
               But, you and your ex... When I saw
               him stop by for a cup of coffee the
               other morning, I thought -- Wow!                        
               That's the way it's supposed to be.                     
               You two seem to have it all figured
               out.


               We're not as figured out as you'd
               think.



     Jake, in work-out clothes, sprints across the front lawn,         
     careful not to be seen.                                           


     Jane clears their dishes.


                   
               You know I hope you don't feel I've
               been interrogating you, but...


                    JANE
          I know what it's like to have your
          ex remarried and to not have so
          much going on in that department.
          I mean, do you date ever or...                           

          Uh, constantly actually.


          Constantly?


          Everyone I know or have ever known
          has fixed me up. And then,
          sometimes I just meet women, I
          don't know how that happens, but...


          -- But no girlfriend?


          Not yet.

Jane stands ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ISLAND and hands Adam
another croque-monsieur. She stays on her side, like a
waitress at a counter. She refills his water glass.


          Just like to date...


          Actually, I find it really
          stressful. You know, the last time
          I was in the dating world was 1978.                      
          It's a little more complicated
          these days. I can't tell you how                         
          nice it is to have a conversation                        
          with a woman and have the pressure
          off. Not to mention, a home cooked
          meal that no one else I know could
          possibly cook.

Jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that.   She
smiles, wiping the counter.


          That was a compliment. So you                            
          don't have a guy in your life at
          the moment?


          No....
              
          No.





               No?





     Jake rises from the bushes outside of Jane's Kitchen Window.        
     He PEEKS in the window, balancing himself precariously on a         
     stack of loose bricks. He sees Jane telling Adam a story and        
     both of them cracking up. Jake leans in further to try to           
     hear what Jane's saying when the bricks slip under his feet,        
     he loses his balance and drops OUT OF THE FRAME.                    



     Jane walks Adam to the door.    He holds rolled blueprints.


               This was so nice and relaxing and
               the lavender ice cream was actually
               the best dessert of any sort I've
               ever had... like, in my life.


               Aw, thank you. I always make ice
               cream when I can't sleep, so I'm
               glad someone was here to eat it.
                   


                                                              
               Great getting to know you a little.


                   
               It was really fun.

     Adam waves, Jane waves. Definitely a little sweet/awkward.          
     Jane closes her door, starts turning out lights, heading for
     the kitchen, when there's a QUICK KNOCK on the FRONT DOOR.


               Woops!   Coming!

     Jane quickly returns to the door and opens it to find:



     leaning in the door frame.





          O.M.G. I thought he'd never leave.
              
          Hello Jane, you look very beautiful
          tonight.

He takes her in his arms.


          Mmmmm. Love when you smell like
          butter.


              
          What are you doing here?


          Missed you.


          It's nine o'clock. Where does your
          wife think you are?


          At yoga.   Shall we do some
          downward facing dog?


          Not tonight big guy.

They CROSS INTO THE KITCHEN. CAMERA TRACKS.


          Is it really necessary for you to
          always say no before you say yes? I
          won't think less of you, you know.


          Really, Jake, I'm a little tired, I
          was just gonna take a bath.


          Good. So, we'll just hang out.
              (now IN THE KITCHEN, he
               SEES the dinner dishes on
               the counter)
          Ooooo, is that Croque-Monsieur?
          Who's plate is this? Yours or his?


          Mine.





                   (eats her leftovers,
                    savors the taste)
               Oh my God, just as I remember it.


               Don't you ever eat at your house?


               Pedro dictates all meals and he has
               a very limited palate.
                   
               What kind of ice cream is that?


               Lavender Honey.


                                                         
               Not sleeping?


               Not at all. You?


               Never slept better. And my                             
               digestion is finally back on track.
               You've turned my world right side
               up, Jane. You know what this
               means, don't you?


               No...


               That I've never really known how to
               live without you.



     Jane takes a bubble bath. Jake lies on the floor, leaning
     against the tub, his back to her, eating a bowl of ice cream.


               Maybe we should be growing old
               together.


               Hate to tell you, big guy, but we
               already grew old apart.





          What's with the `big guy'? Is that
          because you think I'm fat or is it
          a term of endearment?                        

          I have no idea why I keep saying
          that. I'm sorry. I'll stop.


          Thank you.
              
          I love how quiet it is in your
          house. I have no quiet in my life.
          Ever.


          Yeah, well, you live with a five             
          year old.


          Yes...and don't forget Pedro.

Jane splashes him.


          So what does that mean exactly...?           
          What's going on over there at your
          place?


          My marriage is... not turning out
          as I hoped. That's obvious....
          Agness started out really looking
          up to me... We never used to fight
          but now... with the kid....lately
          we're all about where he's gonna go
          to school and now she says we need           
          a bigger house, more help. I was
          thinking of cutting back at work...          
          now that's never gonna happen. And           
          she wants another baby before Pedro
          gets too old which I get but since
          we're always fighting... oh, God,
          listen to me.


          Isn't a baby part of the deal when
          you marry a woman that age?





          Is it? I guess so. She's got me
          booked at the fertility center
          every other day and she's so amped
          up on hormone injections I may need
          to find an exorcist if she doesn't
          calm down.                                            
               
          I wish it was funny.
               
          Incredible ice cream. I'm turning
          around...
               (as he turns, Jane shrinks
                in the tub)
          Remember when we used to smoke pot
          and eat your ice cream in the hot
          tub?


          The "hot tub"... That feels like a
          billion years ago.


          How long has it been since you...                     
              (indicates smoking a                              
               joint)                                           

          Me?   Since before Lauren was born.


          27 years?!!


          At least.

Jake slips a joint out of his shirt pocket, twirls it.          

          Are you kidding me? Put that away!                    
          It's been too long...


          Exactly.


          I'm not going to....                                  

          Okay, why don't I leave this with                     
          you...                         
          Maybe you'll take a few hits...


                            JAKE
                  get your sea legs, then we'll smoke
                  the rest of it together.


                  Maybe....

     Jake places the joint in a drawer.


                  So that nerdy architect likes
                  you...you know that, right?


                  He's not nerdy and he definitely
                  doesn't. We're working together.


                  I was watching when you bent down
                  to open the oven, his eyes were
                  glued to your ass.


                                                 
                  Hey, will you do me a favor?



     Jake is on a small ladder, changing a light bulb in the
     chandelier. Jane, in a robe, stands beneath him.                  


                      (looking down at her,
                       smiles)
                  Tell the truth, Janey is this a
                  great affair, or what?


                  I don't know. It's my first.


                      
                  We don't even have to have sex and
                  it's fun.
                      
                  I wish I could sleep over.


                  I gotta tell my shrink about this.
                  This is a lot to handle. I guess
                  you should go ... I'm sure yoga's
                  probably closed by now.


                    JANE
          Oh, you got a little ice cream on
          your shirt. Let me get that out.


          It's okay...

Jake takes Jane in his arms and gives her a deep hug. He
lingers, kissing her neck, smelling her skin. She kisses him
on the cheek. He slides her robe off her shoulder. He
softly caresses her shoulder, kissing it, then makes his way
up her neck.   Jane gives in and kisses Jake fully on the
lips. He pulls her close, her robe falling.


          Wow, wow, wow...what's happening,
          Jake?

The Phone RINGS.   Jane pauses.                                 

          Don't get it.                                         

          I always get it. I have three
          kids.
              (Jake wishes she wouldn't.
                She hesitates, picks it
                up)
          Hello. Hiii...
              (makes an I told you so
                face)
          You still on the plane? How was
          Luke when you left? Oh, that                          
          sounds like fun. Let me know what
          I can bring..... No! Don't have                       
          any idea where he is.
              
          Okay, honey, talk to you tomorrow.
              
          Now I'm lying...... Lauren and                        
          Harley are giving Luke a graduation
          party this weekend. Sweet, huh?

Jake's CELL PHONE RINGS, sees it's Lauren calling.


              
          Hello stranger. Welcome back.

Jane OPENS THE DOOR and Jake darts over for a quick kiss and
then EXITS toward his car. They wave to one another.





                   
               -- Just getting in my car. This                        
               weekend? Sounds great. Let me
               know what I can bring...

     Jake looks to Jane. She shakes her head -- he's shameless.
     Jake shrugs. Jane watches as Jake drives off, talking on his
     cell.



     Jane paces outside of a medical building, holding a box from
     her bakery.   She's clearly waiting for someone.

     She spots a comfortably dressed MAN IN HIS MID FORTIES           
     holding the leash of an Airedale and approaching the             
     building's entrance.


                   
               Dr. Allen!


                   
               Jane. Hi. Am I seeing you today?                       

               No, I just need to talk...and I was                    
               wondering if there was any chance
               you could squeeze me in for an
               emergency session. I'm sort of
               desperate for some advice. I
               brought you some of that coffee
               cake you like. Not as a bribe or
               anything...


                   
               I only have twenty minutes until my
               first patient.


               That's fine. I'll talk fast.                           



     Jane, Dr. Allen and the Dog walk the corridor.                   





                    
                So, at this point, I just need some                   
                sound, unbiased guidance. Is                          
                having an affair with you know who
                a good thing or a bad thing?
                    (they stop at Dr. Allen's
                     office door)
                It's a bad thing, right? How could
                it be good?


                    
                It's not good. It's not bad.

     Oh, man.   Not what she needs to hear.                           


     Jane sits in a chair across from an empty chair.   Dr. Allen
     turns on a few lamps as his dog settles.                         

                You know, things happen in life and                   
                our job is to find out why. What                      
                we have to do is take a real look
                at this. Are you ready to do that?


                I am. Definitely. I've made a list                    
                of what this can possibly be
                about...at my end. Can I read it
                to you?


                                                     
                Of course.                                            

                    (digging out her                                  
                     Blackberry)                                      
                Thanks. I e-mailed it to myself.                      
                    
                Okay. Am I still trying to figure
                out why the marriage failed? Do I
                want to get back together? Do we
                have unfinished business? Is this                     
                about revenge?   Am I just...                         
                lonely? Or, is it my "caretaker"                      
                thing?


                    JANE
          You know, the kids are finally gone                
          and now all of a sudden Jake's back
          and I get to take care of him in
          some way...

Dr. Allen nods, impressed with the work she's done.          

          And, listen, I get how therapy                     
          works, I do... We look at things,                  
          we examine them, weeks turn into
          months, what....? we're going on                   
          eight years, right?.... and I'm                    
          okay with that, I like it... but in
          this case, I need to know what you
          really think. Like, I'd like you                   
          to say... Don't do this, it's
          absolutely wrong or go ahead,
          you'll be fine. I actually want to
          be told what to do.


          What's interesting is I'm already
          seeing you open up more than I have
          in some time. I'm thinking,                        
          through this affair, you may learn                 
          to view the world in a different
          way.


          I'm sorry. I need more concrete.
          Are you saying I should keep seeing
          him? Because, honestly, if the                     
          guilt and fear could go away, maybe
          I could let go a little and figure                 
          this out.


          I wouldn't resist looking at this.


                                    
          Okay... and another way of saying                  
          that is....?


          Let go Jane. It can't hurt.                        
Jane fist pumps in the air.






     Jake is in the Waiting Room with several other "Older" Men
     all with their much younger Wives.   A Nurse ENTERS, holding       
     a chart.


               Jacob Adler?                                             
     Jake rises.   One of the younger women whispers...


               Have fun...                                              



     The Nurse shows Jake into a windowless room with a sink, a
     pleather barcalounger, a TV and a DVD player.


               Okay, you know the drill. You can
               hang your things in the closest,
               the remote is on top of the TV and
               the materials are in the drawers.
                   (cleaning the remote with
                     an anti-bacterial wipe)
               Please deposit your specimen in the
               cup and I'll see you when you're
               done.

     She dims the light before leaving.

     Jake takes off his jacket, tosses it on the chair, slips off
     his shoes, takes off his pants, sits for a sec when his PHONE
     RINGS. He looks at the name of the caller. Smiles.


               Hi.




                   
               Hey, where are you?


               At the office.


               Want to grab some lunch?





               Absolutely. When?


               Can you do it now? I have about an
               hour. Thought we could go to The                       
               Stanhope....get room service.                          
                   (she's nervous just saying
                    it)


                   
               Be there in ten!


               See you there, Adler.


                                                            
               She's comin' back!

     Jake rushes to put on his pants, catches his foot in the
     pant's hem, hops to safety. He reaches for his jacket then
     grabs an anti-bacterial wipe, using it to turn the door knob.



     Harley and Lauren are having lunch in the CAFE connected to
     the Lobby. Harley has a clear view of the Lobby's Reception
     Desk. Lauren has her back to it.


               -- Luke's so excited about his
               party. We can fit forty people in
               our place, can't we?


               Sure, if nobody wants to sit                           
               down...                                                
                   (notices JAKE ENTERING the
                    hotel)
               -- Hey, there's your...

     Harley then realizes JAKE IS signing the Register and            
     CHECKING IN and chokes on his French Fry.


               My what...
                   

     Harley grabs Lauren's face in his hands and kisses her, even
     though he's choking. He coughs while kissing her.





          Harley!!!


          I'm sorry, I didn't mean to spit on
          you. I just needed to kiss you.


          While you were choking?


          It worked.     I'm not choking
          anymore.

Harley swallows a cough, reaching for his water, HIS EYES ON
JAKE as Jake is HANDED A ROOM KEY and POINTED TOWARD THE
ELEVATOR. Harley drinks his entire glass of water as he
watches.


              
          Who did you just see?

Luckily Jake is now gone.


          No one. Thought it was your
          cousin...but...

Harley falls silent as he SEES JANE ENTER THE HOTEL AND CROSS
TO THE RECEPTION DESK. After a sec, she's pointed toward the
same elevator.                                                   

          Ohhhh my sweet Lord....


              
          Now what?


          Honey, I totally forgot I have a
          conference call at 1:15, I gotta
          get back to the office. Waiter!
          Honey, stop eating, get the waiter.
          Call the one over there.
              (pointing her away from
               Jane)


          Harley, we can't leave, we're
          meeting with the Wedding
          Specialist.





                   (watches as Jake waits for
                    Jane around the corner)                            
               Yeah, you know what? Today's not a
               good idea to do that.                                   
                   (Sees Jane join Jake, they                          
                    step into the elevator                             
                    and immediately fall into                          
                    each other's arms and                              
                    kiss)                                              
               Oh my God...!!!                                         



     The curtains are drawn,   the lights are low. Jane, in a hotel
     robe, slips a cd in the   cd player and we hear a mellow song,
     perfect for love in the   afternoon. The Bathroom Door OPENS
     and Jake EXITS, also in   a hotel robe.

     Jane stands across the room from him. They smile at one
     another. From behind, we see Jane untie her robe, letting it
     fall to the floor. Jake looks at her, from head to toe and
     back. They smile at one another, then something comes over
     Jake. His eyes roll back, his legs give out and he collapses
     against the wall.


               Jake!!!                                                 



     The Hotel's Wedding Specialist has joined Lauren and Harley's
     table. She holds a binder filled with photos. Harley is a
     mess, knowing what's going on upstairs.


               I adore October weddings. Let me
               show you what we did last October.

     She opens her Book of Photos for Lauren. Lauren gasps.


                   
               Honey, I'm gonna make that phone
               call from the...

     Lauren and the Wedding Specialist don't look up and don't
     hear him. They keep talking to each other.





                   
               -- Okay. Good. You just keep doing
               that and I'll...                                      
     They still don't look up. Harley nervously HEADS FOR THE        
     LOBBY when he spots the HOTEL DOCTOR, bag in hand, arriving
     at the Reception Desk.


               What's the room number?


               408. Adler. His wife said he's                        
               conscious now...


                   
               On my way.

     Harley stops in his tracks, freaking.   Adler???



     Jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure cuff
     around his arm. Jane, still in her robe, paces. The Hotel
     Doc sits on a chair next to Jake's side of the bed.


               Your blood pressure's good.


               How's his heart?


               Do you have a heart condition, Mr.
               Adler?


               No.   And I just had a check up.


               You did?   Oh, that's good.


                   
               Deep breath. So, no chest pain?


               None.





          When you got dizzy, did you feel
          your heart was beating funny?


          Yes, but I was admiring my
          beautiful...
              

Jane holds up her weak eyelid.


          -- Well that's nice to hear after
          all these years...
              
          Did you forget to take any of your
          medications today?


          Took `em all.


          What all did you take?                      

          Uh....Lipitor, baby aspirin..               
              
          Flomax.


              
          Flomax?


               
          Yes, otherwise I pee 40 times a
          day.


          How long have you been taking the           
          Flomax?


          Not that long. And I only take it
          sporadically. I have to sneak it
          actually.
              
          It reduces semen and that's not
          good for my wife right now.
              
          Sorry.





                      
                  Really..?


                  Yes, I prefer a lot of semen.
                  Always have.
                      
                  Okay, well, thank you so much for                   
                  coming. Looks like he's gonna live,
                  so...


                      
                  Yeah, my guess is Flomax is
                  probably the culprit here. It can
                  definitely give you a sudden drop
                  in blood pressure so I suggest you
                  stay off it for a few weeks, which
                  apparently your wife will
                  appreciate.
                      


                  Yeah.   Really good for me.

     The Doctor snaps his bag shut, rises.


                  And I suggest you rest quietly for
                  the rest of the afternoon.
                      
                  No hanky panky, Mrs. Adler.


                  No chance. I assure you.



     Harley sits on a bench with his head between his legs. Lauren
     arrives, joins him on the bench.


                  Are you acting like this because of
                  the wedding? Tell me the truth?


                      
                  Not at all. Swear to God.





               Because I don't want to be one of
               those couples where the guy goes
               into a coma the whole time we plan
               the wedding. It's not worth it to
               me.

     Harley looks up, sees the Hotel Doc walk by the Reception
     Clerk. The Doc gives her a wink and a "thumbs up" and keeps
     on walking.


                   
               Okay! We're back in business!



     In Jane and Jake's room.



     Sitting up in bed, in their robes, watching Oprah and eating
     chicken soup on trays. Jake reaches for the salt. Jane
     eases it away from him. Jake looks over at Jane, oozing with
     love and appreciation.


               See. Just that move...you have no                     
               idea. Not everyone's like that...


                   
               Jake, I have a confession to make.                    
               Back when we broke up... I knew it
               wasn't all your fault.


               You mean that?   You've never said
               that to me before.                                    

               I know. Because when you cheated,                     
               I didn't have to. But I think in
               some way, I gave up on us and I'm
               not sure you ever really did.


               I still haven't.


     Jake takes Jane's hand. She looks down at his wedding ring,
     then turns her eyes back to Oprah. A beat, then:





               Are you and Agness... still having
               sex?

     Jake doesn't answer.    Jane turns, looks right at him.


               Only if she initiates it.

     Jane GROANS.                                                      

               I'm trying not to rock the boat at
               home until you and I figure this
               out.
                    
               This is a little trickier at my end
               than yours.


               Right. Yeah. Okay....                                   
                   
               Now I know you're gonna think I'm                       
               leaving because of what you just                        
               said, but I'm not. I really have
               to get back to work.


                   
               We got really close there for a
               moment.

     She knows he's right. Jane's Cell RINGS.     She lets it ring
     again, then answers it.


                   
               Hello?



                   
               Hi, hope I'm not interrupting
               anything.




               Adam! Oh!     Hi.




     Jake is instantly jealous.   He rises, crosses to the closet,
     starts dressing, his eyes glued to Jane who seems to be very
     engaged by Adam.


               I just found out there's a French
               Film Festival in town and that made
               me think of you so I was wondering
               if you'd like to go to the opening
               night tomorrow night.
                   (a little nervous... will
                    she accept?)


               Oh, that sounds so fun...
                   
               Let me think, tomorrow's what?


                   
               -- Say you're busy. Agness has a
               dinner thing tomorrow, I can come
               over.
                   
               Please.


               Oh, um, you know, I'd really love
               to, but, my son is coming home from
               college the next day and I have a
               bunch of things I have to do to get
               ready...
                   (hates lying, Jake crosses
                    to her, smiles)
               I'm so sorry.


               No, don't worry. No problem. Maybe
               we can see something another night.


               Absolutely. I would love that.                         
     Jake smiles appreciatively, crosses to Jane, hugs her.           



     We see he is holding Two Movie Tickets. He looks at them
     then crosses to the desk of a Female Worker.





               Melanie, how would you and your
               husband like two tickets to the
               opening of the French Film
               Festival? Reserved seats...VIP
               parking...


               Seriously?



     Jane and Jake are finishing getting dressed, moving about,
     putting on shoes, blouses, ties, jackets, belts...                 

               You'll make the whole thing?    The
               roast chicken, the---


               -- mashed potatoes, sauteed string
               beans and double fudge chocolate                         
               cake. I know your favorite dinner,
               Jakey.


                   
               You haven't called me Jakey in 10
               years. This has been a great day
               for us. So, do we have a date?                           

                   
               We have a date.                                          
     Jake grabs his heart. Jane leans on him, a smile on her face       
     as we begin to HEAR MUSIC.                                         



     Music plays from the outdoor speakers. Jane sets the table in      
     her courtyard. She's singing along with the music.                 


     sits on the Kitchen Counter. Jane finishes off icing the
     cake like the pro she is then peeks into the oven, looks at        
     her perfect roast chicken.                                         








     Jane clips the price tag off of a new dress and slips it off       
     its hanger.



     tells us it's 8:45.



     His eyes glued to the clock. We are IN JAKE AND AGNESS'
     BEDROOM. Jake and Agness lie on their bed, both doing paper
     work. Pedro is asleep between them. Jake gets up, slipping         
     his cell into his hand.                                            

                   
               Why are you taking your cell to the
               bathroom?


               Oh. Didn't mean to.
                   (places it back on the
                    night stand)


               Carry him to his bed, will you?

     Jake carefully lifts Pedro off the bed.


                   
               And hurry back. I'm ovulating.


               You are?


               Why do you think I cancelled my
               dinner?

     Agness pulls her t-shirt over her head... she is gorgeous.



     Jake gently lies Pedro in his bed, pulls up the covers. Pedro
     takes Jake's hand, holds it to his chest, looking up at him.       
     Jake offers a comforting smile and Pedro closes his eyes.



     Jake sits on the bed and lets Pedro fall back asleep, holding
     onto his hand.                                                   



     Candles are lit on the table, but are now low. The table is      
     set with flowers from the garden. The wine has not been          
     opened. CAMERA CRANES to FIND Jane INSIDE THE KITCHEN, still
     dressed for dinner and deep in thought. She then sighs very      
     deeply and decisively as she turns out the lights and room by
     room, the house becomes dark.



     The Kids cars are in the driveway.



     Jane, Gabby, Lauren and Harley are in the kitchen, cooking,      
     setting the table, opening wine, chatting.


               -- Oh, Mom, I keep forgetting to                       
               tell you about our meeting at The                      
               Stanhope. We went there for lunch                      
               two days ago and met with their                        
               Wedding Specialist....I think that                     
               could be the place, Mom....                            

               Two days ago you went to The                           
               Stanhope...for lunch?                                  

               Yes and guess what?    We saw                          
               nothing.                                               
     Jane and Harley connect.    He immediately looks away.           

               What is that supposed to mean?                         

               Who wants wine? Anyone?                                
                                                      

                                               
               Mom, you have an insane amount of
               food in here, even for you.





              (taking out last night's
               roast chicken)
          I knew you were all going to be
          here for the weekend so I made a
          bunch of stuff last night.


          Looks like Jake Adler's favorite
          meal to me.


              
          Very funny.


          Very.                                                 
Jane looks to Harley again when they all hear a car horn        
HONK. Jane LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and sees JAKE'S PORSCHE PULL    
UP with Luke in the passenger seat. The Girls rush out the      
Kitchen door. Harley sees Jake getting out of the car and       
pours himself a larger glass of wine as Jane approaches him.    

          Harley?                                               
Just then, Luke enters and Jane lights up.                      

          Yay!!!!
              


              
          Mom, this looks amazing.

Harley and Luke hug, talk the talk. `Sup? Yo...


                 (sheepishly joins the
                  group, eyes on Jane)
          Hi.


                 
          Hey.

Harley takes a huge gulp of his wine.                           

              
          Where should I put this...?





              (turns her back on him,
               making herself busy)
          Wherever.

Harley watches their interaction tennis match style. Jake
looks at the table set for five, wishes he was joining them.
He sees last night's dinner, now being served as left overs.
Jane slices the roast chicken.


          That looks incredible.                                
Jane looks up at him, knife poised.    Is he kidding?


          Thanks.

She goes at the chicken with the knife, slicing off a leg.
Jake flinches.


          Jake?   Glass of wine?


          Uh, sure.    Thanks.


          Jane?


              
          No thank you.

Jake's cell RINGS.    He turns his back to take it.


              
          Hi Ag... Just got here.

Jane has a hot flash.    Starts fanning herself.


              
          Okay, I will. Yeah, no, I know.
              
          I'm sorry guys, I gotta hit it.


          Bye-bye.

The Girls look to Jane.





I have to stop at the market.
Agness is making some pasta thing
and she ran out of olive oil.


Hey, at least she's finally
cooking.


So...see everybody at the party
tomorrow...                                

Yeah.   It's gonna be so fun.


    
I told you I'm bringing someone,
right?


No. Who?


Adam.   My architect.


You're bringing your architect?


Yes I am.


Like as a date?


    
Yeah.


I like the idea.


Me too.


Yeah, seems like it should round
out everything really nicely.
    
Nobody wants wine but me?




     Luke opens a cupboard, takes out a bottle of olive oil, hands
     it to Jake.


               Here, now you can stay another five
               minutes.
                   
               You have three bottles in there.


               Janey, can I talk to you privately?
               Just for a sec.

     Jane heads out still holding the carving knife.   Harley slips
     the knife out of her hand.


               There you go....
                   
               Somebody's talkin' graduation gift.



     Jane and Jake stand in the courtyard off of the Living Room.


               What is it, Jake?   What?


               I don't get not calling me back.


               `Cause I don't care what your
               excuse is.
                   (shuts the door to the
                    living )


               She didn't go out, Jane. She
               cancelled her plans and every
               time I tried to call or write, she
               caught me. I wanted to be here.


               You know what, Jake? You were
               worried about rocking the boat at
               home? Well now you're rocking my                        
               boat and I don't like it.


                   
               Honey, don't let one night...





You don't understand. I'm not even
blaming you. I fully participated
in this. But I don't want to do it
anymore. The last thing in the
world I should be right now is your
mistress, sitting around at nine at
night wearing heels and perfume and
blowing out candles and wrapping
everything in Saran Wrap because
your wife cancelled her plans. It
was cliche and humiliating.


    
You lit candles?


Oh, shut up. Look, I've had a
pretty good life these past 10
years. I figured it out and I
moved on. I no longer feel alone
or divorced. I just feel normal.
You know how long that took, just
to get my balance back?


No.


The point is, I'm going in the
wrong direction here. But the
worst part is... It's feeling like
it used to feel. All the little
untruths that are hard to catch but
add up...


-- Janey, c'mon, it was one
mistake...


    
-- Everything okay out here?
    
The kids are gettin' hungry...


Yeah. We're done.
    (walks away, pauses in
     front of Harley)
We were just...





              
          -- None of my beeswax, Jane.
              
          And please never tell me.

 Lauren joins.                                                    

          What's up?


          Nothin', punky.
              


                                         
          Yeah? So, we're going to see you                        
          tomorrow night, for sure, right?                        
Harley starts to follow them out when Jane grabs his shirt        
sleeve.                                                           

          Okay...What did you see and what do                     
          you know?                                               

          Nothing. Really.                                        
Jane gives him a look that could get blood from a stone.          

                                               
          Okay, he checked in, you arrived,                       
          you met in the elevator, possible                       
          kiss there, Doctor went up, Doctor                      
          came down, thumbs up. That's it.                        
          Have no idea what happened in                           
          between.                                                

                                                        
          Have you told Lauren?                                   

          No and I won't --                                       

                                                    
          Mom. Dad's leaving...                                   






      Jane and Harley ENTER from the courtyard just as Jake is          
      about to leave. Jane immediately crosses to the table which       
      now has dinner on it.                                             
      Lauren kisses Jake good-bye on the cheek then joins the           
      others who are about to sit down for dinner.                      

                                                  
                   Thanks for picking me up, Dad...

      Jake pauses awkwardly at the door. He can't catch Jane's          
      eye. He waves to the kids, who don't seem to notice then          
      heads out.                                                        


      Jake EXITS, turns back, looks INSIDE THE DINING ROOM, sees        
      his family sitting around the table, talking, laughing. He        
      heads toward his car as...                                        


      glances out the window at Jake as he drives off. One of the       
      kids says something, distracting her, and she laughs...



      Harley and Luke, on ladders, are stringing paper lanterns
      across a small patio. Lauren crosses under them, carrying a
      tray of food and joins Gabby who is setting out drinks.           




      Jane sits at her dressing table, dressed for the party. She       
      puts on hoop earrings -- likes the way she looks. She opens       
      a drawer to take out a lipstick.



      Sitting among her cosmetics is the joint Jake left for her.
      She looks at the joint, then looks at herself in the mirror.      







     He looks adorable and carries a gift the size of a book.    He
     knocks in a playful rhythm.



     all smiles.


               Hey....




     Very happy to see her.


               Hey.   You look fantastic.


               I'm feelin' a little fantastic.

     She OPENS THE DOOR A LITTLE WIDER and we NOW SEE she's eating
     a gi-normous piece of cake.


                   (trying not to react to
                    that, ENTERS, handing her
                    the gift.)
               This is for you.


               Really? Thank you! Come on in.
                   (takes a huge bite of
                    cake)
               Can you hold this for a sec?
                   
               Oh my God...
                   
               -- this could be the best cake I
               ever made. You want a piece? It's
               like... beyond...


               I think I'm good.


                   
               I can't believe you brought me a
               gift?! So nice!




     Jane unwraps the gift, turns it around, looks at it.


               An appointment book?


               I sort of assumed you didn't have
               one.


               --Because I never remember our...
               Awww....


               I took the liberty of filling in
               our next two meetings. And marked
               them with post-its and wrote them
               in red and then highlighted them in
               neon yellow.


               Thank you!

     Jane kisses Adam on the cheek just as he was moving and the
     kiss lands on his lips.


               Sorry.


               I'm not.
                   (Did he really say that?
                    Then, he licks his lips)
               Wow, that cake is good.

     Jane laughs a little too hard.




               So, let me ask you something and
               please don't think I'm weird or out
               of line or anything... but do you
               by any chance poke smot?                              

               Do I...??


               I mean do you smoke pot?! I
               haven't asked anyone that question
               since I was twenty-two.





          Uh. No, I don't. But I have. But
          I don't think I've had any since my
          kids were born...so not in like 27
          years.


          Oh my God, we have kids the same
          age! And I haven't had any since
          my kids were born either!!! Except
          for tonight. I had one hit off of
          this.

Jane pulls the joint out of her purse, just as they pull up
next to a Police Car.


          You might not want to hold that
          quite so...
              
          Hello Officer.


              (turns, SEES the Cop Car,
               GASPS and DROPS THE
               JOINT, then TURNS to Cop,
               waves, then:)                                   
          I actually know him! Blueberry
          scone and a latte.
              
          Oh my God! That was horrifying. I
          instantly saw myself in a mug shot.
          My heart is leaping out of my...
              
          Wow... This is the most insane
          dashboard I've ever seen. It's like
          we're in a cockpit. It's
          spectacular. Adam, what kind of
          car is this?


          Jane?


                
          Hi.


          Did you get this high from one hit?





               Yes! I don't know what they've                           
               done to pot over the last 30 years
               but it rockkkkks!                                        



     From OUTSIDE, we can see lots of folks in the Living Room.
     Candles dot the path up to the cottage door. Several Couples
     and College Kids are walking toward the house.


     Jane and Adam are sharing the joint.   Jane takes a tiny, lady-
     like hit, passes it to Adam.


                   
               Don't take too much, it's really
               strong.

     She blows out the smoke. Adam, on the other hand, takes a
     huge hit.


                   (while holding in the
                    smoke)
               I haven't had fun in almost three
               years, Jane.
                   
               Bring. It. On.




     walk past the bushes.


               Who's got the reefer?                                    

                   
               No one. Keep walking please.

     The Kids laugh.



     Jane and Adam, two very straight laced grown ups, ENTER the
     party, pausing as they peruse the crowd.





                  How you feeling?


                  Totally fine.


                  Me too.

     Adam starts to move to the music insanely well and then just
     insanely. Lauren and Harley greet them. Jane greets them
     back with a huge hug.


                  Hi... love your dress.   Hey Harls.


                      
                  Harls...?


                  Adam, this is my oldest, Lauren and
                  her fiance, Harley.                                   
                      
                  We're on a date.

     Adam and Jane stifle laughs.



     Jane and Adam chat with all the Kids.     Looks like it's going
     great -- Adam is a big hit.                                        


     Jake nurses a drink and is not looking happy. He sees the
     Kids disperse, finishes off his vodka, ready to make his
     move.



     Now alone.    They haven't seen Jake yet.


                      (starts moving to the                             
                       music - Jane laughs)                             
                  By the way -- How great is this
                  party? Let's be the last to leave.                    
                      (bops to the MUSIC then

                       ROOM, seriously eyeing
                       him.)


                    ADAM
          Hey, there's your ex-husb-- Uh-Oh.                     
          He's headed right toward us. Not                       
          the time to be "feeling groovy"                        
              (dances again when he sees                         
               Jake in SLOW-MO getting                           
               closer and closer)
          Oooo. Why so intense, big fella?

Adam slides a bit behind Jane as Jake arrives with Agness who
looks inappropriately youthful.


          Hello Jane.... Adam.


                                                     
          Hey, good to see you again.


          Adam, this is Agness, Jake's
          wife...
              
          Now that is an odd sentence for me
          to say since that was me for most
          of my life. Seriously. How weird
          is that? Both of us married to the
          same man!


              
          You know... it's... hey, what are                      
          you gonna do?


          Yeah, why go there.

At this point, Adam gets hit with a severe case of the           
giggles. As the rest continue, he can't keep a straight          
face.                                                            

          Because there, is...fascinating. I
          mean, when you think about it, it
          sort of links us in some cosmic                        
          crazy way, doesn't it, Agness? Of                      
          all the men on the planet, we both
          said "I do" to this guy.


          Yeah. Twenty-five years apart. I
          know you're having like an "Ah-Ha'
          moment, but I think I'm gonna get a
          refill. Adam, good meeting you.





                   (whispers to Jane as                                 
                    Agness exits)                                       
               She's got a really scary tattoo.                         

               Janey, can I talk to you for a
               quick sec?

     Jake nods his head toward the bathroom and heads for it. Jane
     looks to Adam.                                                     

               He always needs me for a quick sec.
                                                        
               You okay?                                                

               Oh, I'm very okay!                                       



     Jane and Jake are crammed into an extremely tight space.


               What's going on?    You're acting
               insane.


                   
               I'm stoned.


               What?! You smoked the joint I gave
               you?


               You told me to!    It's a-mazing!!!


               But you weren't supposed to smoke
               it with him, you're supposed to
               smoke it with me!


               Somebody's jealous....


               Yes, of course. Why shouldn't I
               be... you're my...





          -- What?   What am I, Jake?


          You're my ex-wife, lover, oldest
          friend and girlfriend.

Jane blurts out a laugh.


          Okay. You're hilarious. And
          because of that, even though I kind
          of hate you/love you, I'm going to
          let you have some...


          You love me? I mean, I heard "hate"
          had top billing, but...

Jane takes the joint out of her purse, lights it up and hands
it to Jake. Just as she does that, THE DOOR OPENS and HARLEY
ENTERS, thinking the bathroom is free. Jake quickly yanks
him in, shuts the door, locks it. Harley is now caught
between Jane and Jake and a cloud of smoke.


          Oh my God, you're smoking weed in
          the guest bathroom.


          Yes we are and we'd appreciate it
          if you didn't tell anyone about
          this.


          No. Never.     Adding it to the list.                  

          Care for a toke?


          I don't really smoke marijuana.


              
          Me either.


          Okay, one hit.


              (looks at herself in the
               mirror)


                         JANE
               Oh, my God. Is that what I look
               like?



     A small group is dancing to a hip hop song on the patio.           
     Adam and Agness are dancing together. They're totally into         
     it. Jane makes her way to the dance floor as the song ends         
     and The Beach Boys "Wouldn't It Be Nice" begins. Jake              
     follows Jane dancing his way toward the crowd, spinning Gabby      
     on his way. Jake takes Jane's hand...dances with her.
     Harley arrives next to Lauren and Gabby who watch their            
     parents.


               They must be hammered.


               Or something like that.

     Adam glances over and sees Jane and Jake.


                   
               Sweetest divorced couple in the
               world..!

     Agness is surprised by how happy Jake looks with Jane.


                   
               Hey..!
                   
               Jake, I'm gonna....                                      
     Jane and Adam cross toward one another. Jake dies a little
     as Jane leaves him, her eyes on Adam. Jake doesn't notice
     Agness is watching him.. Jane, now dancing with Adam, looks        
     from Adam to Jake then back to Adam and then doesn't look
     back at Jake again.

     Jake is still as he watches the woman he loves slip away.
     Agness has her eyes firmly on Jake, not missing any of it.



     Adam drives Jane home.   Clearly the end of a great night.         

               Wow. Fun is not overrated, is it?                        





               You know what's great?


               What?


               How much I like you.


                   
               Thank you... I really like you a
               lot too.... even though...oh.. you                     
               didn't say, "a lot".


               But I was thinking it.


               So... I'm not too old for you?


               How can you be too old for me when
               I'm older than you.


               I just figured all these women you
               get fixed up with are thirty-five.


               Your age is one of my favorite
               things about you.
                   
               Do you think you have any more of
               that chocolate cake at your house?                     

               Hungry?


               Starved!



     And we are IN THE BAKERY at ONE A.M. Jane turns on a few
     more lights, but keeps it a bit moody.


               Officially now the best date of my
               life. Pre or post divorce.





               Get out... All right....so
               basically I can make you anything
               on the menu or even not on the
               menu. Just name it.


               No?  Really? Okay.                                      
                   (scans the blackboard                               
                    menu)                                              
               What about a... warm chocolate
               croissant?


               My speciality!







     JANE FLOURS AND ROLLS CROISSANT DOUGH as Adam, now in an          
     apron, watches, chatting with her. Jane then places the           
     dough in a machine called a Sheeter. The dough slides into        
     the sheeter and then slides back out bigger and flatter.



     watching the sheeter, mesmerized.

     NEXT Jane folds the flattened dough, measures it with a yard      
     stick, then cuts it into sections. She takes one of the           
     sections, spreads it on a marble slab and very quickly cuts       
     it into triangles. She's a whiz at this.                          
     THEN, Jane shows Adam how to stretch the triangles of             
     dough.... Nervous at first, he gets the hang of it. Then,         
     Jane teaches Adam how to place a bar of chocolate in each         
     triangle and roll it into a croissant. Laughing as they           
     work, they make a dozen croissants... NEXT...into the OVEN.       



     Jane and Adam sit at a table in the corner, a stack of
     croissants piled high between them. Music plays as Adam
     takes the top croissant and Jane takes the next.





              
          Oh. Baby.


              
          Mmmmmmmm.


          It's crazy how good this is.


              
          Yeah, and I'm not even stoned
          anymore.


          Neither am I.


              
          Oh, then...merci, Monsieur.


          Do you remember when I asked you
          the other night, if you were dating
          anyone and you said no... It
          sounded to me like you were maybe
          saying yes.


          I was sort of seeing someone.     But,
          it's over now.
              
          Honestly.


          `Cause I'm not strong enough to
          fall for someone who's with someone
          else. Wouldn't be able to take
          that again.


          I understand. I wouldn't say it
          was over if it wasn't.

Adam takes Jane's hand in his...relieved.


          Great.                                           
Adam turns Jane's hand over and looks at it a bit
quizzically.





                      
                  Cooking scar.... From a very hot
                  batch of caramel...


                  Ooooo. What about that one?


                  That one's from boiling sugar...I
                  wasn't very skilled in the
                  beginning.    And that one is from a
                  large French...

     Adam presses Jane's palm to his lips and kisses her scar.


                  -- Saute pan.

     Adam then kisses the burn on her forearm. Jane sighs, closes
     her eyes. This feeling is unexpected. She opens her eyes as
     Adam moves closer.


                  Would it be okay if I...?

     Jane nods.    He kisses her great.


                  I was going to say, kiss you.


                  I figured.


                  If you feel this is in any way
                  wrong because we're working
                  together...


                  ... I don't ...

     He smiles as she folds into him and they kiss and kiss and
     kiss again.









Quiet. Jane enters from the garden, humming, "Wouldn't It Be      
Nice." Luke ENTERS, still looking half asleep in his T Shirt      
and boxers.                                                       

          Hey sleepy! What time did you get
          in?


          Have no idea. Lauren and Harley
          drove me home.


              
          I'm surprised you remember that.


              
          Hi. I didn't know you slept here.

Lauren, in an open robe over drawstrings and a tank top,
takes out a box of cereal.


          We were playing Scattagories with
          Gabby and Ollie then Harley fell                        
          asleep on the couch.

Harley meanders in wearing Victoria Secret Heart patterned PJ
bottoms and a Girl's V-neck T-shirt.


          Sweet.


          I got cold in the middle of the
          night.

Lauren and Jane laugh.


          Okay, who wants what?
                                         
          Hi baby...                                              

              (looks out the front                                
               window)                                            
          What's Dad doing here?                                  




     Everyone LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW and SEES Jake sitting in his
     Porsche.



     Jane EXITS as Jake steps out of his car. He looks like he's
     had a rough night and has something on his mind. Jane
     cautiously looks back at the house. The kitchen windows are
     all open.


                   
               Everything okay?


               I left Agness.


               No, don't say that.


               She saw it my eyes, Janey.


               Saw what?


               That I'm still in love with you.   I
               admitted it, I told her about us
               and I've left her. For you.


               No, no, no.... What do you mean???
               Jake, this is crazy!
                   (worried the kids will
                    hear, whispers)
               Are you telling me the truth?


                   
               This feels so right Jane.

     As Jane is about to respond, Gabby EXITS the house in her          
     PJ's, looking confused.


                   
               What's going on?


               Nothing. Honey, set the table,
               I'll be right in.





             Mom, you're the only one who cares
             if the table's set.


             Okay, then do it for me....just go
             in please.

Luke and Lauren join Gabby on the porch.                          

             What's up, Dad?


             Having some problems on the home
             front, just wanted to talk to your
             Mom for a sec.

Jane shakes her head.    Why did he have to say that?   Harley
joins the Kids.                                                   

             Problems on the home front?   Is one
             of you seeing someone else?

Hearing that, Harley does a swift about face and goes right       
back inside. Jane's eyes widen toward Jake.


                 
             No, it's nothing like that. I just
             need to find a hotel or something
             for a few days `til I get my head
             together.


             It's that serious?

Jake nods.


             Mom, can Dad stay here for a few
             days? He can share my room.


             I don't think that's the best idea,
             Luke.


             Daddy, are you crying?






     He turns away from the kids.   The tears could be for dramatic
     effect, could be real.


               I'm sorry.

     All Three Kids immediately well up and look at Jane.


                   
               Mom........



     Jane nervously nibbles on her fingernail as the family sits
     silently around the table watching a ravenous Jake eat French
     Toast, bacon, coffee, side of fruit. His mood has been
     lifted. His energy is in full bloom.


               Mommy's the best cook in the world!



     Jane is working in the garden. A shadow falls over her.    She
     looks up, Jake stands before her, a cute smile breaking
     across his face.


               Thank you for saving me Janey.


               Jake, you knew the kids were all
               here. Shouldn't we have talked
               about this? Agreed this was the
               right thing to do? This is so
               typical. Only thinking about works
               for you.


               I'm sorry, I guess I should've
               called before showing up.


               -- And I'm not sure you even left
               Agness. Maybe she saw something
               last night and threw you out...





          What's the difference? I was
          drowning over there. I'm not going
          to get that many more chances in my
          life to figure myself out. Janey,
          let's use these couple of days to
          see if we can make this work.


          We can't, Jake. I told you this
          the other night. Please listen.


          But you were all pissy because you
          thought I stood you up. Things are
          different now. I'm a free man.
              
          Can we just hug? I hate that
          you're being so distant. It's
          literally giving me a pain in my
          stomach.


          Oh, God...

Jane reluctantly hugs him.      He tries to kiss her.


          See!    Too much!


          Okay!    Good note.

Jane can't help but smile.


          Can I help with what you're doing?
          Hold your basket or...


          I'm fine....


          Okay... I'm going to go to the
          video store and get us all a dvd to
          watch tonight. We'll have movie
          night. Just like old times. How's
          that? I'll make the popcorn.                          
Just then Jane's Cell RINGS.





                Fine.
                    
                Hello...


                    
                I love knowing I'm coming back
                here.


                     
                Oh, hi... I slept great. How `bout
                you?

      Jake waits, but realizes Jane's not going to turn back.



      The Adlers are watching The Graduate. The lights are low.
      Jake, shoes off, hands everyone bowls of popcorn. Jane sits
      in a club chair. Harley's on the floor and the Adler Kids
      are on one long sofa, all covered in a blanket. Jake hands
      them popcorn then squeezes back in, between the Girls.





                Are you here for an affair, sir?


                What?


                The Singleman party, sir?

      Jane cringes as the Kids laugh. She looks over at Jake
      snuggling between the Kids, all eating popcorn and laughing.
      He catches Jane's eye and mouths.












      Jake, bare legged and wearing a robe and slippers, crosses to
      the KITCHEN where he finds Luke and Gabby digging through the    
      fridge.


                Any leftovers?


                Are you kidding?
                    (takes out an armful of
                     Tupperware)


                Any of that noodle thing left?
                                               
                Where's Mom? She disappeared so
                fast after the movie.


                She's probably sleeping.


                I think she's on her computer.

      They all nibble out of Tupperware, leaning against various
      counters.


                Tonight was weird.


                So weird. Still is.


                I loved tonight.


                Yeah. That's why it was so weird.
                Just seeing you in your robe in our
                kitchen. Remember when you weren't
                even allowed in. Mom used to go out
                to the car to talk to you...


                    (handing Gabby his                                 
                     Tupperware)
                You know, I don't even really
                remember you and Mom as a couple.





          What do you mean... you were ten
          when we broke up.


          I was eight actually and I don't
          know...it's all foggy to me now.


          You don't remember us in Hawaii or
          all sleeping in that tent in the
          backyard.


          Yeah, of course, but I don't
          remember like you and Mom hugging
          or waking up together...

Jake grabs his heart, moans.


          -- It's okay. I'm not damaged or
          anything. You've been good
          parents...


          Speak for yourself dude. I'm
          definitely damaged from the
          divorce.

Harley and Lauren ENTER.   Lauren turns the tea kettle on.


          Hello troops.


          Why are you still here?


          I don't know, you and Mom sleeping
          in the same house. Harley thought
          we should stay.

Jake turns his beams on Harley.


          She exaggerates. I just thought
          perhaps you might want to talk
          later, or ... Is that the noodle
          thing?


          Oh. Sorry. I think I ate it all.





                Dad!


                I didn't know anyone wanted any.



      Jane, sits on her bed, talking to Adam via iSight. On her
      LAPTOP SCREEN, we see Adam but he's a bit of a BLUR.


                Wait, I can't see that one.    Can
                you back up a little?



      He back ups from the lens and models a rather ridiculous ski
      sweater.


                    
                Very festive...


                O-kay. Thank you.
                    
                Gift from my ex-sister-in-law.
                Have no idea why I kept it.
                    
                Into the pile. Hey, check out the
                pile, Jane.

      Adam POINTS HIS LAPTOP to the floor to show a HUGE STACK OF



                Nice!
                    
                Hey, the pile's moving....


                Murphy, get out of there!

      A small Mutt scurries out of the pile.   Jane laughs.              

                    (re-enters in an odd
                     shirt)
                What about this?   I was in India
                and I had it made.


                    ADAM
          The guy ran out of fabric so he
          didn't make me long sleeves.
              
          Or short sleeves. It's weird.


          And kinda girly.


              
          Not what I'm going for.
                                           
          Gray sweater. Very old.                              

          But cute.


              
          You sure? You don't have to say you
          like it just because you nixed the
          last 20 things.

Jane likes this man.


          Keep it. It's cozy.   Boy, you have
          a lot of clothes.


              
          Uh, not anymore. Okay, we're
          almost done. You are helping me so
          much by the way.


          -- Adam, I really have to pee.


          Oh good. Me too. Meet you back in
          thirty....
              
          Putting this on my desk....



Just a shot of Jane's Pillows on her bed.


          I'm not in there...







                 Can't hear you.



       Jake pokes his head in, looks around, sees no one in the
       room. He hears Jane in the bathroom and ENTERS quietly,
       quickly squirms out of his boxers and T-shirt, then, DROPS      
       HIS ROBE, and lies on his side, on the bed, completely NUDE --
       elbow up, palm supporting his head -- a smile on his face. He
       changes his smile to a smoulder.

       Jake hears water running. Suddenly modest, he quickly drags
       over the open Laptop and places the open screen in front of
       his privates. He smiles, ready to be discovered.




A104   dries her hands at the bathroom sink.                      A104    



       Adam crosses through the room on his way to his laptop.

105    JANE ENTERS HER BEDROOM, SEES JAKE and lets out a SCREAM. 105

       Simultaneously, ADAM PLOPS DOWN IN HIS DESK CHAIR, LOOKS AT
       HIS SCREEN and instantly YANKS HIMSELF AWAY in disgust.


                 Mother of --
                     
                 Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!

       Jake LOOKS DOWN AT THE SCREEN,    SEES ADAM'S SCREAMING FACE



                 What are you doing in here?!!!


                     (covering the screen with
                      his hands)
                 Get it off!!!


                     
                 I wanted to see you.





          Why are you naked!?!


              (sits up straight, the lap
               top shooting even more
               directly at his groin)
          Why do you think?


          Okay, I'm gonna be sick.

Jake LEANS IN, covers Adam's eyes on the screen, which, of
course, does nothing.


          Not working! Big close up!

Jake rises, now his ass gets the close up, he bends over to
get his robe.


          Okay!   Good night!

Jake SPINS THE LAPTOP and the ISIGHT LENS LANDS ON JANE.
Jane and Adam look at one another. No time to say anything.
She's desperate. He's lost.

The DOOR FLIES OPEN, the KIDS RUSH IN, just as Jake ties his
robe.


          Everybody okay?

No one says anything.


          What's happening?

Adam listens, his eyes on Jane. Jake crosses to Jane, facing
the Kids. He walks in and out of the iSight shot.


          Okay. Let me explain. The reason I
          left Agness wasn't just because my
          marriage wasn't working.
              
          I've also fallen in love...back in
          love... with your mother. Or maybe
          I never stopped loving her.


          Is this a joke?                                       





                I know this is shocking, but I
                think this is the best thing that's
                ever happened to me. Your Mom and
                I have been seeing each other, on
                the side... ever since New York.


                Mom, is this true?


                    
                That part is, but..


                I found my way back home.     I just
                hope she'll take me back.

      Gabby breaks down in tears.    Lauren puts her arm around her.    
      Jane starts to cry, looks at her laptop, just as she HEARS A
      CLICK and THE LAPTOP SCREEN GOES BLACK.


                Why's everyone crying?     Why isn't
                this good news?


                Because we're still getting over                        
                the divorce.                                            

                Mom, are you and Dad getting back
                together?


                No... we're not.

      Jane looks at the Kids with incredible sadness.



      The Kids, in their cars, drive down the road, away from the
      house. Jane stands in the driveway, watching, never before
      feeling quite like this. Jake EXITS THE HOUSE, holding his
      bag. He stops, looks at Jane. She has nothing left to say.
      Jake gets in his car and pulls away as Jane walks back
      inside.








      Jane lies on a pool chaise, wrapped in a blanket, tissues in
      hand. She stares up at the night sky and as her eyes flutter
      shut, we drift off of her...                                       





      CAMERA DRIFTS ACROSS THE POOL TO JANE, asleep on the pool          
      chaise, still wrapped in a blanket. The sprinklers go off          
      and wake Jane. She opens her eyes, looks around, realizes          
      she's spent the night outside.

      Jane sits up too fast, a tad disoriented, then quickly             
      realizes what she must do.                                         



      bed-headed and still in his pj's. He approvingly looks at
      Jane, who stands across from him, ready to right it all.


                Glad you're here, boss.



      Harley leads Jane down the narrow hall to the Bedroom.


                Now I know you don't need my advice                      
                Jane, but...                                             

                I got this one...                                        

                I know you do.                                           
      Jane pauses, Harley nods for her to go inside.                     



      Her Three Kids are under the covers. Lauren is between Gabby       
      and Luke. They look like they just woke up.



Jane stands in the doorway. The Kids don't say a word. Jane
doesn't wait. She crosses to the bed, sits on it, looks at
her children.


          Knowing how to be divorced is next
          to impossible... and sometimes over
          the years, I've thought that your
          Dad and I weren't quite finished.
          And, as it turns out, we weren't.
          So I went out of my comfort zone,
          which, I found out, if you're
          really honest with yourself, isn't
          all that comforting. So, I
          experimented with a part of myself.
          I wanted to find out if, after all
          these years there was still
          something there between us.


          And was there?


          There kinda was.

Lauren smiles with her eyes.


          But Mom, you have to understand how
          bonkers this sounds to us. For two
          people who for years couldn't be in
          the same room together...to then
          have an affair??? You and Dad...!


          I know...it was hard for me and I
          was doing it. I hope you'll
          forgive me for confusing you or
          betraying your trust, but I did
          this for me and for him and I
          realized even though your Dad and I
          once had something extraordinary...
          we no longer really fit together.
          But he is a part of me and always
          will be.


          So it's over now? You guys are
          back to being divorced.


          For better or for worse.




      Lauren takes her Mom's hand. Harley joins them, sitting on
      the other side of the bed, holding back tears.


                Group hug?

      And as they all move into hug, we:





      REVERSE ON JANE walking through Adam's firm.    She arrives at:


      Adam is on a phone call.


                    
                Yeah no problem...we can definitely
                do that...
                    
                -- James, can I call you back,
                someone just... Thanks.
                    
                Hi.


                Hi. May I come in?


                -- Sure.


                I didn't call you last night                             
                because I wasn't sure you would
                take the call and then I thought
                that could go on for months and...                       

                -- I would have taken the call.


                Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to
                say these things in person. Adam,
                the man I was seeing was...


                I think I'm up to speed on that
                part.





          I want you to know it didn't last
          long and you're divorced, so maybe
          you understand, when marriages end,
          there's doubts and hurt, and you've
          got kids and sometimes you wonder
          if you did the right thing and when
          the moment presented itself...


          -- I get it. I could imagine it...I
          could...


          I told him it wasn't going to work
          between us but I guess he didn't
          believe me and unbeknownst to me,
          he showed up at my house yesterday.
          He left Agness and...


          -- Jane. I actually think I
          understand what happened
          but...uh...you know I'm not as
          macho as I appear and I think it's
          probably best for us not to get any
          more... involved because your
          relationship with Jake isn't really
          done and I know you're saying it
          is, but he's in love with you and
          for everyone's sake, that should
          probably get resolved.


          Wow.   So that's how grown ups talk.

Adam smiles.


          Please tell me you're not going to
          quit my job and ask Peter to take
          over because then I'll never get to
          see you and...


          I was thinking of asking Peter to
          step back in.


          Oh... I hope you don't...


          Thanks.









      Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her
      driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the
      bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard.

      Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in
      this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a
      sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.


                I'm sorry.

      Jane doesn't answer right away.


                How far back does that sorry go?


                How far back do you need it to go?


                Way back.


                Consider it an all inclusive
                apology. From not being the
                husband you needed to showing up
                nude on your bed last night.


                Yeah, what were you thinking with
                that move?


                That you'd find me irresistible.

      Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.


                Never considered the alternative.


                Gotta love that about you.

      They swing some more.





Oh, man, can't believe I got up to
bat again and blew it.


You didn't blow it. We blew it.
We blew it the first time around.
This time... we just should've
known better. Too much has
happened. Too much time has passed.


And you don't think we could make
it right?                                      

Does that mean you didn't feel it
was totally right either?                      

Being with you Jane is the best I'm
gonna be.


But do you agree that it wasn't
really...?                                     

It was complicated.


Begging for an answer.


I thought it was good.   I wanted it
to be good.


Guess that's as close as I'm gonna             
get.


Do you always have to be so hard on
me?


No.   I don't.


I don't regret giving it another
shot.





                Probably would've been better if
                you hadn't been married.


                It may never have happened if I
                wasn't married.

      Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side       
      by side, as they sway in the breeze.                               

                I don't regret it either.

      They continue rocking, not much more to say.   As CAMERA PULLS     
      AWAY, we:                                                          




      It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber
      is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps.

      Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A
      GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift          
      tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to           
      face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints. Jane is              
      stunned he's there.                                                

                Good morning.


                Good morning.


                Did you know it's good luck to
                start building in the rain?


                Really?


                    
                Yes. It's a well known, very good,
                really lucky omen.

      Thunder rattles the sky.





              
          Good, I could use one.
              
          Would you all like to have your
          meeting in the house...it's dry and
          I've got hot coffee...

The Group thanks her and heads for the house. Adam stays
back and walks next to Jane. It's a long second before
someone talks.


          Jane, I need to ask you                                
          something...                                           

          Anything...                                            

          You wouldn't happen to have any of                     
          those amazing chocolate croissants,
          would you?


          Oh.... you like those, huh?                            

          I have incredibly fond memories of                     
          them.                                                  

          I don't have any here, but we could                    
          go into town and get some... right                     
          out of the oven.                                       
They turn toward the house and on their backs we hear:           

          You want to do that?                                   

          Yeah... love to.                                       
And as they walk away from Camera, we:
