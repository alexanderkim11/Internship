          A COMET streaks towards us. We FOLLOW as it blasts past.
          The ground plane rushes up to camera. BLACK.

           No one knows where it came from.
           There had been others. Mysterious
           relics of another world. But only
           one with the power to stop the

          Suddenly, we are blinded by a powerful TUNNEL OF LIGHT.
          It's an animated LEGO version of the light tunnel in

          REVEAL LEGO INDIANA JONES and two GUIDES. Indy puts up a
          hand for them to stop. He removes a RUBY RED PIECE from
          his bag and connects it to the temple. The piece GLOWS.
                         
          A dark passageway opens, and Indy lights a torch. The
          flames are made of ANIMATED LEGO BRICKS. The guides are
          too scared to continue. Indy's not.
                         
                         

                         
          A beautiful room made entirely of GOLDEN BRICKS. In the
          center is a GOLDEN SARCOPHAGUS guarded by statues of gods
          from every ancient civilization imaginable.
                         
          Indy carefully lifts a tablet from a statue of Zeus and
          places it into the sarcophagus like an ATM card. He
          pushes a bunch of cuneiform buttons - a PIN NUMBER.
                         
          The sarcophagus opens. A white-hot glow on Indy's face.
                         
          BLAM!!! The entire room shakes. The statues are blown
          apart!
                         
          The smoke clears. Enter THE BLACK FALCON, the most evil
          person in the universe. He's flanked by ROBOT guards.

           Hey Indy. Uch. Who built this
           place? Must have been a bunch of
           lazy hippies, sitting around a
           table agreeing with each other.
                         

           It was built by the ancients.
           With more wisdom and artistry than
           you can ever know.
                         
          The Black Falcon basks in the glow of the sarcophagus.
                         

           The Kragle...

           must be protected!

                         
                         

           What a lame boyscout thing to say!
           You're standing before the most
           powerful object in the world and
           you don't want to use it? You're a
           real nerd, Indiana Jones.
                         
          The BF motions and his guards carry the sarcophagus away.
                         

           The MasterBuilders will learn of
           this.
                         

           And what do you know of them?
                         

           Only that they will be your
           undoing.
                         

           Adieu, Dr. Jones. That's French
           for ciao.
                         
          He exits. As the sarcophagus crosses the threshold of
          the temple, walls shake. The temple is CRUMBLING.
                         
          Left for dead, Indy uses the falling pieces to build
          himself a sweet rocket ship and blasts out of the temple.
          Narrowly avoiding a big rolling LEGO ball, probably.

           Okay.
                         
          BOOM. Something big just landed outside. Indy looks at
          his foot. Attached is a blinking red brick. Oh no.

          The MasterBuilders fight valiantly but are overwhelmed.
                         
          Gemini runs from the fight, then stumbles, overcome with
          emotion as we hear the battle being lost. Amid the
          screams, Krav M'Ga's final words echo through Gemini's

           cleaning woman is coming today!
                         

           Then why do I need to clean?

           nice rule-following son I have!
                         
          Doris walks into his meticulously clean room to find
          Emmet, 22, a total square, in his underpants.

          Emmet "pulls" on a pair of mini-fig legs. Replaces his
          torso with a shirt. Takes off his hair and puts on a
          construction hat. Ready for work. Doris is so proud.
                         

           I just love you and want my son to
           be safe and happy. Can't you work

          Everyone dutifully draws the same drawing of a hand, but
          Emmet draws two hands close together so they look like

           I hated that day. The kids were so
           mean, the school tried to expel
           you... I promised myself I'd never
           let anything like that happen to
           you again. And it hasn't. So you
           need to let your memory of that

          EMPURA, a company which apparently owns everything.
                         
                         

                         
          Everyone walks in the same direction and goes in to
          various identical-seeming coffee shops.
                         
          SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE: A camera scans for something, or
          someone, but can't tell Emmet from the rest of the crowd.
                         
                         

                         
          A Starbucks by a different name. Mixed with a Hot Dog on
          a Stick. Emmet arrives at the counter.
                         

           Hello.
                         

           What'll it be?
                         

           I'm Emmet.

                         
                         

          Larry?
                         

          Well, Larry, I'll have one coffee
          please.
                         

          Cappuccino, macchiato, espresso,
          americano.
                         

          What are those? Sounds a little
          foofy.
                         

          They're all coffee.
                         

          Oh. Well, whatever isn't too wild.
          I don't know, what do you think?

                         

          A decaf.
                         

          Okay, yeah. Cool.
                         

          Venti, Grande, or Super Grande?
                         

          Oh, goodness. So much selection.
          So hard to decide! You pick.
                         

          That's a personal decision that
          only you can make.
                         

          Uh. Gosh, which is the most
          popular?
                         

          Super Grande. It's Italian for
          medium.
                         

          Medium. That's what I'm havin'!
          That is my style.
                         

          Fantastic.

                         
                         

           You creative types! So
           delightfully sardonic!
                         

           I push one of two buttons on a
           machine. I would hardly call that
           creative. I would call that
           following instructions.
                         

           But it says Kreative right on your
           shirt! With an extra "kreative"
           spelling aberration! I totally
           don't get it!
                         
                         

                         
          As Emmet exits the shop and passes an EMPURA billboard
          asking him to reelect President Iamnotarobot.
                         
          A television in a shop window shows highlights of a
          debate between Iamnotarobot and Stooge Strawman.
                         
          Emmet finishes the drive to work. Everyone pulls into
          their parking spaces at the same time, like clockwork.
                         
          Emmet walks out and looks at his new work place. His
          breath is taken away as he gazes on a beautiful...
                         
                         

                         
          A fantastical construction site. Super-awesome cranes.
          Emmet walks and talks to his new boss.
                         

           Alright, kid. Here's the rules.
                         

           Ooh, great.
                         

           Stay on your feet--
                         

           Mmm hmm.
                         

           Stick to the instructions--
                         

           Uh huh.

                         
                         

           And don't get creative!
                         
          Emmet GUFFAWS like that's the craziest idea ever.
                         

           Oh, Steve, don't worry. I'm not
           some kind of foofy weirdo, Steve!
                         
          The laugh together for a LONG TIME. Then,
                         

           It's Sean.
                         
                         

                         
          They walk past BIG STACKS OF PIECES moved by MACHINES.
                         

           The pieces get sent down from
           corporate bundled together with
           the instructions. Take the one
           with your section on it and follow
           it to the letter. Keep track of
           all the pieces. If you lose one of
           the special ones it'll seriously
           drive you crazy.
                         
                         

                         
          They casually step across girders high above the city.
                         

           Today you'll be putting together
           an artists' loft.
                         

           Is it for an artist?
                         

           Oh, no. It's for an accountant.
                         

           Oh, great.
                         

           Pretty soon, the whole city will
           look like this. All part of some
           big master plan from Central.
                         

           Wow...

                         
                         
          They arrive at the COOLEST CONSTRUCTION MACHINE EVER.
          Emmet opens up his actual size LEGO instructions.
                         

           What if I mess up or lose my place
           or something?
                         

           Just do what everyone else does.
           Keep your head down, follow
           instructions, and you could get
           promoted. Central's got some big
           project coming up overseas.
                         

           Overseas? I don't know. I'm not
           big on travel.
                         

           Whatever, kid.
                         

           One more question.
                         
          Emmet puts a hand on his shoulder.
                         

           Thank you. For making my dreams
           come true.
                         

           Is that a question?
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet puts his hands on the controls, savoring this
          moment, and finally puts his first brick in, according to
          the plan. It's an awesome feeling. Another. Another.
          He gets in the zone of building. This feels right.
                         
                         

                         
          Lunchtime. Emmet looks at a heart-shaped COOKIE his mom
          baked for him. "I love you" in frosting. He flips it
          over. "Be Safe!" He looks over to the other INSTRUCTION
          WORKERS, eating lunch.
                         

           So.
                         
          Silence.

                         
                         

          How about that local sports team?
          What do you think of how they
          played the other day?
                         

          Ugh, they were awful.
                         

          Right? They should make a
          personnel change of some kind.
                         


                         

          Yes, the coach!
                         

          He's the only good thing about
          that team.
                         

          They should so keep him!
                         

          We're all going to watch the game
          after work. Eat a little grub.
          Want to join?
                         

          Really?!

          Actually, I'm supposed to have
          dinner with my-- What the heck?
          I'm in.
                         

          Alright then.
                         

          Cool. Definitely cool.

          Hey did you hear that song on the
          way in to work this morning?
                         

          Everything is Awesome? I love
          that song.
                         

          Me too!

                         
                         

           I think I know why I like that
           song so much.
                         

           Why's that?
                         

           Because everything is awesome.
                         

           Oh yeah. / Good point. / I never
           thought of it like that.
                         
          Emmet smiles his butt off.
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet is back to building. He takes a look at the city
          from the highest height. It's beautiful. He's downright
          INSPIRED looking at it. He sees the LEGO brick clouds in
          the sky slowly form the shape of a FACE.
                         
          We ZOOM IN to Emmet's MIND. We see LEGO SYNAPSES firing.
          A CONNECTION between two halves of the brain. An IDEA.
                         
          We pull back to REVEAL that Emmet has accidentally built,
          instead of a window, a SMILING FACE, reminiscent of the
          one he drew in class all that time ago.
                         

           Kid! What the heck is that?!
                         

           Oh, uh. I don't know. What?
                         

           That's not the instructions.
                         

           I don't know what happened. I was
           just looking out at the clouds,
           and-- It was an accident.
                         
          The Foreman picks up the phone.
                         


           We got a loose brick! Code Danger!
                         

           Code Danger? What's so dangerous?

                         
                         
          Just then, A CRANE OPERATOR notices the happy face. His
          distraction causes the crane to go in the wrong direction
          and SMASH a wall. The falling bricks cause an elaborate
          chain reaction that tips the structure over.
                         

           Oh.
                         
          Chaos! Instruction workers run away for their lives!
                         
                         

                         

           Loose brick!
                         

           Loose brick!
                         

           Loose brick!
                         
          The cops throw their lunch out the window, shattering it.
          They pop the sirens and take off!
                         
                         

                         
          The cops hit the gas! We PULL WIDER revealing dozens of
          other POLICE CARS doing the same. Sirens blaring.
                         
                         

                         
          The condo tips over an adjacent condo (with someone
          living in it, of course) which hits another and another,
          the buildings going down like elaborate dominoes.
                         
          Thirty COP CARS, an AMBULANCE and FIRE TRUCK screech in.
          Cops run full tilt to keep the buildings from falling.
                         

           Stop that building!
                         
          The cops jump out and stare up at the last domino, which
          falls on them. SMASH! The remaining cops look at Emmet.
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet is in the back of the car.

          Emmet is being booked.
                         

           --eriously, a model citizen. I

          Emmet sits chained to a desk in the shadow of two
          DETECTIVES. They look slicker than the others.
                         

           --swear, I'm not special at all.
           Just ask my mom! I'm a totally

           Dammit! I can't break him.
                         

           You don't need to break me! I'm
           just a regular old totally

                         

                         
                         

                         
          Emmet is in jail. He has a huge scary convict roommate.
                         

           I'm Emmet. What's your name?
                         



                         
                         

                         
                         

                         
          Doris sits at an empty dinner table set for two. She
          picks at her food and sighs. Her only company is the TV.
                         

           ...we're still following the story
           of the construction worker who got
           a little creative on his first day
           on the job. The subject was
           described as looking and acting
           exactly like everybody else...
           Police have taken the nondescript
           suspect into custody, and he is
           being held in the city jail.
                         
          Doris sees the brick happy face and knows it has to be
          Emmet! She looks worried. Then oddly STEELY.
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet lies awake, sad.
                         
                         

                         
          Something is moving in the field outside Emmet's Cell.
          It's DORIS! She pulls apart bricks in the ground.
                         
                         

                         
          CLOSE ON A RACQUEL WELCH POSTER. A blowdart gun emerges
          from her belly-button. TH-THOONK! Two guards outside
          Emmet's cell go down. DORIS bursts through the poster!
                         
          The following conversation is WHISPERED.
                         

           Mom? What are you doing here?
                         

           I'm breaking you out.
                         

           But, that's breaking the rules.
           You told me never to do that.

                         
                         

           Well I'm temporarily reversing my
           position for reasons of
           convenience.
                         

           What?
                         

           The rules are different now.
                         

           But I did something really bad.
                         

           No you didn't.
                         

           Mom. You taught me to be a person
           of principle, and I stand by my
           principles of doing whatever
           authority tells me to.
                         

           Great. Fine. Would you mind
           holding my purse?
                         

           Sure.
                         
          THOONK! Doris blowdarts Emmet, who passes out. Doris
          drags Emmet by the purse through the hole.
                         
                         

                         
          Doris and Emmet tunnel in, to the surprise of CUSTOMERS.
          Doris tries to make Emmet seem like a normal shopper. He
          is still holding her purse in a coma-grip.
                         
          GROCERY SECURITY CAMERA: zooms in on Doris. We see face
          recognition graphics, then zoom in on her BIRTHMARK.
                         
                         

                         
          Doris pushes him in a shopping cart through the parking
          lot and into an ALLEY. Emmet comes to.
                         

           Wh-- what are you doing?
                         

           Saving your life.

                         
                         

          Where did you get a blowdart?
                         

          That's not important.
                         

          Half my body is numb! My hand is
          stuck shut! That seems important!
                         

          I just broke you out of prison!
                         

          For a misdemeanor! They didn't
          even decide how long I'd be in
          there for yet.
                         

          They won't ever decide. You don't

                         

          You don't understand! I was
          having the best day of my life
          today. I was one of the guys. We
          were going to go to a dinner and
          talk about life and stuff--
                         

          You were supposed to have dinner
          with me.
                         

          I was going to call.
                         

          Well it feels amazing to spend
          twenty years loving and protecting
          someone and the first day out of
          the nest they wind up on the news.
                         

          I made a mistake. I'll explain it
          to the judge tomorrow and
          everything will be fine. Only it
          won't because I can't because
          suddenly I am an ESCAPED FUGITIVE!
                         

          It's for your own good.

                         
                         

           You can't protect me my whole
           life.
                         

           You wanna bet? Come on.
                         
          A beat. Doris continues but Emmet doesn't follow.
                         

           Mom, I'm going back to jail to
           repay my debt to society. A
           society that I would like to be a
           part of.
                         

           You have to trust me--
                         

           You have to trust me! I'm my own
           person. You have to let me grow
           up and make my own choices--
                         

           I tried, and look what happened!
                         

           Maybe if you didn't mother me so
           much I'd have been a little better
           equipped. Ever think of that?
                         

           As a matter of fact I did. All
           the time.
                         

           Ugh. You know what you are, Mom?
           You want to really know? A real
           pain in the elbow!
                         
          He turns away from her. Behind Emmet, three ROBOTIC
          NINJAS silently land, and shoot a human-sized RUBBER BAND
          from a bent PAPERCLIP at Doris-- it wraps around her,
          tying her up! They grab her and pull her into a SLEEK

                         

           Emmet!
                         


                         
          He whips around just in time to see her being taken.

                         
                         


                         

           Mom? Mom!!!!
                         
          Emmet is TACKLED by a hooded figure: GEMINI.
                         

           Where did she go?!
                         

           What's happening?!
                         
          Gemini grabs a mailbox and STARTS TAKING IT APART! Does
          the same with the shopping cart and other nearby items,
          REBUILDING them into an awesome mailbox-style SUPERCYCLE!
                         

           How did you--
                         
          Gemini takes OFF! Emmet, in pursuit, runs into TRAFFIC.
          He flags down a DUMPY CAR.
                         

           My mom got kidnapped by ninjas
           then a lady turned a mailbox into
           a motorcycle and now we have to
           catch up to them! Oh, hi, Larry.
                         
          It's the guy from the coffee shop.
                         

           Get in, I guess?
                         
          Emmet gets in and slams his foot on the gas!
                         

           What's with the purse?
                         


           It's my mom's.
                         
                         

                         
          Everyone is going in the exact same direction. Except
          three cars driving madly against traffic! So begins the
          craziest, most wonderful LEGO CAR CHASE OF ALL TIME!

                         
                         

                         
          Doris is tied up in the back in the rubber band.
                         

           What do you want with me?!
                         

           You know what we want.
                         

           You have the wrong person!
                         

           Do we?
                         
          He pulls back her sleeve, revealing the star-shaped mark.
                         
                         

                         
          Gemini tries to keep up with the ninja car. Emmet, in
          Larry's car, catches up. They are going super fast and
          dodging cars while screaming across traffic.
                         
          Emmet leans out of the car.
                         

           Mom! I'm sorry! Don't worry, I'm
           going to save you!
                         

           Stop, Emmet! You're going to
           screw everything up!
                         

           No, I'm not! How do you know my
           name?
                         
          He loses control of the car and CRASHES INTO Gemini! The
          cars tumble in a big heap. You can't tell where the car
          stops and the motorcycle begins. Larry and Emmet are
          upside down in seatbelts.
                         
          Gemini is thrown from the cycle during the crash, but
          gets up and rebuilds the two vehicles into one SUPER CAR
          CYCLE that's a mashup of both! Gemini is in the driver's
          seat, Emmet in passenger, and Larry in the back.
                         

           What the FLIPPING FLIP IS

          SLOW MOTION: The car smashes into pieces and Gemini
          rebuilds them, incorporating some of the billboard pieces
          into the restored vehicle.
                         
          The new vehicle hits the ground and continues in pursuit.
                         

           You're breaking the speed limit,
           you know. Not to mention several
           other laws, as a well as a few
           other things that are not written
           into law per se, but are accepted
           social practices.

          She builds the glove compartment and antenna into a
          CROSSBOW and ARROW.
                         

           So, uh, how have the last seven
           years been?
                         

           Okay.

          The ROBO-NINJAS LAUGH as she struggles against mysterious

          The two cars are TETHERED TOGETHER as they race through
          the streets, making the chase even more BADASS.
                         

           So. I have a lot of questions.
                         

           Is this really the best time to
           talk?
                         

           Well, so far...
                         

           Fine. Shoot.
                         
          Lucy pulls out a pistol, leans out the window, and

           Why did those ninjas take my mom?
           Why are there ninjas? Are they
           robotic ninjas? Where have you
           been the last seven years? When
           did you gain magical superpowers?
           Why did you change your name to
           Gemini? Sounds pretty foofy if you
           ask me. Also, have you been
           following me around this whole
           time? Because that's pretty weird
           considering last time I saw you
           was when you dumped me for
           absolutely no reason.
                         

           You guys used to date? Nice.
                         

           Hardly.
                         

           Oh try all of 8th grade!

          Lucy BUILDS a barrier between the front and back seats.

                         
                         


           How do you do that?
                         

           By the way, I'm seeing someone
           now, so don't get any ideas.
                         

           I never have any ideas.
                         

                         

           Oh, thank goodness, the police are
           here.
                         
          The cops start to shoot at them.
                         

           Never mind.
                         
          Now the cops are chasing them while they chase Doris!
          Dozens. Blues Brothers meets Freebie and the Bean, only
          when these cars crash, they break into LEGO PIECES!
                         

           You don't get it, do you?
                         

           Get what?
                         

           They're here for the Chosen One.
                         

           The Chosen One? What the heck is
           that? Wait, you mean me?! I keep
           telling everyone- I'm just a
           regular guy!
                         

           Not you. Your mom.
                         

           Oh. Really?
                         

           Ha ha, burn.
                         

           I was sent to get her, but they
           got to her first.

                         
                         

           You're sure I'm not the Chosen
           One?
                         

           Emmet, your mother is the most
           powerful being in the universe.
                         

           But-- how-- she has cankles!
                         

           Don't we all.
                         
          The two cars fly off an OVERPASS and land on a MOVING EL
          TRAIN that goes all through LEGOPOLIS. It's a car chase
          on a moving train... IN 3D!
                         

           She and I belong to an ancient
           brotherhood of MasterBuilders, who
           create from our imaginations, not
           instructions, forced underground
           by evil forces. She has long been
           in hiding to protect you from
           those forces. I was sent to summon
           her, but when I showed up she was
           too busy breaking you out of
           prison.
                         
          This sinks in.
                         

           Okay I did not understand a lot of
           that.
                         

           Just hold the wheel.
                         
          Lucy jumps out the window and goes out onto the tether.
                         


           So. What's happening?
                         
                         

                         
          This is insane. And they are running out of train. Lucy
          gets onto the ninja car. Smashes the window. The ninjas
          beat on her. She tries to take the car apart to build a
          weapon but it's somehow STUCK TOGETHER!

                         
                         

           How... Emmet! Jump!
                         
          At the last possible second, Lucy jumps off the car.
          Emmet jumps out of his car. The ninja car flies off the
          end of the train and through a BUILDING. Nothing happens
          to the Viking car, but Lucy and Emmet's car SMASHES into
          a thousand pieces. They land with a THUD.
                         

           Mom! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
                         

           It didn't break. How?
                         

           She's gone. I can't believe she's
           gone... because she tried to
           protect me...?
                         
          Lucy pulls Emmet behind a DUMPSTER as the police arrive
          at the scene and COVER UP the hole in the wall.
                         

           Send everyone you can out hunting
           for that kid and whoever is trying
           to help him. You hear me?!

           He's wanted... broken or together.
                         
          Lucy and Emmet run away. Larry the Barrista emerges from
          the rubble, unseen by the cops.
                         

           I need a coffee.
                         
          He gets up and walks O.S., right past an open sewer grate
          where Emmet and Lucy once were.
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet and Lucy wade through the sewers.
                         

           Who exactly are these evil forces
           my mom was trying to protect me
           from? And why are the cops in
           league with robot ninjas?
                         

           You have a lot of questions.

                         
                         

           I'm just getting warmed up.
                         

           They all work for the Black
           Falcon.
                         

           The Black Falcon?
                         

           Otherwise known as Rodrigo
           Falcone, the C.E.O. of Empura?
                         

           Empura? I love their stuff.
                         

           He is also the self-declared
           Emperor of all known LEGO realms.
           He kidnapped your mom because she
           is the only one who can stop him
           from destroying us all.
                         

           My mom. My mom?
                         

           Emmet, did your mom have a safe
           deposit box, a safe, something
           where she would have hidden
           something very valuable?
                         

           No. The only thing she had that
           was worth anything was her purse.
           She takes it with her everywhere.
           Unfortunately it's now melted to
           my arm. Ow!
                         
          Lucy yanks the purse towards her. She opens the purse
          and starts removing items. A lot of items. Like A LOT.
                         

           
           No...no...no...no...no...no...
           No...no...no...no...no...no...
                         

           Well, I guess it's not in there--
                         

           No...no...no...no...no...no...

                         
                         
          Finally, it's empty.
                         

           It's not in there.
                         
          Emmet pulls it away. A RATTLE.
                         
          Lucy pulls Emmet back and finds a FALSE COMPARTMENT. In
          it is a lock box. It has a combination lock.
                         

           What's her birthday?
                         

           November twenty-second.
                         
          That's not the combo.
                         

           Of course. Your birthday.
           January six.
                         


           You remember?
                         

           Not by choice.
                         
          Lucy opens the case and lifts out the most beautiful
          thing they've ever seen: a single PIECE that has studs on
          all sides, and continually changes colors as if by magic.
                         

           The MasterPiece.
                         

           What is this thing? It's...
           beautiful.
                         
          They bask in its glow.
                         

           Some say it's the first piece
           ever. No one knows exactly what it
           does, but it is said the Chosen
           One will use it to one day save
           the world.
                         

           And by that you mean my mom.
                         

           There's an inscription.

                         
                         
          There is an inscription. Etched all around it.
                         

           One will come from land afar,
           With hand besmirched in shape of star.
           One to confront a great forsaker,
           And build a bridge to meet the Maker.
           This one will make the world right,
           But first there'll be an awesome fight.
                         

           The prophecy of the Chosen One...
                         

           Who is my Mom.
                         

           Yes. We have to get this to your
           mom so she can fulfill her destiny
           and stop the Black Falcon before
           he destroys us all.
                         

           And if it weren't for me, she'd be
           here and everything would be okay.
                         
          Lucy doesn't say anything. It's her way of saying "Yes."
                         
          Emmet goes up to the MasterPiece, upset. He touches it,
          feeling sorry for himself. The second Emmet touches
          it... WHAM!!!!
                         

                         
                         

                         
          A fuzzy vision of strange creatures. Are they... HUMAN?
          We see them very close up. As though the cameraman were
          a minifig. And he were underwater.
                         

           Finn? I thought I told you not to
           touch anything...

                         

                         
          Emmet lets go, catching his breath. The purse is now
          free from his hand.

                         
                         

           What was that?
                         

           What was what?
                         

                         

           We have to go. NOW.
                         
          COPS enter the sewer. Emmet puts the MasterPiece back in
          his mom's purse and wears it like a backpack. Lucy and
          Emmet dash out.
                         
          A FOOTCHASE ENSUES between the cops and Lucy and Emmet.
          Lucy uses her powers to dash through buildings and shops
          and lose the cops, breaking apart walls and rebuilding
          them behind her. Emmet keeps up, barely.
                         

           Where are we going?!
                         

           We're going to take the MasterPiece
           to someone who can help.
                         

           The MasterBuilders council?
                         

           No. They're gone. All of them.
                         
          She turns away, remembering. It's painful.
                         

           Then who?
                         

           Vitruvius. He was once a great
           MasterBuilder, now he's...retired.
           But he's our only hope.
                         

           Can't you do it on your own? You
           were all like, heh-hoo-hiya!
                         
          Emmet lamely imitates her quickbuild kung-fu.
                         

           I can't, I'm...still in training.
           I'm not a full-fledged
           MasterBuilder yet. Technically,
           I'm an intern.

                         
                         

           Well well well--
                         
          The cops are closing in. They turn around a blind corner
          and run smack into...
                         
                         

                         
          There's a big sign that tells us "CITY LIMITS. NO
          EXIT/NO ENTRY." And a literal line across the ground.
          Emmet stops short of the line.
                         

           You're not going to cross the city
           limits, are you?
                         

           Don't be a putz, Emmet.
                         

           Everyone knows you're not allowed
           to go Out of Town. It's dangerous,
           uncharted and no one should ever go
           that's what everybody says. Can't
           we just explain the situation to
           President Iamnotarobot?
                         

           Iamnotarobot is one of the Black
           Falcon's robot henchmen. Ever
           notice how metallic he looks?
                         

           Come on. He's just very fair
           skinned. It says "Iamnotarobot"
           in his very name! Besides, he's

           Strawman. That guy is the pits.
                         

           Don't be nave.
                         

           What's nave?
                         

           That.
                         
          She steps across the line. Emmet GASPS for a long time.
                         

           Look, just give me the MasterPiece
           and I'll take it from here.

                         
                         

           My mom gave it to me and I'm not
           giving it to anyone unless their
           name is My Mom.
                         

           Well then I guess you're going to
           have to cross that line.
                         

           Well then I guess I am.
                         

           Well then go ahead and do it.
                         

           Well then go ahead and do it I
           shall.
                         
          Beat. We can hear the cops and their DOGS BARKING.
                         

           Dude!
                         

           Okay, okay.
                         
          Emmet deliberately and meaningfully, in super slow
          motion, crosses the line. He EXHALES DRAMATICALLY. Takes
          another step. Then another, then-- SLAM!
                         
          Emmet has walked straight into an INVISIBLE WALL! Camera
          COMES AROUND revealing a trompe l'oeil painting on bricks
          that go up as far as the eye can see.
                         

           Not everything is what it seems...
                         
          Lucy reveals an odd-shaped DEPRESSION in the wall. She
          takes apart a nearby VENDING MACHINE and rearranges the
          pieces into the shape of the depression, puts it in,
          filling the negative space...and it opens a door. Lucy
          pulls Emmet into the door and into...
                         
          A TUNNEL OF LIGHT - just like at the beginning of the
          movie. It seems peaceful, until we see that Emmet and
          Lucy are hurtling towards a monolithic wall. They BLAST
          THROUGH IT and into...
                         
                         

                         
          A beautiful, breathtaking place that looks like LEGO New
          Zealand. It's beautiful. Until...

                         
                         
          Lucy and Emmet crash land into a bunch of HOBBIT HOUSES.
          They get out of the ship and look around. They see a lot
          of hobbits yelling at them for destroying their shire.
                         

           Who are those guys?
                         

           Annoying short whiners. Plus they
           reproduce like crazy. It's a real
           problem.
                         

           Where are we? Where are all the
           buildings? And coffee shops?
                         

           Legopolis is only one realm in the
           Black Falcon's dominion. He built
           walls around all of them so he can
           keep them separate. If the walls
           came down, he'd have a hard time
           controlling the results. The
           MasterBuilders built secret
           passages through the walls so we
           could travel between lands.
                         
          A SCARY NOISE. The Hobbits scurry into their houses.
          Emmet and Lucy get down just before an army of robots
          riding robo-horses marches by.
                         

           Who are they?
                         

           The Black Falcon's sentries.
           They're looking for us.
                         

           So he controls all these worlds?
                         

           Shh!
                         
          A robot turns its head. Almost spots them, then moves
          away. Lucy bonks Emmet on the head and they dash away.
                         
                         

                         
          An evil volcano with a slick office tower rising out of
          it. A big Bauhaus cork holding back inordinate power.

                         
                         

                         
          Doris is strung up in the rubber band, and now also
          chains and strapped to a board.
                         

           The Black Falcon will see you now.
                         
          Guards wheel her into...
                         
                         

                         
          The office of the worst boss you've ever had. Doris
          lunges at him but is restrained by her shackles.
                         

           Doris! Did someone get you a
           water?
                         

           You'll never get away with this.
                         

           "You'll never get away with this!"
           What a clich! You don't even know
           what it is I'm trying to get away
           with. Maybe you should listen
           more.
                         

           I'm all ears.
                         

           Truly? Because listening and
           hearing are not the same thing.
                         

           I'm listening.
                         

           Excellent.

          Doris GASPS as BF unveils the sarcophagus we saw earlier.
          A Robot Ninja opens it. Inside is a TUBE OF KRAZY GLUE
          with some of the letters rubbed off to spell "KRA__GL_E."
                         

           The car in the city. That's why
           it didn't break...

                         
                         

           Very good. But there's a lot more
           to my plan than that. Check it:
                         
          Black Falcon saunters over to a STAGE SET, with a life-
          sized DIORAMA with living minifigs playing out a
          residential tableau.
                         

           Here is your typical family. You
           there. Move your arm a little
           higher. A little higher... NO NO
           NO that's too high!!! Ugh you are
           all PATHETIC LOSERS!
                         
          The Dad puts his arm down slightly.
                         

           Perfect! Wonderful. Don't move an
           inch. You see how hard it is for
           me? I have to make all these plans
           and rules and enforce them on
           people. It's whack-a-mole. I get
           one thing perfect, and then
           another thing gets messed up. Ay
           ay ay I get so tired!
                         

           You never did understand the way
           of the Maker.
                         

           Sure I do. There's one right way
           to do everything, and I know it,
           and everyone else is wrong and is
           trying to screw me up! Until now.
                         
          Some NinjaVikings lower the Kragle into a cool looking

          He points to the operator, who pulls a lever on the

           Exactly how I planned! BAHAHAHA!
           And it's totally permanent!
                         

           You want to do this to the whole
           world?

                         
                         

          So the whole world will be exactly
          how I want.
                         

          But-- I'll never see my son again.
          No mother will ever see her son.
                         

          Unless they're frozen when they
          happen to be looking at each
          other, exactly. Oh Doris, I'm so
          glad we could finally meet again,
          after all these years.
                         

          What do you want from me?
                         

          Isn't it obvious? I want you to
          make me a better Kragle-Thingy!
                         

          That's really dumb.
                         

          I mean this works okay, but it
          doesn't have a wide enough spray.
          I need to make like a big cloud of
          sticky mist. And it's not scary
          enough. And I hate the color.
                         

          You'll never get aw-- You'll not
          achieve that which you have just
          described!
                         

          What, do you think your pathetic
          son is going to save you or
          something? He can't even put two
          bricks together.
                         


          I've trained him. Secretly.
                         

          Did you? I think you protected
          him. Because you were afraid to
          have him live under the spectre of
          being found out. Of being hunted.
          You wanted him to fit in. To feel
          normal, isn't that right?

                         
                         
          Doris can't look at him. BF shows her a poster with a
          goofy image of Emmet. "Wanted: Broken or Together."
                         

           Big mistake, Doris. Thanks to
           that call, he's going to get his
           butt kicked. He'll fit in,
           alright. Into a coffin!
                         

           Leave him out of this!
                         

           I would, but I'm pretty sure he
           has the MasterPiece. It wasn't in
           your apartment, and it's not on
           you. But your son seems to have
           interesting taste in handbags.
                         
          He grabs a LEGO MAGNIFYING GLASS from his desk and shows
          Doris the out-of-focus PURSE Emmet's holding in the
          Wanted photo.
                         

           So, just to tie up all the loose
           ends, I'll have to kill him and
           take the MasterPiece so the
           prophecy will never come true.
                         

           No! Don't, please! I'll do what
           you want, please don't hurt him.
                         

           Oh, don't worry, dear. You'll do
           what I want regardless. I'll
           simply use my very special
           electromagnetic machine to extract
           your thoughts and steal your ideas
           like I've done for all the other
           imprisoned MasterBuilders.
                         

           No!
                         

           Yes. Send her to the THINK TANK!!!

          They come upon a majestic canyon with an immense LEGO
          waterfall . Lucy climbs up
          the rock wall. Emmet follows.
                         

           Is it much farther?
                         

           Do you ever say something that
           isn't a stupid question?
                         

           What's that supposed to mean?
                         

           I guess not.
                         
          Two-thirds up the canyon wall is a ledge with a cave
          behind the waterfall. And a sign. "Beware of Dragon."
          Gulp.
                         
          YAPYAPYAP! DRAGON, a nasty yippy DOG startles them.
                         

           That's Dragon.
                         
          Lucy knocks on the door of a garishly painted SHACK.
                         

           Who could live here?
                         

           A blind man.
                         
          A homeless-looking man opens the door, facing the wrong
          direction. This is VITRUVIUS, Ben Kenobi meets Mr. Magoo
          meets Gandalf meets Columbo.
                         

           Hello! What? Hi!
                         

           I see.
                         
                         

                         
          Looks like it was decorated by a blind man. And it was.
          Vitruvius opens the shades, revealing a window view of a
          rock wall.

                         
                         

           Lovely place.
                         

           Thank you. I am deprived of my
           sight, but my hearing is so acute
           that I can still perceive the
           physical world using echolocation.
                         

           Like an old bat...
                         

           Precisely. I see with my ears.
           Now, how can I help you, extremely
           tall and fat stranger?
                         

           My mother has been kidnapped and
           it's all my fault.
                         

           Mmm...Hard pass. Not interested.
                         

           His mother is the Chosen One. I
           was sent to summon her. The Black
           Falcon got to her first. He has
           the Kragle.
                         
          Vitruvius stops.
                         

           Oh my. That is grave news indeed.
           But I'm afraid I'm retired. I'm
           sure the active MasterBuilders are
           more than adequate.
                         

           The other MasterBuilders are gone.
                         

           I guess I'm not redundant anymore.
                         

           Why is he being so weird?
                         

           The Black Falcon was my student.
                         

                         
          A STYLIZED 2D LEGO FLASHBACK tells his story:

                         
                         

           He was clever and smart. It was
           the age of the MasterBuilders. The
           world was a fluid, creative place.
           The most gifted were enrolled in
           MasterBuilder High School...
                         

           Hey Rod. What's that?
                         

           An awesome secret lair, b'doy!
           It's the best thing I've ever
           built. It's perfect. All I need
           now is a cool nickname.
                         

           I only aimed to teach him a lesson
           about the impermanence of creation.
                         
          LESS OLD VITRUVIUS pulls out a cornerstone brick in the
          lair and the whole thing topples over.
                         

           No! My precious precious work!
                         

           Building is rebuilding, Rodrigo.
           You must learn to embrace the
           practice, not the outcome.
                         

           What a bunch of bunk! That thing
           was AWESOME!
                         
          We see his animated metamorphosis from teen to the Black
          Falcon of today.
                         

           He became enraged. Instead of
           improving his work, it became
           stagnant and weak. He began to
           amass power, and hunt down
           MasterBuilders. Harvesting their
           ideas. Forcing them to write
           instructions for him. Instructions
           that he in turn forced on the
           world. The remaining
           MasterBuilders went into hiding.
           I was encouraged to retire.
                         


                         
                         

           They were probably right.
                         

           You taught my parents...
                         

           Your mother went into hiding to
           protect you. Your father never had
           a chance...
                         

           Vitruvius, you can still help us.
                         

           That's flattery, my dear. We both
           know you're only here because you
           have no other place to go.
                         

           We're here because we don't know
           what to do and you might. Sir, all
           I've ever wanted was to get along
           with everyone and be a part of the
           world and now I don't know if
           there's going to be a world to be
           a part of. That is, unless you
           help me fix it. And I bet if you
           do, they'll forget all about what
           they used to think of you.
                         
          This gets Vitruvius' attention.
                         

           I wish I could, young man, but he
           has the Kragle, and he has the
           Chosen One, and if he has the
           Chosen One, he has the MasterPiece.
           And without that, there is no--
                         

           Hope?
                         
          Lucy holds out the MasterPiece. This changes the game.
          Vitruvius walks reverently towards it. Then past it.
                         
                         

                         
          Vitruvius has created a chart to explain his plan.
                         

           The Kragle is the most powerful
           relic of the Maker.

                         
                         

           Who is this Maker you guys keep
           talking about?
                         
          Emmet and Lucy sit at a "table." AKA a pink ERASER.
                         

           The Maker. The being who put us
           all together and watches over us.
           Only by following the inspiration
           of the Maker can one become a true
           MasterBuilder.
                         

           Okay that sounds super weird.
                         

           It is, but then all the best
           things are.
                         

           And what's the Kragle again?
                         

           Every so often, the Maker drops a
           piece down to us that is unique,
           unlike any other. This crystal
           table is but one example. Some of
           them, in the wrong hands, can be
           weaponized. The Kragle, if
           harnessed, could--
                         

           --destroy the world?
                         

           Yes. The Black Falcon has taken
           your mother, the one person who
           can stop him, and imprisoned her.
                         
          He gestures to a map. For once it's what he says it is,
          but as he's talking, he points to the wrong places.
          Lucky for us, the camera follows the map correctly.
                         

           If we can travel across sea and
           land, penetrate his heavily-
           guarded fortress, unkidnap Master
           Doris, and bring the MasterPiece
           safely to her, she can use it to
           destroy the Kragle, and set the
           world right.

                         
                         

           Oh is that all we have to do? That
           doesn't sound too hard. Oh wait, I
           forgot to mention, I am saying
           this with a sarcastic inflection.
                         

           That's super constructive, thank
           you.
                         

           We need to assemble a team of all
           remaining MasterBuilders hiding
           throughout the lands. We'll scour
           the countryside high and low,
           overturning rocks, hiding from
           sentries, avoiding the major roads
           and air..
                         

           We don't have that kind of time!
                         

           Or we could send out a mass email
           to the MasterBuilders list, and
           have whichever ones are remaining
           meet us at the midpoint.
                         

           Better.
                         

           And then, we sail for the Land of
           Unused Parts!

           Anybody got a ship?
                         
                         

                         
          A bustling colonial-era port, but with every possible
          kind of ship, from aircraft carrier to canoe. Emmet,
          Lucy, Vitruvius, and Dragon sneak down a DOCK disguised
          as FISHERMEN. Dragon is disguised as a FISH.
                         

           How long has your boyfriend had
           his own ship?
                         

           Why do you care?

                         
                         

           I just think it's interesting that
           you're attracted to someone with
           his own vessel. Fairly superficial
           to date a guy with his own yacht.
                         

           It's not exactly a yacht.
                         
          They come upon a really cool PIRATE SHIP. NECKBEARD, a
          pirate, sticks his head through a porthole in the ship.
                         

           Ahoy! Welcome to the Sea Cow!
                         

           Huh. Not what I expected.
                         
          Neckbeard hops out onto the dock, revealing he HAS NO
          BODY. He's just a head. And a beard.
                         

           Really not what I expected.
                         

           Arr! Come give your weary
           boyfriend a kiss!
                         
          She does.
                         

           Wow.
                         
          Neckbeard and Lucy begin MAKING OUT.
                         

           Okay. That's-- okay.
                         

           Gosh, where are my manners?
           Emmet, this is Neckbeard, my
           boyfriend. Neckbeard, this is
           Emmet. We used to date a million
           zillion years ago. It meant
           nothing to me. You have heard of
           Vitruvius, of course.
                         

           You're the teacher that made the
           Black Falcon who he is, then?
                         

           That was a long time ago.

                         
                         

           Farrr be it for a pirate to judge
           a man with an unsavory reputation.
                         

           That's surprisingly gracious--
                         
          Suddenly, Neckbeard somehow gets up in Emmet's grill.
                         

           Stay away from me lady.
                         

           Alright. Sure.
                         

           Say that to my face.
                         

           Alright. Sure.
                         
          He gets somehow closer to Emmet. Mouths almost touching.
                         

           I was once the most feared
           MasterBuilder in all the lands. I
           lost the rest of me body fighting
           off a hundred of the Black Falcon's
           men. You cross me, and I'll make it
           an even fight, if you follow.
                         

           Thank you for your clarity.
                         
          Neckbeard slowly hops back past, eyeing Emmet the whole
          time. Emmet looks to Lucy: "How can you be with him?"
                         

           He has an incredible mind.
                         

           Everyone hop aboard. Meet me crew.
           This be Orangebeard, Brownbeard
           and Nobeard, and me First Mate,
           Chewbacca. You can call him
           Allbeard.
                         
          As they board the ship and meet the ragtag crew including
          Chewbacca, the BAD COP from 20 pages ago watches them
          from the dock, comparing Emmet to his WANTED POSTER.

                         
                         

                         
          The Sea Cow sails across a sea made entirely of LEGO.
          Waves animating with thousands and thousands of LEGO
          bricks-- if the audiences have reassembled their minds
          from being blown before, they just got blown again.
                         
                         

                         
          Neckbeard pores over a chart explaining their heading to
          Lucy and Vitruvius. Emmet swabs the deck.
                         

           The route be stuffed to the gills
           with Empura shipping activity.
           It's heavily patrolled. We'll
           have to be keeping an eye open,
           and when the time be right, make
           ourrrr move.
                         

           What's our move?
                         

           I'm sorry, did the Captain say you

          The boat rocks back and forth. Emmet, LITERALLY GREEN,
          approaches Vitruvius who's MEDITATING while building a
          crazy mecha bird. Like those adorable creatures in
           Batteries Not Included.

           It's Emmet.
                         

           Ah. You got your sea legs, yet?
                         

           Yes. What are you doing?
                         

           Making.
                         

           What's it for?

                         
                         

           What is anything for? It's what
           we were all meant to do. What the
           Maker has fated us to do.
                         

           Okay, here's what I don't get. If
           our lives really are predetermined
           by some all-controlling dude, what
           is the point of doing anything?
                         
          Vitruvius punches Emmet in the face.
                         

           OW! Why did you do that?!
                         

           The Maker fated me to.
                         

           Or you did it yourself because
           you're a crazy person.
                         

           Ah. Now, you're learning.
                         
          Emmet stares at him for a minute, confused. Then he looks
          at the mecha-bird, impressed.
                         

           I could just never make something
           like that. How did you even get
           the idea?
                         

           I didn't. I just opened a window
           for it to fly through.
                         
          Emmet pets the mechabird with a real sense of wonder.
                         

           Birds are, incidentally, one of
           the most creative of all the
           animals. They build nests.
           Create elaborate courtship
           rituals, make gifts for one
           another. And of course, their
           beautiful songs.
                         
          It emits a PIERCING ALARM CLOCK NOISE.
                         

           Teach me.

                         
                         

           Open your throat and make a 
           sound.
                         

           No. Teach me to do what you do.
                         
          Vitruvius smiles. But it's bittersweet.
                         

           How can I teach you something you
           already know? It's already inside
           you. You've walled it up, but it
           still shines through. That
           terrific disaster you caused at
           the instruction site? That was no
           accident.
                         

           I'm not sure I follow...
                         
          Vitruvius points up to the night sky.
                         

           They say every night the Maker
           puts a blanket over the world, a
           blanket with tiny holes. Some call
           them stars, but I call them
           MakerPeepers.
                         

           MakerPeepers?
                         

           MakerPeepers. Emmet, there was a
           time, before you were born, when
           making new things came as
           naturally to everyone as
           breathing. The world was messy and
           wild, and that made it beautiful.
           But then, everything became rigid
           and prefabricated, so everyone
           just stopped thinking of new
           things. Making has been outsourced
           to Empura. The Black Falcon has
           paved over the world that was.
                         
          Vitruvius indicates the sky.
                         

           And yet, somehow, light still
           shines through the cracks.
                         
          The mechabird flies out a porthole. Emmet runs after it.

                         
                         

           Oh no! Wait!

           It got out...
                         

           Isn't that marvelous? You have an
           idea, and then off it goes!
                         
                         

                         
          WE FOLLOW the mechabird soaring over the moonlit waves,
          and finally, past a VIKING SHIP manned by ROBOVIKINGS.
                         
                         

                         
          It's more high-tech than a normal Viking Ship. Lots of
          Empura Logos. Bad Cop stands next to a RoboViking Sentry.
                         

           That's them. Man your weapons.
           Full steam ahead.
                         

           We don't use steam. We row.
                         

           Fine. Full row ahead.
                         
                         

                         
          Neckbeard looks through a SPYGLASS at the enemy ship.
                         

           They're a-comin'! Dive!
                         
          Vitruvius and Emmet come up from below decks. Lucy and
          Neckbeard begin to meditate together.
                         
          We go into LUCY'S MIND'S EYE: She is conceiving of new
          instructions. She can see every piece at once and is
          reforming them in her mind into something new.
          NECKBEARD'S MINDS EYE looks the same. Their two visions
          of the pieces combine!
                         

           What are they doing?
                         

           Collaborating.

                         
                         
          Their eyes open!
                         

           Vitruvius, follow my lead.
                         

           Mateys! Be me hands and legs!
           Start taking the ship apart!
                         
          Neckbeard's pirate crewmembers, including Chewbacca,
          enthusiastically oblige.
                         

           But we'll sink!
                         

           That's the idea.
                         

           Put the four-piece over there.
           No! The skinny one. Come on!
                         

           I don't get it-- What do I do?
                         

           Build a hatch.
                         

           Like for an attic?
                         

           Like for a submarine.
                         
          Lucy, Neckbeard, Vitruvius, all start rebuilding the ship
          into a BADASS SUBMARINE. This looks awesome as hell.
                         
          Emmet, exasperated, does his best to build a hatch.
          INTERCUT the others building quick and cool with Emmet
          unable to act creatively at all. Finally, in SLOW
          MOTION: Emmet puts two bricks together.
                         
          At the last second, Lucy runs up to Emmet. All he's got
          is two pieces attached in a cross-bar.
                         

           That's as far as you got?!
                         

           Well...
                         
          She quick-builds a hatch, attaches his cross-bar, drags
          him inside, and spins the hatch shut, just as they DIVE
          below the waves.

                         
                         

                         
          Like a classic sub interior, but manned by pirates.
          Neckbeard perches himself at the periscope, plugging into
          it using his head peg.
                         

           Heading?
                         

           Arrrrrrrr.
                         

           Get deeper. If we're too high
           their sensorrrs will detect us.
                         
                         

                         
          A ROBOVIKING among SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT sees nothing.
                         

           Nothing? But they were right here.
                         

           Wait. There's something on the
           scanner.
                         
                         

                         
          OVERHEAD SHOT: We watch the sub go underneath the ship.

          PUSH IN as the radar scanner spins around slowly. Will
          it show a blip or not?
                         
                         

                         
          A bunch of RoboVikings stand at the ready, prepared to
          fire extensive weaponry any second.

                         
                         

                         
          UNDER THE SUB LOOKING UP: we can see the carrier far
          overhead in the moonlight, the sub in the foreground.

           Nothing. There's nothing.
                         

           Let me see that... DAMMIT!
                         
          He hits the equipment, breaking some pieces off.
                         

           Hey, watch it man, I built that.
                         
                         

                         
          They did it! Emmet cheers with everyone, excited to be
          one of the guys. Lucy puts a hand on his shoulder. It's
          the first time anyone has really touched him since his
          mom was kidnapped. He smiles and looks out a porthole.
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet looks out at the water. He sees many beautiful
          LEGO fish, dolphins, and whales. It's just WONDEROUS.

           Hey Lucy, you gotta see--
                         
          He sees Lucy and Neckbeard making out again. When we cut
          back to Emmet, he's GREEN again.
                         
                         

                         
          FOG. The sub surfaces. The hatch opens. Emmet runs out
          and WRETCHES into the ocean. Until he looks up to find:

                         
                         
          A TREASURE CHEST floating by. He hauls it onto the deck.
          Opens it to find what you and I would call a KEYRING with
          a LASER POINTER. Emmet touches the ring.
                         

                         
          It's a little clearer now. Imagine human beings but made

           No.
                         

           You sound like you are lying. Are
           you lying?
                         

           No.
                         

           Okay, this is my very special
           area, where I play with something

           anyone, because it is the most

           Because you need money for
           girlfriends. Although they refuse
           to admit that. Although they
           admit it implicitly when they
           leave you for a banker.

          EMMET WAKES UP! He drops the ring in shock. Then he puts
          it in his purse-backpack.
                         
          He looks at the ocean water and watches its composition
          change as RANDOM COLORED PARTS begin to intermingle with
          the water, like the confluence of two rivers. He looks
          out to the horizon and sees he has just entered a SEA OF
          UNUSED PARTS. At its center is an ISLAND covered in fog.

           in the universe.
                         
          Vitruvius is looking the wrong way. Lucy turns him in
          the right direction.
                         

           Thank you.
                         
                         

                         
          It's so creative - different from the other architecture
          we've seen. Our heroes knock on the big wacky door.
                         

           Does the Black Falcon know about
           this place?
                         

           It's been hidden for ages by the
           fog and its remote location. Plus
           they have elaborate security
           measures.

                         
                         
          From the door emerges a silly LEGO face.
                         

           Who goes there?
                         

           Oh, uh, I'm Emmet. This is my ex-
           girlfriend Lucy, also a blind man,
           a pirate head, and a loud dog.
           We're here to save the world.
                         

           Well, I've never heard of you, but
           come on in!
                         
          The door opens.
                         

           That's the security?
                         
          They stroll easily into a FANTASTICAL WONDERLAND...
                         
                         

                         
          It's a cross between The Point, Yellow Submarine, Terry
          Gilliam's sketchbook, and a medieval castle. All manner
          of bizarre creatures roam about. It's like looking into
          a child's brain: wonderous and fluid and nonsensical.
                         
          KRAZY KING KARL, a weird combination of disparate mini-
          figs arrives, riding a DINO-ROCKET.
                         

           Hi! I'm Karl, and Welcome to my
           Krazy Kastle. Krazy with a K!
                         

           For Kreativity...
                         

           Exaktly!
                         

           Why did you build all this stuff?
                         

           Well...Why not?
                         
          MUSIC: An original song called "Why Not?" in which KING
          KARL explains that when your kreativity is truly free,
          anything can happen. Yep, we're doing a Willy Wonka-style
                         


                         
                         
          KING KARL shows them around his krazy kingdom! Each
          wacky environment is packed with Krazy Kreatures.
                         

           If you can conceive it, we will
           achieve it. Build anything
           whenever you feel it.
                         

           You know we really don't have time--
                         

           Invent a game, like Roller
           Cricket. Or buy Bullfighting
           Tennis tickets...
                         
                         

                         
          A bunch of bulls chase tennis players as they hit back
          and forth. They watch from a box as a bull knocks down
          one of the players.
                         

           Just wide!
                         

           This is me favorite sport.
                         

                         
                         

                         
          Filled with nonsensical charts and weird animals
          misspelling basic words on oddly-shaped chalkboards.
                         

           We only teach art and music in
           school so kids feel unencumbered.
           No spelling, reading, science or
           math, we just make up all the
           numbers!
                         
                         

                         
          It looks like an M.C. Escher drawing come to life.
                         

           Make any idea thought or spoken.
           Rules were meant to be broken!

                         
                         

           No, rules were meant to be
           followed.
                         
                         

                         
          Happy artsy citizens and animals and weird morphy rocks
          and trees all gather for a BIG FINALE!
                         

           We have everything and nothing and
           something's all we've got. Why,
           you ask? What you should ask is...
           Why not?!!!!
                         
          The finish. Emmet is pretty overwhelmed.
                         

           You guys are really weird.
                         

           Cool, man, thank you.
                         

           This is crazy. You can't have a
           society without rules. I mean,
           your castle doesn't look very
           structurally sound at all!
                         
          He gestures to the structurally unsound Kastle, which is
          is built on a single swirly stilt and looks like a giant
          teetering Mobius Strip with turrets.
                         

           Who is this guy?
                         

           Emmet. He doesn't get out much.
                         
          Vitruvius pulls a frustrated Emmet aside.
                         

           Emmet, these people are not
           MasterBuilders. They do not create
           with purpose, they create just to
           create. But they can also be very
           inspiring, because the only way to
           accomplish the impossible is to
           break the rules of what is
           possible.
                         

           I wish that made sense to me.

                         
                         

           It will if you let it.
           
           King Karl, I wish we came to you
           with better news.
                         

           As do I. The others arrived just
           before you, which gave us a chance
           to rehearse the song. Follow me.
                         
                         

                         
          The King leads them into a LOTR-style room, with a long
          table filled with a bounty of food.
                         

           Ar! What a bounty! I be starrrving!
                         
          Neckbeard hops onto the table and gorges himself. Also,
          we should mention that everything Neckbeard eats or
          drinks goes right down his throat and onto the floor.
          Yuck. Emmet gives Lucy a look. After a beat:
                         

           Meet your team.
                         
          At the other end of the hall stand BATMAN, a famous
          masked crime-fighter; DUPLO, an old-school Duplo figure;
          and BENNY, a spaceman.
                         

           Hey, I'm Batman. Got the email.
           On my Batphone. Which I invented.
           Gets emails. On a phone.
                         
          He waits for them to be impressed, then steps back.
                         

           Hello.
                         


                         

           And where do you come from?
                         


                         

           Okay. Um, he's a MasterBuilder?

                         
                         

           No. But he wants to help.
                         


                         

           I'm a MasterBuilder. I built a lot
           of gadgets. Want to see my gadgets?
                         

           No thank you.
                         

           I'm also a MasterBuilder.
                         

           Cool!
                         

           I'm Benny. Benny "Blue" Chu. Where
           are you from? I'm from space.
           There's not a lot of oxygen up
           there. One time I was fixing my
           ship in space and there was a
           crack in my helmet. They say I
           should've died or gotten Space
           Madness but I didn't die. I'm
           here, right? Ha ha! Have you seen
           my spaceship? I rebuilt it but it
           doesn't fly for some reason.
                         
          He points out the window to an odd, unstable-looking
          SPACESHIP, which is parked outside.
                         

           Um, maybe if it didn't have two
           fronts and no back, and it didn't
           have five wings.
                         

           I love wings. Wings are great,
           right?
                         

           He seems a little distracted.
                         

           What? Where?
                         

           Is this everyone?

                         
                         

           Oh, no. There's one more. My co-
           pilot Moppy. He's really organized.
                         
          Benny holds a Mop.
                         

           Hi Moppy.

           Hi everybody. Did you meet my
           friend Benny? He's the best.

           That's too nice of you, Mopper.

           He can really help you with your
           quest.

           Well, I don't know.

           He gets real lonely sometimes.

           Moppy!

           It's true. He was all alone in
           space. He tried to look for his
           space friends but couldn't find
           them. No one is left but me. Him.
                         
          BEAT. He looks so sad and lonely.
                         

           What did you say you do again?
                         

           Oh, I'm a Space Cadet. First
           Class.
                         

           Ah.
                         

           We are all that remain of the once
           proud society of MasterBuilders.
           Except for Duplo. And Emmet. He's
           not a MasterBuilder, he's just the
           son of one. And Lucy, who is still
           an intern.
                         


           Hello.

                         
                         

           Along with a blind man, a pirate
           head, a crazy spaceman, and
           Batman...
                         
          Emmet pulls out the MasterPiece. They all marvel at it.
                         

           Together, we form a fellowship of
           the MasterPiece. A shining beacon
           of possibility, and the only thing
           that can counteract the power of
           the Kragle. If we can get this
           into the hands of the Chosen One--
                         

           Freeze!
                         
          REVEAL Bad Cop and his men! Guns trained.
                         

           Or didn't you know that as a
           former student of MasterBuilder
           academy, the Black Falcon was cc'd
           on your mass email?
                         
          He takes the MasterPiece and cuffs everyone else. Behind
          the cops and vikings stands a sheepish King Karl.
                         

           I'm sorry, I had to let them in.
                         

           King Karl! You betrayed us! You
           betrayed everything you stand for!
                         

           Tsk, I know. Turns out Legotopia
           had run up like a bunch of debt.
           Something about lots of spending
           and no revenue. Empura promised
           to fund the whole place.
           Honestly, I'm super sorry.
                         
          They all struggle but the Ninjavikes are too much.
                         

           This guy is supposed to be
           inspiring? More like conspiring...
           with a bunch of mean jerks who
           have my mom! You're just as bad as
           them, you big mean jerk!

                         
                         

           Come on. Guys.
                         
          Everyone looks at him real angry. Karl feels really
          guilty, and watches them get led out at gunpoint.
                         

           Where are you taking them? Not to
           the dungeon, right? You said--
                         

           Do I look like a medieval
           constable? No, they're going
           someplace much worse. Take them
           to... the conference room!
                         
                         

                         
          A medieval, dungeon-like conference room. Outside its
          glass walls, there are fruity creatures walking around.
          Everyone is there but King Karl.
                         

           I have the Black Falcon for you...
                         

           Okay we're good to teleconference.
                         
          He turns on a TELECONFERENCING DEVICE. It doesn't work
          very well. To start, the image is a closeup of BF's neck.
                         

           Well, well, well. Looks like I
           have you right-- All I'm seeing
           is a wall. Should I turn it? You
           turn it. Turn it around. Is this
           the volume? WELL WHICH ONE IS THE

           OH THERE IT GOES! Can you

          Everyone jumps out of their seats. Yow that's loud.
                         

           Just, point the camera at you.

           No, the other way. There. That's
           close enough.
                         

           Oh I see you! I see your hand.
           Wave your hand. Ha ha! This is
           amazing! Do you hear a weird echo
           on your end? I can hear myself but
           like two seconds later. Echo.

          Vitruvius lunges with his staff at the screen.
                         

           No no he's just on teleconference.
                         

           What?
                         

           It's like a phone. A telegram.
           He's not actually in the room.
                         

           Like a crystal ball?
                         

           Sure.
                         

           Still being schooled by your

          This hurts.
                         

           I thought you might want to know
           that my good friend Doris here is
           safe and sound, so you don't have
           anything to worry about.

                         
                         
          He pushes a button, switching cameras to Doris, who is
          tied in a big machine with a tube strapped to her head.
          She looks tired. Some of the life drained out of her.

          the ideas right out of their heads. Including Doris.
                         

           Every MasterBuilder in the world
           is in this tank, having their
           ideas extracted. Now, with the
           ideas of the Chosen One, I can
           finally build the best
           Kraglethingy in the world, freeze
           everything, and make the universe
           exactly how I like it forever.
                         

           Mom! No!
                         

           There's nothing you can do, dude.
           I already have the ideas. My
           builders are putting the finishing
           touches right now. What are you
           going to show up here in the next
           twenty four hours and stop me?
           You just gave me the only hope you

          He gestures to a mini-model of all his lands. It takes
          up substantial floor space.
                         

           These are all the lands I control!
           They are perfect! And they are
           going to be that way forever! Now

          Bad Cop and his support team are marching our guys
          through an underground parking lot. They open a door to
          a squad car, but guess who's inside? King Karl!
                         
          He kicks open the door and smashes Bad Cop's hand in it.
          He does some creative building and kicks everyone's
          butts. He frees our heroes.
                         

           You're a MasterBuilder, too?
                         

           I dabble. You were right. I'd
           rather be poor and free than
           comfortable and stuck.
                         
          They grab the MasterPiece and run away.

          They run up the stairs.
                         
                         

                         
          Sirens. Dozens of cop cars pull up, along with Robo-

          All the whimsical creatures and citizens go steely and

          but an effective ballistic.
                         
          And it's a MASSACRE. The fruity forces of King Karl are
          just no match. Their vehicles don't drive. The bows and
          arrows shoot in curly cues. They are just impossibly
          overmatched. It's an instant rout.

          Benny's demolished ship and the Kastle, put them into the
          catapult and jump inside of it.
                         
          They watch as King Karl tries to trip up Bad Cop, but
          falls to an attack of Skeletons. We watch him fall in
          SLOW MO... It's super sad, you guys.

          Duplo jumps up and just as Bad Cop arrives, STOMPS on the
          other end of the lever, FLINGING our heroes into the air
          along with all the remains of Benny's spaceship.
                         
          IN MID AIR all the MasterBuilders mind-meld and
          quickbuild a ROCKET-COPTER around themselves with the
          remains of the spaceship. Emmet actually helps. He may

           I mean, that day when we were
           kids, and you drew the face in art
           class, you inspired me. I thought
           maybe there was more out there in
           the world, and maybe you felt the
           same. That's why I asked you out.
           But then you ended up like
           everyone else and broke my heart,
           you know? That I was going one way
           and you didn't go with me.
                         

           Think of how I felt. My mom
           trained me to follow the herd. To
           lay low. All I ever wanted was to
           fit in, to have friends. And the
           funny thing is, maybe I was trying
           too hard, but, my whole life, I
           never did have any real friends.
                         

           We're being so dramatic. It was
           eighth grade!
                         

           That's the most dramatic time in
           anyone's life, right? It's what
           made The Black Falcon such a world
           class dingaling.

                         
                         

           It made a lot of us dingalings.
                         

           Yeah.
                         
          Emmet looks away, sad.
                         

           You know, whenever I doubt myself,
           I look into this prism I found
           long ago...
                         
          She pulls out a wadded-up metallic GUM WRAPPER.
                         

           It's... beautiful.
                         

           I know. It's a relic of the Maker.
           When I'm feeling low, I look at
           it, and it always makes me feel
           like there still is beauty in the
           world, and we all have a purpose.
           You know what I mean?
                         
          He stares at it, then at her.
                         

           Yeah. I do.
                         
          A long beat as they look at each other...
                         

           Well, good night.
                         

           Yeah. Okay.
                         
          Emmet sits alone, looking at his sparkly reflection in
          the gum wrapper. As he puts his hands on it:
                         
                         

                         


                         

           Finn? What did you do to the
           spaceship? It's in pieces! I
           told you not to play with this and
           you broke it! It took me years to
           build all this!


                         

           And what's it doing in the Old
           West Town? And is that Batman? It
           doesn't belong here!
                         

           I'm sorry, Uncle Ted. I just
           wanted to play.
                         

           Well, life isn't all play.
           Sometimes it's serious and it gets
           screwed up and you don't feel like
           playing. You just wish for once
           everything was in the right place.
                         


           Okay.
                         
          Finn goes off. Ted picks up a tube of Krazy Glue.
                         

                         
          Emmet looks at the gum wrapper. Confused, he puts the
          wrapper in his purse/backpack. He is startled by:
                         

           I don't suppose this is the
           restroom?
                         

           No. Definitely not.
           
           Hey, Can I ask you something? I
           keep having these strange dreams
           about a squishy bumpy giant--
                         
          Vitruvius stops.
                         

           Visions of the Maker. Quite
           unusual.
                         

           What does it mean? Do I have a
           fate?
                         

           We all have a fate. But
           MasterBuilding is about channeling
           the power of the Maker, and taking
           that fate into our own hands. I
           guess it could mean what you
           choose to make it mean.

                         
                         

           Why do you always talk in weird
           riddles? I just want answers.
                         

           Then why don't you try building
           something for yourself?
                         
          Emmet builds himself a little mecha-bird, like the one
          that Vitruvius made earlier. It's adorable.
                         

           I'm sorry, that's lame.
                         


           That's lame. That's lame.
                         
          The bird flies off a few feet and CRASHES into a tree,
          losing some pieces, then flies off all wobbly.
                         

           Not bad. You're learning now.
                         

           No I'm not. I'm just copying what
           you did.
                         

           A dilettante borrows. A true
           artist steals.
                         
          He pats him on the head and walks away. After a beat:
                         

           That makes no sense!
                         

           And all this does?
                         
                         

                         
          Morning is not much different from night at this dark
          place.
                         
          HELICOPTER SHOT: Our heroes hike over a hill.
                         
          At the crest they stop in awe at EMPURA TOWER, rising
          from the volcano like a midcentury cork.
                         

           How the heck are we going to do
           this?

                         
                         

           It's okay. I have a plan.
                         

           Really?
                         

           This R2 unit had the plans for
           Empura Tower stored in its memory
           bank.
                         

           That's convenient.
                         
          R2D2 projects the blueprints for the fortress.
                         

           Looking over it last night, I
           noticed the tower follows the same
           construction principles as the
           condos I was building back in
           Legopolis.
                         
          BEGIN OCEAN'S 11-STYLE PLAN SEQUENCE, in which we see the
          things actually happening as they are described!
                         

           We enter through the base here.
           Batman, you'll take out all the
           guards, while the rest of us
           change into their uniforms, and,
           posing as the new guards,
           determine my mother's location.
           What about a passkey, you ask? We
           won't need a passkey or whatever
           security code they have because
           we'll sneak up the elevator shaft
           by building our own elevator,
           which we then take all the way to--
                         
          SMASH! The elevator is destroyed by a descending
          elevator.

           We put the guards to sleep with
           gas. Then build a kickass window-
           washing apparatus, which,
           unbeknownst to the baddies, will
           have all kinds of cool weapons
           inside and...

           its own weight...
                         
          SMASH! The window washing apparatus falls and crashes.
                         

                         

           Darn.

           We build a second tower right next
           to the first. The whole thing
           will be an optical illusion,
           matching exactly the visual of the
           landscape behind the tower. I'll
           be the foreman, and--
                         
          CRASH! Because Vitruvius was the foreman, the whole
          tower falls down.
                         

                         

           What, is it because I'm blind?

           I'll take out all the guards with
           a batarang. Then we'll bust down
           the front door with a battering
           batram, look around corners with a
           batperiscope. Then I'll batcharm
           my way into the lair, and the
           Joker will be there.


                         

           I'll be locked in a deep struggle
           with him that isn't just physical
           but psychological. We'll talk
           about how he killed my parents,
           depending on who you talk to, and
           how his physical disfigurement and
           my emotional disfigurement are two
           sides of the same coin. And then
           Robin will be like "Can I help"
           and we'll both be like "NO!" And

           conference room filled with toys
           and funny posters, and discuss the
           plan in a group. We'll have rules
           of play, such as 'Yes and,' not
           `No, but' so we can keep criticism
           constructive and keep the process
           moving forward, and slowly over
           many iterations of the process
           we'll add the best thoughts from
           everyone until we have a plan
           that's more robust and creative

           He'll get a flipping massage
           alright.
                         

           Language! There are kids here.
                         

           Who are these nerds?
                         
          It's the diorama family from earlier. Still frozen. The
          family members are separated, unable to touch.
                         

           We, uh, can't move.
                         
          Lucy tries to lift the daughter but she's stuck to her
          chair which is stuck to the floor.
                         

           They won't budge.
                         

           The bad guy is going to freeze
           everyone.
                         

           Kids? Are you okay?
                         

           They're alright, baby.
                         

           I miss you, mom.

                         
                         
          Emmet's heart breaks.
                         

           Me too.

           This is really sad. How can you
           keep living like this?
                         

           Well, yeah, we can't be together.
           We can't touch or see each other.
           But in here-- and if I could, I'd
           be pointing to my head-- I'm not
           stuck. In my brain we're sharing
           a delicious meal together.
                         

           Thank you sweetie.
                         

           Pass the mustard.
                         
          They all play along.
                         

           That's pretty elaborate.
                         

           They can freeze you. They can tell
           you what to do. But they can't
           stop our secret weapon. Ideas.

           Now go give `em hell.
                         
          Lucy starts to exit.
                         

           Wait. Batman, give me your
           Batperiscope.
                         
          Emmet grabs some nearby tubes and goes to work. He's not
          a quickbuilder, he's more methodical. What's he up to?
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet places a FOUR-WAY PERISCOPE in front of their
          faces.
                         

           Now at least you can see each
           other.

                         
                         
          They smile at one another. Emmet smiles. Lucy looks at
          him. That's the guy she used to love.
                         
                         

                         
          The Black Falcon stomps down the hallway. People tremble
          in his wake. A flank of baddies stops and salutes.
                         

           You there. Listen to me.
                         
          REVEAL it's not the The Black Falcon at all, but rather,
          Neckbeard's head on top of a black-Sharpied R2D2.
                         

           You have grown a beard.
                         

           I be trying it out. What do ye
           think?
                         

           It's very nice.
                         

           Thank you. Arr.
                         

           Is there something in your throat,
           sir?
                         

           Yes. It be a new throat something
           I'm trying out. Do ye like it?
                         

           Very much.
                         

           Say, I beed wondering if you could
           do me a favor.
                         

           At your service, commander.
                         

           Take off your ninja clothes.
                         

           Sir?
                         

           I be the boss, ain't I be?

                         
                         

           Yes, sir.
                         
          They do as instructed. Into their skivvies.
                         

           Now pull each other's heads off
           and kick them way down the hallway
           where you can't see them anymore.
                         

           Yes, sir-- ow!
                         

           Very good. Now count to one
           thousand.
                         

           
           Yes sir.
                         
          Suddenly our heroes jump out from the shadows and put on
          the ninja clothes.
                         

           This be awesome.
                         
                         

                         
          Guards hear the door open and stand at attention. In
          walk NECKBEARD and the GANG, all dressed up as ninjas.
                         
          They stare up at the THINK TANK. All kinds of
          MasterBuilders hooked up to tubes. Awful. You can't
          help but be upset at the inhumanity of the whole thing.
                         

           Black Falcon? You're supposed to
           be at your massage.
                         

           I uh...
                         
          Neckbeard's head falls off R2D2. FIGHT! Our guys kick
          the crap out of the guards, who try and fail to sound an
          alarm. It's a bar brawl, and Batman really shines.
                         
          Emmet rushes up into the Think Tank and finds his MOM.
          Everything else slows down. The sounds of the fighting
          fall away. He's so glad to see her. Wouldn't you be?
                         

           Mom...

                         
                         

           What? Emmet?
                         

           It's me, Mom. I've here to save
           you, so you can save the world.
                         
          He pulls out the MASTERPIECE.
                         

           I don't think she'll be doing
           that.
                         
          The Black Falcon has entered, flanked by Bad Cop and a
          legion of robo-soldiers!
                         

           Rodrigo Falcone. My old student.
           It's time you went back to SCHOOL!


                         
          Our heroes make a break for the exit, as Vitruvius
          squares off with the Black Falcon. Vitruvius spins, grabs
          some pieces of the Think Tank and uses his staff to guide
          an ELECTRICAL BOLT at him. The Black Falcon deflects.
                         

           The old dog still has a few
           tricks. But I guess your friends
           didn't tell you that I was flanked
           by like a hundred soldiers. Now!
                         
          RoboNinjas fling a RUBBER BAND from a PAPERCLIP (like
          when they got Doris in Act I) and it binds him instantly.
                         

           Get the rest of them!
                         
                         

                         
          Our heroes book it. Emmet helps Doris.
                         

           Why won't anything in this hallway
           break off?!
                         

           It's Kragle-frozen! Batcrap!
                         
          Reveal Bad Cop and the RoboNinjas closing in on them.

                         
                         

           Lucy.
                         

           Yes?
                         

           I want you to know, I love you.
                         

           Me too...
                         

           And even if the world be ending,
           and we all get frozen, I'd feel
           better about the whole situation
           if I could get frozen with you as
           my bride.
                         

           Are you really doing this?
                         

           Lucy. Will you take me hand in
           marriage? Metaphorically.
                         
          Lucy stops, frozen...with INDECISION! She looks at
          Emmet. Emmet smiles bravely at her as he runs.
                         

           Um...
                         
                         
          Lucy's indecision made her fall behind and a RUBBER BAND
          flings and wraps her up! Neckbeard tries to change
          direction but winds up rolling down the hall.
                         

           Lucy!
                         
          Bad Cop et al reload.
                         

           Mom! Hurry!
                         
          Fling! Doris is wrapped up.
                         

           No!
                         
          Fling! Emmet is wrapped up, with the MasterPiece still in
          his hands.

                         
                         

           No!
                         
          Neckbeard tries to go back and rescue them, but Batman
          grabs his head. Well, all of him, really.
                         

           We can't win this. We've got to
           hide and make a new plan.
                         

           
           Arrr!
                         
          Batman, Benny, Neckbeard and R2D2 run around the corner.
          Bad Cop has rounded up Lucy, Emmet, and Doris.
                         


           Take these perps to the Black
           Falcon's office. The rest of you,
           follow me. Looks like we'll be
           playing a little game of hide and
           seek.
                         
          He puts on his LEGO sunglasses, tough cop-style.
                         
                         

                         
          Now Emmet, Doris, Lucy and Vitruvius are all tied up in a
          row facing the window. The Black Falcon inspects his
          prisoners.
                         

           Aw how cute. Mother and son...
           together at last. And what's this?
                         
          He takes the MasterPiece out of Emmet's hands.
                         

           I've been looking for a
           paperweight.

           Did you really think you were
           going to come up here and save the
           day? You're a follower, my
           friend. You don't have the stuff.

           And you. You must be real proud
           of this one, huh? He's a credit
           to the family. Just like his
           talentless father.

                         
                         
          This stings. He is not nice.
                         

           Mom, I'm so sorry.
                         

           I know sweetie.
                         

           Just- tell me everything's going
           to be okay.
                         

           I wish I could, son.
                         

           Mom... Why didn't you -- why
           didn't you teach me what you knew?
                         

           I wanted you to be safe. I thought
           you would be happier. When I saw
           you with that funny drawing, it
           was so marvelous. And then I
           thought of what your life would
           be, how everyone would treat you.
           I just couldn't let that happen.
                         

           I know you're the Chosen One, but--
           I just wish you had let me choose
           for myself.
                         
          Ouch. Doris feels awful. The fighting's stopped.
                         

           I...I don't know what to say.
                         

           You guys want to see it? Let me
           take you up to the construction
           site! Things are about to get a
           little sticky down here.
                         
          He pushes a big red button and the ground begins to
          shake. The Black Falcon smiles.
                         
                         

                         
          The tower begins transforming. Wings come out. Rockets
          fire, and the volcano ERUPTS! The tower BLASTS OFF like
          a rocketship with thunderous power. It climbs high into
          the air and SMASHES THROUGH THE LEGO SKY!

                         
                         

                         
          They stare agape out of the picture window as the world
          falls away. They are now in...
                         
                         

                         
          When we look below, we see all the lands we have visited,
          each walled silos apart from one another. Like the
          neurons in Emmet's brain at the start of the movie.

          made out of millions of smaller LEGO bricks. The tower
          docks with it, a perfect tetris piece that makes it
          finally whole. This is the SpaceStation SUPERBRICK.
                         
                         

                         
          Inside it's an enormous indoor INSTRUCTION SITE filled
          with instruction workers working on something big. The
          Black Falcon's office penthouse is one of the top pegs,
          looking over everything like a control tower. Emmet
          notices his instruction worker pals from Act I.
                         

           They got promoted...
                         

           Behold: The SuperKragleThingy
           Part II.
                         
          Reveal a huge ROBOTIC MONSTER, a hundred men tall, like a
          mechanical Godzilla-raptor. It has a name plate reading
          "Brought to you by Empura".
                         

           It's my best work.
                         

           But you didn't do anything.
                         

           Are you kidding? You think the
           MasterBuilders just up and forced
           themselves to think of this? Did
           those guys force themselves to
           build it? No. I did. Ergo, it's
           mine.

           Look down there.

                         
                         
          The Black Falcon looks down upon all his dominions,
          separated by walls, like LEGO sets lined up together.
                         

           Magnificent, isn't it? And now it
           will be just the way I want.
                         
          A worker puts the last piece on. Another flips a switch.
          The SuperKragleThingy Part II  lights up!

          They watch below as HUNDREDS of Bad guys in helmets
          stream into HUNDREDS of cockpits all over the SKT2. They
          put in ignition keys in unison. The SKT2 thunders to
          life as the hangar door opens and it rockets out of the
          Superbrick...
                         
                         


                         
          Hiding inside a supply closet, watching through a crack,

          for them.
                         

           That does not look good.
                         

           When do we get to the part about
           coming up with a plan?
                         

           I've got a plan.
                         

           Uh-oh.
                         
          He points across the hangar: There are a bunch of
          spaceships.
                         

           What about Lucy and the others?
                         

           We'll come back for them. After we
           stop that Kragle.
                         
          He's right. They make a break for it, as the huge hangar
          door starts closing. They run up to a black spaceship.

                         
                         

           Can we go in the blue one?
                         
          Bad Cop spots them, flanked by RoboNinjas.
                         

           There they are!
                         
          Bad Cop and the RoboNinjas run after them.
                         

           What does it matter?
                         

           I fly better in blue.
                         
          They run over to the blue spaceship and pile in just in
          time to BLAST OFF just as the hangar door closes!
                         

           No! Re-open the door! Everyone in
           ships! Go!
                         

           Dude, you don't have to yell.
                         
          The RoboNinjas pop off their ninja veils and pop on space
          helmets, climb in the remaining ships and take off!
                         
                         

                         
          The SKT2 lands with an earth-shattering THOOM! Animals
          scurry! It's the most impressive thing in the universe.
                         
                         

                         
          BF's Executive Window has become a huge monitor. The
          Black Falcon watches SKT2 on it and barks orders into a
          microphone.
                         

           Left. Right. Straight. Now
           stand up super tall and scary!
                         
                         

                         
          The operators of the SKT2 follow his every command, until
          it stops at a tiny house. A hobbit comes out, pissed.
                         

           Every time!--

                         
                         
          The hobbit's jaw drops as he looks up and takes in the
          sight of the SKT2 belching a fine mist of glue all over
          him and the rest of the hobbit huts. He freezes!

          The SKT2 LAUGHS the same way, then belches glue-mist over
          the entire land. Leaping deer freeze mid-leap. The
          waterfall stops mid-flow. When it's done, the SKT2 LEAPS
          into the air like the Hulk, landing in...
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet's house. SMASH! The SKT2's foot smashes down.
          Pan up to show it about to freeze Emmet's hometown.
                         
                         

                         
          Strapped in rubber bands, all our heroes can do is watch
          the horror on the monitors. Doris turns away.
                         

           It's too horrible to bear.
                         

           What is? Describe it to me. I
           feel really really left out!
                         

           The world is ending.
                         
          Emmet looks around, and eyes the MasterPiece, sitting on
          the console as a paperweight. Next to it is the
          MAGNIFYING GLASS on the Black Falcon's desk that he used
          like 70 pages ago. Emmet gets an idea.
                         
                         

                         
          Benny flies in crazy curly-cues as he avoids Bad Cop's
          army of bad guy spaceships! He also jettisons small
          pieces along the way.

                         
                         

           Go down to the city! What are you
           doing?
                         

           Calling for help from my space
           friends!
                         
          WIDE, we see the jettisoned pieces have formed
          skywriting: S.O.S.
                         

           What, a bunch of mops? There be no
           space friends! Just go!
                         

           Alright, you don't have to be mean
           about it.
                         
          He heads for the city way down below.

          Larry, the Barrista, steps out and does a full-on Laura
          Dern holy-flip-it's-a-dinosaur jaw drop. The SKT2 stomps
          around belching.
                         

           &lt; SIGH &gt; Of course.
                         

           What the heck is happening?
                         

           I think a big dinobot is freezing
           everything with mucusy sneezes.
                         

           So we're doomed? What do we do?
                         

           I don't know. Complain?
                         
          The crazy MECHA-BIRD that Emmet built lands nearby.
                         

           I mean, it's not like we can do
           anything.

           do anything!
                         
          The mechabird lands on the other barrista.
                         

           How annoying.
                         

           Wait a minute...
                         
          WE ZOOM INTO LARRY'S BRAIN! The same thing that happened
          to Emmet. Synapses fire. He gets.... An IDEA!
                         
          Larry puts two pieces together. The 2001 theme plays...
          ...in our heads, but not in the actual soundtrack,
          because that would be super clich.
                         

           What are you doing?
                         

           I don't know exactly. I'm just
           going with it.
                         
          His friend follows suit. This catches on, and the
          citizens of Legopolis start to build all kinds of crazy
          MECHA-BIRDS! Larry's is the most fanciful.
                         

           Larry. My goodness.
                         
          The birds take off and start to flock together. They fly
          up and get in the way of the robot's eyeline.

           see!

           No offense.

           Who the heck did that?
                         
          The remote camera focuses on Larry the Barrista.
                         

           That guy?!

                         
                         

           Hey! Guys! Swipe! Swipe! No!

           This is a disaster!
                         
          While the Black Falcon is distracted, Emmet slowly hops
          over to the desk and bumps it, jostling the magnifying
          glass half over the edge of the desk. He shimmies under
          it. The magnifying glass lens concentrates the light and
          starts to BURN away the rubber band binding him up.
                         

           Do I smell something burning? It
           smells like a tire fire in here.
                         


           Excuse me.
                         
          The Black Falcon goes back to barking orders. Meanwhile,
          the rubber band is almost burned through. Emmet struggles
          to move himself closer and BURNS his hand.
                         


           Ow!
                         
          And he's free! Yes! Behind BF's back, he frees his mom
          and hands her the MasterPiece.
                         


           Mom. Go. Do whatever you're
           supposed to do!

           tired...
                         
          Doris is super out of it.
                         

           She's too weak. You have to do it.
                         

           Do what? What can I do?

           I believe in you, Emmet. I was
           mad because you disappointed me
           for a while, but since it wasn't
           your fault, I'm willing to give
           you a mulligan on it.
                         

           A what?
                         

           A mulligan. It's from golf.
                         

           You play golf?
                         

           The point is, you've spent your
           whole life wanting to fit in and
           have friends, by pretending to be
           something you're not. But now that
           you've let the real you shine
           through, you've made some friends
           who like you for who you are. And
           even if they're just a crazy
           spaceman and a pirate head and a
           blind man and an intern--
                         

           You like me?
                         

           I do.
                         

           Neckbeard likes me?
                         

           ...Sure.
                         

           But... I'm not the Chosen One.
                         

           You wanted to make your own
           choices, right? So choose
           yourself.
                         
          Emmet looks down on it. Then down on his arm. The BURN
          MARK from just a minute a go is in the shape of a STAR.
                         

           Nuh uh.

                         
                         
          Emmet's eyes roll back. He can suddenly "see" the
          pieces, like we've seen other MasterBuilders do. But in a
          way that's even cooler than how they did. He smiles.
                         
          The Black Falcon turns around, finally noticing.
                         

           Wait, what's going on?! What the
           hell are you smiling about?!
                         

           This.
                         
          He uses the MasterPiece, the loose pieces on the desk,
          and the Maker relics he'd been collecting the whole movie
          to build something strange. It's a large circle with the
          laser pointer bouncing off the reflecting gum wrapper
          with the MasterPiece on top, forming a badass looking

                         

           What is it, Emmet?
                         

           I don't know. It just came to me.
                         

           You have channeled the Maker and
           chosen your fate. You have chosen
           to be the Chosen One.
                         

           You are going to defeat me by
           making some kind of art? Ha ha
           ha! Oh let me put on my Pink
           Floyd album so I can totally zone
           out! Ha ha ha this is so lame!
                         
          Emmet slowly walks towards it, and light from the portal
          swells, enveloping Emmet completely. He DISAPPEARS! And
          the portal with it!
                         

           Whoa. That was weird.
                         
                         

                         
          The SKT2 is swatting away birds and staggering around.
                         

           
           Crush them! Stomp on them before
           they get any more ideas!

                         
                         
          The SKT2 lifts a giant mecha-leg above a crowd of
          barristas and cityfolk, who run in panic under the huge
          shadow, about to be crushed, when...
                         

           What the heck is that?!
                         
          In comes Benny, Neckbeard and Batman in their spaceship!
          It shoots at the SKT2's foot, and it pulls its foot away!
          Yeah! But their little pea-shooter can do little damage
          to this Goliath overall.
                         

           Wow, that thing is really big.
                         

           Uh, Benny...
                         
          Hot on their tail is Bad Cop and the other spaceships,
          who pursue Benny's ship through the skyscrapers all
          around LEGOPOLIS!
                         


                         
                         

                         
          The Black Falcon rocks the mic.
                         

           Get that spaceship out of there! I
           don't want to freeze space stuff
           in the city--OOF!
                         
          Vitruvius just suckerpunched him! The Black Falcon
          stares at Vitruvius, Lucy, and Doris, ready to fight.
                         
          Beat, then: The Black Falcon runs away! He opens his
          closet door, pulls an ESCAPE HATCH, and shoots off.
                         

           What do we do?
                         

           Go after him.
                         
          They grab parts around the office and quickbuild their
          own spaceship out of a desk and whatever they can find.

                         
                         

                         
          The sky battle continues as the Black Falcon zooms down
          to the city, docks his ESCAPE HATCH SPACESHIP into the
          central cockpit of the SKT2, and assumes command.
                         

           If you want to get something done,
           you have to do it yourself!!!
                         
          He pushes a button marked "TURBO" and sends a nuclear
          bomb of Kragle Belch out of the SKT2's mouth.
                         

           Quick, everyone! Run behind it!
           Get away from the mist!
                         
          The army of citizens runs as fast as it can towards the
          SKT2 to avoid getting in the line of glue, but the Kragle
          blast arrives, and many of them are FROZEN!
                         

                         
          - A person is about to vote. FROZEN!
                         
          - Two teens with braces are about to have their first
          kiss on the prom dance floor. FROZEN!
                         
          - A baby is delivered to his father.
                         

           It's a b--
                         

                         
          - A street performer pretending to be a robot FREEZES!
                         
                         

                         
          Surrounded by laserbeams, Emmet is levitated through the
          universe. He is split into pieces - like he is becoming
          one with the fabric of the universe. He is traveling
          between the seams. Eventually rising straight towards
          the brightest star in the sky.
                         
          The closer we get, we realize that it is not a star at
          all, but a HOLE in the fabric of the universe. A hole
          just barely big enough for Emmet to fit through. Well,
          not quite big enough. He is stuck.

                         
                         

                         
          Emmet finally wiggles through a hole in a black piece of
          FELT FABRIC. He rubs his eyes and sees an entire human-
          sized basement in a LIVE ACTION WORLD. It's like nothing
          Emmet has ever seen before.
                         
          He marvels at a coffee cup with pencils in it. Stares at
          his reflection in a snowglobe.
                         

           So...not square.
                         
          Something catches his eye. He turns around and sees
                         
          AN ENTIRE LEGO UNIVERSE laid out below. It's a more
          mundane version of Emmet's world: the lands are not as
          vast, towers not as tall, but it's all there:
          representations of the city, waterfall, space cube, etc.
          Each area separated by walls - backdrops laid down by a
          collector. It's pretty much the coolest collection of
          LEGO sets anyone could ever hope to build.
                         
          He looks at his feet and sees tons of loose LEGO parts.
          He realizes he's standing in the middle of a bin of
          LEFTOVER LEGO pieces.
                         

           The Maker. It's all real...
                         
          He looks up to see TED, a human being, staring at him.


                         
          Emmet runs! Ted tries to brush Emmet away, causing a pen
          knife to fall on Ted's hand.

          It just tried to kill me! It just tried to kill me!
                         

                         
          - Emmet grabs a cocktail toothpick and parries Ted's
          flyswatter.
                         
          - Emmet jumps on Ted and Ted tries to get him off. Emmet
          clings to Ted's Ear, screaming into it.
                         
          - Emmet punches Ted in the face while Ted swings and
          misses Emmet because he is so small.
                         

           What the heck are you?!

                         
                         

           What the heck are you?!
                         

           I'm a person.
                         

           I'm a person. You on the other
           hand are a giant squishy beast.
                         

           You're a talking toy. This is
           considerably less cute than I have
           been led to believe.
                         
          Ted touches Emmet's face. Emmet touches Ted's face.
          They do a version of the mirror bit from Duck Soup.
                         

           So ugly...
                         
          Emmet puts his hand up Ted's nose.
                         

           What are these?!
                         
          Ted sneezes all over Emmet.
                         


                         

           Calm down! Where did you come
           from?
                         
          Emmet looks back towards the LEGO set. It's all messed
          up from the fighting.
                         

           Did you build that?
                         

           Yeah, but it's seriously messed
           up.
                         

           Are you the Maker?
                         

           The what?


                         
          Finn comes bounding downstairs.

                         
                         

           What?
                         
          Finn stops in his tracks.
                         

           Are you seeing this?
                         

           Yeah.
                         

           Two Makers?
                         

           How did this-- what is-- my sets,

                         

           The guys. They needed my help.
                         

           Against what?
                         

           Against the Kragle.
                         

           The what?
                         

           The Kragle. The thing that is
           freezing everything together.
                         

           Oh. Krazy Glue?
                         
          He gestures to a big box of Krazy Glue tubes. Emmet
          GASPS in horror.
                         

           Good Lord.
                         

           What? I'm using this to glue my
           set together. So it won't get
           messed up by the kid.
                         

           But then-- it can never change.
                         

           Exactly. It's the only thing in
           my life that's perfect.


                         

           I can't find a job that doesn't
           make me hate myself. My
           girlfriend dumped me for a rich
           trustafarian... dingaling, is what
           he is, and I'm watching my
           sister's kid while she has a fun
           time partying in the Hamptons with
           her annoying brood of hot
           girlfriends who won't have a thing
           to do with me, and the only thing
           I have in my life that makes any
           sense, that I have any control
           over is that perfect world right
           there.
                         

           But... nothing is perfect unless
           it can change. You can make
           something, you know, and it can be
           great, for a while, but then...
           then someone maybe adds to it,
           makes something new out of it. And
           that keeps happening until it
           becomes something that a single
           person could never envision. Truth
           is, creating alone is never as
           good as creating with others.
                         

           See. No. That's not true-
           because with others, they don't
           see things the same way, so--
                         

           I know. You want to control
           everything. I get it. But if you
           succeed, in the end, all you'll
           ever have is what you've got.
                         

           What else could I have?
                         

           Who knows? That's the best part.
                         
          Ted looks at Finn. Then at Emmet. Then at his glue. He
          gets something and hands it to Emmet. It's a GLUE CAP.
                         

           Use this.
                         

           What is it?

                         
                         

           What is it? It's the ca--
                         

           Cone of Power. It's called the
           Cone of Power.
                         

           Okay. The Cone of Power.
                         

           Put it on the Kragle to stop it.
                         

           Yeah. Try that.
                         

           Thank you. It was nice to meet
           you both, disgusting squishy giant
           Maker creature and smaller,
           messier giant Maker creature.
                         

           Nice to meet you.
                         

           I should go save the world now.
                         
          Emmet turns and goes back through the makerpeeper hole,
          back through the portal. Ted picks up a bottle of Krazy
          Glue-dissolving MINERAL SPIRITS and turns to Finn.
                         

           Let's play.
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet careens through the laser tunnel towards LEGOPOLIS.
          Like a meteor reentering the Earth's atmosphere.
                         
                         

                         
          Emmet hits the ground, making a LEGO crater. He raises
          the Cone of Power and dashes toward the SKT2.
                         

           Detach and mobilize! Stop that
           loser!
                         
          Remember how I said there were hundreds of baddies in
          LEGO COCKPITS all over the SKT2?

                         
                         
          Well, those guys jump out and form a ground army of ROBO-
          VIKINGS and SKELETONS and such! Emmet charges for them,
          seriously outmanned.
                         
          Leading the charge is Bad Cop in his Police-Spaceship.
          He has Emmet in his sights... He closes in, firing his
          blasters, when he looks up for a minute to see...
                         

           Hello!
                         
          Benny's ship, headed straight for him! Benny, Neckbeard,
          Batman and R2D2 dive out just before their ship CRASHES
          into Bad Cop's, BREAKING HIM AND HIS SHIP TO PIECES!
          Benny et al land safely, right next to Emmet.
                         

           Thanks for dropping in.
                         

           I hope we're not imposing.
                         
          Emmet and the gang quickbuild-fight against the army.
          Neckbeard headbutts a row of skeletons- they fall like
          dominoes. Batman uses his Batarang to pop off the heads
          of a row of Robo-Vikings. But the badguy spaceships are
          still circling and shooting.
                         

           There's too many of them!
                         

           They're coming at us from all
           sides!
                         

           Guy! Look up! My space friends!
           They got my message!
                         
          A FLEET OF SPACESHIPS arrives, filled with assorted
          characters. For example, Harry Potter and Indiana Jones
          and Han Solo are all in the Millennium Falcon.
                         

           Anything for you, Benny!
                         


           Hey, you look familiar.
                         
          Also, there is a spaceship driven by a bunch of MOPS.
                         
          Lucy, Doris and Vitruvius are in their office desk-shaped
          spaceship. Neckbeard shouts up from below!

                         
                         

           Lucy!
                         

           Neckbeard! We need to talk...
                         

                         
          Looking at the the desk ship.
                         

           I could build such a better ship
           than that.
                         

           Why don't we?
                         
          They do! Other people looking around follow suit, but in
          their own unique way. They all shoot off, until
          collectively, they have formed an ARMADA OF SILLY SHIPS!
                         
          Even King Karl flies in on his dino-rocket and joins the
          air battle as the land battle wages on.
                         

                         
          Amid the massive battle on air and land, Emmet makes his
          way through the armies to the SuperKragleThingy2...
                         

                         
          Inside the SKT2.
                         

           Didn't your mom tell you? She
           designed this thing with a missile
           launcher!
                         
          He flips a switch and the SKT2 extends a mecha-arm,
          launching a huge MISSILE right towards Emmet!
                         
                         

                         
          Amidst the air battle, Doris looks out the window to see
          Emmet on the ground, about to be hit by the missile.
                         

           Emmet!
                         
          She steels herself. Gets some of her energy back.
                         

           Doris, are you okay back there?

                         
                         
          But Doris is gone. She's free-falling to the ground.
                         

           Doris?! Why did she do that?
                         

           The connection between a mother
           and son is a powerful thing.
                         

           But it's certain death.
                         

           On the contrary. It's connections
           like those that give the best
           chance to survive...
                         
          Lucy looks out to the Larry's fanciful armada. Hmmmm...
                         
                         

                         
          Doris gathers her strength in mid-air. Starts building a
          protective shield to cover her and Emmet. Can she do it?
                         
          YES! She lands with confidence. Poise. STRENGTH. A
          shield around her son, as well as her loving embrace.
          BOOM! The missile explodes, but they stand firm.
                         

           Get your hands off my flipping
           son.
                         
          Doris attacks the baddies with heretofore unseen
          ferocity. She breaks apart streetlamps and makes weapons.
          A mother protecting her son. She's like a whirling,
          quickbuilding kung-fu superstar. She is the best fighter
          in the universe.
                         

           Mom... Wow. Just... wow.
                         

           I'm the Chosen One, remember?
                         

           I guess that makes two of us.
                         
          They start to fight TOGETHER. Kicking much butt. It's
          superbadass and incredibly heartwarming to see them
          finally working as a team.

                         
                         

           I was wrong, Emmet.  All
           this time I was trying to keep you
           from getting hurt, so I told you
           not to make waves.  I'm just
           so glad that I get to see the
           beautiful waves you finally get to
           make.
                         

           
                         
          They make their way to the SKT2, but the Black Falcon
          sees them coming!
                         

           Aw. That's sweet. I want to take
           a picture so I can remember you
           like this FOREVER!
                         
          The SKT2 takes in a big inhale, about to freeze them...
          When in lands the most colorful and whimsical SUPERROBOT
          ever. Exactly opposite of the SKT2. It's made up of all
          the ships that the citizens of LEGOPOLIS have built.
          This is WHIMSYBOT, and LUCY's is in the center.
                         

           Lucy? How did you do that?
                         

           I used a few connections.
                         
          LEGO ROBOT FIGHT! WhimsyBot clocks SKT2! They knock
          over buildings! WHAMO! It's awesome! The WhimsyBot
          gains the upper hand, knocks the SKT2 on its BUTT!
                         
          This gives Emmet and Doris a clear pathway to climb on to
          the SKT2 and scramble up to the cockpit where the Black
          Falcon is. Doris rips open the cockpit with her bare
          hands. She jumps in and kicks the Black Falcon's ass.
                         

           Emmet, now's your chance!
                         
          Emmet scrambles to the SKT2's mouth, holding the Cone of
          Power at the Kragle. But at the last second, his route
          is cut off by the BLACK FALCON, holding Doris hostage.
                         

           Nuh-uh-uh. One step closer, and
           bye-bye mommy. Now go away, you
           freak, you weirdo, you loser. You
           don't belong here. You don't
           belong anywhere.

                         
                         
          EMMET GETS AN IDEA - we see this as we have before.
                         

           You're right. I don't belong
           here...
                         
          And he runs away... or does he? No! He runs around the
          back of the SKT2 and tunnels in through the back of its
          head! He lifts the CONE OF POWER!
                         

           I belong here!
                         

           No!
                         

           Rest in pieces.
                         
          And he caps the Kragle.
                         

                         
          A beat. Then the whole SKT2 EXPLODES into a million LEGO
          pieces! Emmet and Doris and The Black Falcon are thrown
          high into the air.
                         
          OVER AT THE VOLCANO across the world: The Black Falcon
          falls into the Volcano lava lamely. PLOP.
                         
          DOWN IN LEGOPOLOIS, everyone GASPS. It seems the SKT2
          explosion killed Emmet and Doris.
                         
          That's when two enormous five-fingered LEGO clouds shaped
          like hands, one grown up one, one kid one, enter the
          frame from above. THE HANDS OF THE MAKER. They catch
          Emmet and Doris in midair, and put them together safely
          on the ground.
                         
          Emmet holds the original Kragle tube, and gives it back
          to the Cloud Hands, which take it up in the sky in a
          marvelous light show. Think the Abyss, or Close
          Encounters. Everyone stares at it, admiring the artistry.
          The lights shines in their faces.
                         
                         

                         
          We see Finn and Ted playing together. Being silly. They
          "flip" the Krazy Glue end over end into the GARBAGE.
                         



                         
                         

                         
          The lands begin to UNFREEZE!
                         
          - A person votes!
                         
          - Two teens with braces finally Kiss!
                         
          - A baby is delivered to his father.
                         

           --oy!
                         

           Thank God!
                         
          - the robot performer unfreezes! But doesn't move. :(
                         
                         

                         
          The frozen diorama family UNFREEZES, and wraps each other
          in a big family hug.
                         
                         

                         
          The walls of the different worlds come CRUMBLING DOWN.
          Knights hug cops; Wizards hug robots; everyone CHEERS.
          Batman hugs Princess Leia, who is creeped out.
                         
                         

                         
          Lucy emerges from the wreckage. She looks around.
                         

           What the heck just happened?
                         

           Something totally foofy.
                         
          Emmet hugs Lucy and they KISS as well as a minifig can.
          Meanwhile, Neckbeard and Doris check each other out a
          little.
                         


           Ahoy there.
