          A SIGN. Twelve feet across. Painted decades earlier, grim-
          covered black, white and red. It reads in large 40's era,
          hand-painted type, "SAFETY IS OUR PRIMARY CONCERN!" Then:
          "DAYS SINCE LAST ACCIDENT" and below that, NUMBERS, painted
          on hanging metal cards. Four possible digits can hang here,
          but there are currently three: "784."
                         
          SLOWLY PUSH IN on this sign as a MAN APPEARS, rising on a
          forklift, in a greasy, monochromatic work jumpsuit. Removes
          the "4" from its hooks. Then removes the "8." Then the "7."
                         
          Finally, he hangs up a number. "1."
                         
          The man LOWERS out of frame as we creep even closer to the
          hanging single digit, wondering about the accident... and how
          bad it was and the FACTORY SOUNDS GROW DEAFENING -- AND AS IT

                         
                         

                         
          Shiny black loafers. Black pants, three inches too long. We
          BOOM UP, stopping at a boy's hand reaching into the black
          suit jacket pocket. Pulls out a WOMAN'S GOLD NECKLACE with a
          LOCKET. He holds the locket. Rubs it gently with his thumb.
          CONTINUE TO BOOM UP. We now SEE THE BOY'S FACE.
                         
          This is JOE LAMB, 14. On the precarious edge of adulthood. He
          looks out at the horizon with stricken eyes.
                         
          He moves forward and we PAN, so we're BEHIND HIM NOW. In the
          frosty distance, past countless leafless trees and modest
          homes, is a STEEL MILL. Smokestacks and structures. The
          lifeblood of this late 70's town.
                         
                         

                         
          Close on CHARLES' MOTHER AND FATHER, funeral attire. She
          looks out of the window sadly; heartsick and concerned.
          Behind her, he picks at his plate of food.
                         

           I'm so worried for that boy.

           Jack's gonna step up. He's a good
           man.
                         

           But he was never really a
           father...I don't think he
           ever...understood Joe.

          CHARLES  LEANS FORWARD, reaching
          for food on a buffet table. Charles' leaning has revealed
          CARY, a blonde kid in a dark blue sport jacket and tie, and
          PRESTON, pale and smart, in a DARK SWEATER:
                         

           What do you think was in the
           coffin?
                         

           Jesus, shut up.
                         

           I mean cause of how she died.
                         

           ... you weren't wondering that?
                         

           No, I'm eating macaroni salad.
                         
          We now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and
          MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet:
                         

           I was thinking that, about the
           coffin.
                         

           I don't know how you guys can eat.

                         
                         

           Try a Goddamn turkey roll and
           you'll discover how. They're

          CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the
          year 1979. At a wake. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly
          dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying.
                         

           Either nothing was in there, or
           like whatever they scraped up--
                         

           Jesus -- guys--
                         

          I heard it crushed her
          completely. At least keep your voices

                         

          A steel beam-- those things
          weigh a ton. Literally. If it had been open casket, I
           would not be eating right
           now. Despite the turkey
           rolls.
                         

           Hey-- Lucy.
                         
          They look up -- in the other room, a dog  has
          jumped on a guest, for food. JACKSON LAMB, Joe's father, 42,
          black suit, moves to the dog, walks her out of shot.
                         

           Bet Joe's not gonna wanna do my
           movie anymore.
                         

           Why?
                         

           Why do you think why? The story.
           It's about the living dead.
                         

           His mother's not a zombie.
                         

           But she's dead, shithead.
                         

           Those turkey rolls are pretty good.

          A WIDE SHOT. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in
          LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house,
          notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway.
          Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit,
          now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years.
                         
          He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. No doubt
          trying to reconcile the fact that it no longer hangs around
          his mother's neck. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has
          arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR
          with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as
          the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. Someone
          Joe has seen before, but doesn't know personally. A man in
          his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. He's not exactly
          sloppy, but if you look closely, you could tell he's been
          drinking. This is LOUIS DAINARD.
                         
          Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the
          porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for
          a while. Then he looks back to the locket. He OPENS IT, and
          stares at the picture inside . And as he
          stares, TEARS come to his eyes.
                         
          A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns
          toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something
          BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts
          open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never
          forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED
          Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad
          car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of
          freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable

                         

           I'll be home soon.
                         
          And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them
          drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket
          again. Mom's just gone. Finally he CLOSES IT -- and we hear
          an oddly LOUD SNAP and our SCREEN GOES BLACK.
                         
          Over darkness: APPLAUSE -- then a LONE VOICE: "I want you...
          to want me!" DRUMS kick in, CHEAP TRICK BLASTS. CUT TO:

                         
                         

                         
          Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for
          the year, winter a memory. GIRLS emphatically embrace each
          other good-bye. BOYS run off, just happy to be out. Lots of
          "Have a great summer!"
                         
          DOLLY WITH Joe, who walks through the crowd alone, backpack
          on shoulder.
                         
          Suddenly Charles is there, red-faced -- he hands Joe PAGES:
                         

           That was the longest day ever--
           here.

           You hear Martin barfed in the hall?

           I think it might help make my movie
           better. I need two things: a better
           story and production value.
                         
          They head across the street to the 7-Eleven. Suddenly Cary is
          there, a BURN WRAP on his right arm now:
                         

          Martin booted all over his

           did with my top hat?

           and ciphers-- she was in the silent
           reading section -- I thought,
           "Screw it." So I asked her if she'd
           play Hathaway's wife.
                         

           You talked to Alice Dainard really?

          Shut up. It's for "silent reading."

          To the train depot -- did you
          not read the scene I just
          gave you? Does Alice have a license? Is
           she old enough? Whose car are
           we taking? Are you making

          DARKNESS. Then a DOOR OPENS. It's DETECTIVE HATHAWAY (played
          by MARTIN), in silhouette. He enters. It's an old WAREHOUSE,
          dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with CRATES, old MACHINERY,
          CHEMICAL BARRELS and JUNK. The Detective turns on his
          FLASHLIGHT -- aims it -- sweeps it across the space -- the
          light HITTING THE LENS for a moment.
                         
          The Detective walks through the spooky, dark space. A low,

          Then: A SOUND -- quick but strange -- slithering -- and the
          Detective aims his flashlight -- tense. He watches. Waits. We
          see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through THICK
          DUST in the air. It's an old office door, ajar.
                         
          Hathaway is still. Nervous. Watching the door -- waiting for
          it to open... and then -- from the darkness BEHIND HIM -- a
          terrifying open-mouthed ZOMBIE APPEARS -- ATTACKS -- and the
          Detective TURNS -- his flashlight KNOCKED TO THE GROUND --
          and Hathaway falls too -- the wild-eyed gaping-mouthed Zombie
          DROOLING as it tries to bite Hathaway's flesh -- we recognize
          that the Zombie is CARY. Actually, not a bad performance. The
          Detective pulls out his GUN -- but the Zombie grabs his wrist
          -- they wrestle with the gun -- the Zombie wanting to rip
          into Hathaway's neck -- but Hathaway sees three SHARP-TIPPED
          NAILS sticking out of an old piece of WOODEN CRATE -- and
          after a significant struggle, Hathaway PUSHES THE ZOMBIE BACK
          so his head is IMPALED BY THE NAILS -- which we see ENTER HIS
          SKULL!!! The Zombie 
          SCREAMS AND DIES and just at Hathaway catches his breath THE
          IMAGE DIMS AND FREEZES; the projector has just been STOPPED.

          through the distant trees and it's beautiful, despite the
          distant belching SMOKESTACKS. Joe leaves Charles' house and
          CROSSES THE STREET to his own. SQUAD CAR in the driveway.

          on the ONGOING CLEAN-UP OF THREE MILE ISLAND. A half-empty
          BEER BOTTLE on the table. Joe peeks into the living room --
          but no one's there.
                         
          Joe looks around for his father. Heads down the hallway.
          Stops when he sees something off camera. We HOLD on Joe's
          face, sort of quietly stunned.

          Joe is stunned, staring at his dad. But he can't look away.
          And when he finally starts to head off, Jack looks up. Joe's
          mind scrambles for something to say, but Jack sniffles, gets
          it together, quick. Puts on a strong face.

          Commodores quietly sing "EASY" on the PA. Joe and his father,
          in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack eats a
          beef stew and reviews office paperwork, not looking at his
          son. Joe eats a grilled cheese, deeply lonely and not even
          knowing it.
                         
          Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table:

          from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS
          MOTHER'S LOCKET. Jack wants to cry again. He wants to throw
          that locket away, out of sight. But he just turns away.
                         
          Joe stares at the pamphlet. PUSH IN on the photo of beaming

          JOE, holding the brush, at his desk, making a model. A boy's
          room recently devoid of a mother's oversight; a mess. COMIC
          BOOKS and other PLASTIC MODELS, all built and painted by Joe.
          CARS and CREATURES and a TRAIN. His bedside CLOCK RADIO
           quietly plays "BAKER STREET." Then a RADIO SQUAWK -

          Twizzlers in the back, trying not to stare at Alice.
                         

           So I wrote a couple new lines, can
           I show you?

           What would be great is: could you
           cry during the scene? Can you do
           that?
                         

           ... no...?!
                         
          Cary messes with the radio. Alice moves his hand away.
                         

           Stop.
                         

           You know the first place I'm gonna

           Want one?
                         
          Alice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat.

           So I don't have any new lines,
           right? Because I just learned
           these.

          The Buick pulls up to this small, EMPTY TRAIN STATION in the
          middle of, essentially, nowhere. A series of HANGING LIGHTS
          illuminates the TRAIN PLATFORM. There's a small office,
          currently closed. No one around.

           Okay.

          Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading

           "-- Sweetheart, this is my job, I

          He gets up to reveal Joe putting make-up on Alice. He walks
          over to Martin, Cary and Preston. Charles and Martin AD LIB.
                         
          TIGHT ON JOE'S TACKLE BOX, which opens. Inside is an
          assortment of MAKE-UPS, sponges, cotton balls, brushes, derma
          wax, spirit gum, and a large jar of FAKE BLOOD. Joe is
          preparing to make up Alice, who sits in front of him,
          watching carefully as Joe prepares BASE MAKE-UP on a sponge.
          He looks to her. A beat.
                         

           You mind?
                         
          Alice shakes her head: nope. Joe starts stippling the make-up
          onto her face. He is now, via sponge, touching the face of a
          girl he's admired for some time. After a beat:
                         

           My dad works at the mill.
                         
          And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for
          something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too
          much for him to bear.
                         

           Close you eyes. Please.
                         
          He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe
          starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something
          provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes
          closed. Then, PRE-LAP:

          The lights  and
          camera  are set. Alice has been made up, wears a
          coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both
          look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera.

          just exploded a firecracker:

          Martin and Alice put away their pages -- Cary gets behind the
          camera. Charles stands near the camera, kneeling to camera-
          height. Joe wears headphones and holds the boom over the
          actors' heads. Preston holds a suitcase, ready to walk.

          We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice. Slowly amazed at the
          unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role --
                         

           Sweetheart. This is my job.

           You do have a choice. We all do...
                         
          And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs
          her lines. Not overdone, not hammy. Just fucking real.
                         

           John, I've never asked you to stop.
           I've never asked you to give up or
           walk away.
                         
          Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily
          transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes
          galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set:
                         

           But I'm asking you now-- please.
           For me. Don't go back. Don't leave

           I need to know this isn't the last
           time I'll see you.

           I just love you so much.

          And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure:
                         

           Was that okay? Or... not really?

          SUPER 8 box -- Joe grabs the mike -- Cary INSERTS the film:
          CLICK! Joe plugs in the mike, Charles grabs the camera:
                         

           Everyone ready...?! Be extra loud
           when the train passes by! Oh God, I
           hope it stops! You ready?!
                         
          They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in
          her background -- Charles puts on the headphones --
                         

           And... ACTION!

           I'm going to stay here and
           investigate. I think it would be

           Sweetheart. This is my job.
                         
          Charles watches, beaming with excitement. Joe holds the boom,
          looks to Charles to make sure it sounds okay; this is when he
          notices something in the distance. HEADLIGHTS. A quarter mile
          away, a vehicle drives along the horizon. A beat. But the
          train is APPROACHING -- GETTING LOUDER -- which makes Joe
          turn back toward the train -- the thing almost upon them --
          LOUDER AND LOUDER, so the actors begin to YELL over the

                         



                         



                         
                         


           John, I've never asked you to stop.
           I've never asked you to give up or
           walk away.
                         
          Joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very
          odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS. PUSH IN ON
          JOE, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Joe looks
          back toward Alice -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD!
                         

           But I'm asking you now-- please.
           For me. Don't go back. Don't leave
           me. I need to know this isn't the
           last time I'll see you.

           I just love you so much.
                         
          Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines -- Charles is
          almost LAUGHING at how good this looks -- but Joe LOOKS
          DESPERATELY BACK toward the headlights -- the train LIGHTING

                         

           I love you too!!
                         
          And Joe finally swings the mike down and YELLS:
                         

          GUYS, WATCH OUT!!! Joe what the hell are y--?!
                         
          -- just then BA-BA-BA-BAM!!! THE TRAIN ENGINE, HUNDREDS OF


                         

           Run!
                         



          PLATFORM, LANDING SIDEWAYS, STILL FILMING as the CRASH WAVE

                         



                         

           Alice!
                         

           Joe, we have to go.

                         
                         
          They run off.
                         


                         



          And then --
                         
          IT'S OVER. Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH-
          SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of
          STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel.
                         
          In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly
          shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD
          METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted
          STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around
          him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But
          what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe
          BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN --
          MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then
          AGAIN and AGAIN!!!
                         
          We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND --
          THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE

          -- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty
          feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it --
          stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it
          is GONE. Nothing.
                         
          TIGHT ON CHARLES' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A

                         

           Guys?!
                         
          Joe finds MARTIN, on his knees, THROWING UP -- Martin keeps
          throwing up, but pumps a THUMBS UP.
                         

           Martin, are you okay?! Preston, is
           that you?
                         

           I'm okay! Though I think I'm having
           a heart attack! And I have a
           scrape!
                         
          Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary
          appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash:

                         
                         

           Guys, did you see those explosions?
           That was awesome.
                         

           Has anyone seen Alice?!
                         

           I'm alive! Is anyone dead?
                         
          Through the debris, steel and dust. Joe moves forward --
          Charles, shaken, eyes wide, appears through the thick dust --
                         
          Joe moves forward, looking at, under a train WHEEL
          ASSEMBLY... BLOOD. A PUDDLE OF BLOOD and Joe's heart sinks as
          he moves toward it -- another woman he loves, crushed?!
          Charles and Preston and Cary see the blood --
                         

          -- oh God-- -- no -- nonono...
                         
          Martin, still sick, calls out:
                         

          -- what? Guys, what is it? ... shit...
                         
          Joe moves closer to the blood -- heartsick -- on the verge of
          DEEP, REAL TEARS -- everything stops -- but then:
                         

           -- what's all that blood?
                         
          Joe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE --
          shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS.
                         

           What's the blood? -- did someone
           get hurt--?
                         
          But JOE SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches
          below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out --
                         

           Joe, wait -- maybe you shouldn't
           touch -- what are you-- careful!
                         
          Joe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens:
                         

           It's my fake blood. It's fake!
                         

           What is this stuff?

                         
                         
          ALICE NOTICES THAT HE'S HOLDING THE NECKLACE. Joe notices
          this and POCKETS IT self-consciously. PRESTON calls out:
                         

           Guys, what are these things?
                         
          Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads
          off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many
          shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES
          which now litter the ground. Joe kneels, picks one up:
                         

           Hey, don't touch it, what are you
           doing?
                         

           They look like white Rubik's cubes
           or something. They're heavy like
           metal or something. There's like a
           billion of them.
                         
          It's just a few inches per side, an UNUSUAL DESIGN. Behind
          them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train
          cars, Cary calls out:
                         

           Guys, get up here. You can see
           everything from up here.
                         
          They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE
          WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. It is SOBERING.
                         

          Oh my God. ... Look at that...
                         

           According to my Uncle Seth, an
           accident like this is exceptionally
           rare.
                         

           It wasn't an accident.
           (turns away, eyes on the

           There was a truck. On the tracks.
                         

           What? Driving on the tracks?
                         
          Joe's seen it. He points. Chilled.
                         

           There.

                         
                         
          Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP
          TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown
          grass.
                         

           How can a pick-up truck derail a
           train? That's impossible.
                         

           Obviously it isn't.
                         
          BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids
          approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at
          the truck and STOP; what they see makes Joe's heart pound --
          they're stunned -- all of them. They just stop. Finally:
                         

           ... holy shit...
                         

           -- is that him?
                         

           
           -- yeah, it's him--
                         

           -- who?
                         

          It is, yeah, for sure-- Holy shit.
                         

           What? Who is that?
                         
          WE SEE NOW: it's DR. WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and
          unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. Alice moves
          closer -- scared and sad for him --
                         

           Dr. Woodward...?
                         
          No one can take their eyes off this as, SOTTO:
                         

           That's Dr. Woodward? The science
           guy?
                         

           Biology.
                         

           Honors biology.

                         
                         

           Wow... I'm not in his class.
                         

           We know.
                         

           Shut up, Cary.
                         

           Remember when Old Man Woodward took
           your Electronic Football?
                         

           Yeah, he put it in the "dungeon,"
           never gave it back...
                         

           The dungeon?
                         

           That trailer Woodward keeps in the
           school parking lot.
                         
          Joe moves next to Alice, who reaches out and gently NUDGES
          him -- you keep expecting him to suddenly grab her --
                         

           ... Dr. Woodward?
                         
          But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his
          arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING
          A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it
          up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper.
          They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward.
          We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to
          Dayton -- and NUMBERS written along the way.
                         

          Map of the contiguous United
          States... -- what's the writing?
                         

          -- dates and times. -- what's that line across?
                         

           It's a schedule for the train.
                         
          But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they
          can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR.
          WOODWARD IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE:
                         

           -- who-- who are you?

                         
                         
          They're all speechless for a moment. Finally, too loudly:
                         

           Dr. Woodward! It's Charles Kaznyk!
           From fourth period! You've been in
           an accident!
                         


                         

           They will kill you. Do not speak of
           this -- or you -- and your parents -
           - will die.
                         
          We're on Joe's stunned face -- but DISTANT VOICES make him
          turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck,

                         

           -- guys, look --
                         
          The rest turn to look -- their minds are racing, all of them:
                         


           -- we shouldn't be here--
                         


                         
          The kids start moving away --
                         

          My dad will de-ball me! Let's get out of here!!!
                         
          Now they're SPRINTING -- FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer.
                         
          Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera.
                         
          Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse --
          she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer:
                         


                         
          Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the
          car, past a whining Charles.
                         



                         
                         
          As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the
          front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice SLAMS the car
          into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then
          RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their
          adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA,
          eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL
          NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him.
                         
          CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps
          to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the
          disappearing car. We PUSH IN ON HIS BURNING EYES AND --
                         
                         

                         
          RRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRR! The Buick speeds past.
                         
                         

                         
          Overlapping mayhem, but Charles obsesses over his camera:
                         

          Holy shit, that was insane! He had a gun! An actual
           physical gun!
                         

          I can't believe all that just
          happened here! Nothing ever My whole camera lends is like
          happens here!!! shattered now!

          ON THE LOCAL NEWS; HELICOPTER SHOT of the wreck. The CHYRON
          READS, "TRAIN DERAILED - AIR FORCE AIDS CLEAN UP." Joe sits

           personnel after last night's train
           derailment. Woodward apparently
           fell asleep at the wheel of his
           pick-up truck, which was hit by the
           speeding train at approximately one
           AM. Eighty-two train cars were
           thrown from the tracks in the
           derailment, the largest such
           accident in Ohio's history. The
           condition of Woodward, who has

          Alice at her front door. She seems unnerved:
                         

           I don't care what Charles wants-- I
           said no on the phone.

                         
                         

           You totally did, that's true, I
           know, but--
                         

           And now you're at my house.

           It's too weird after last night-- I
           don't understand how you guys can
           keep working on your stupid movie,
           I really don't.
                         

           We have to-- while the crash is
           still there.

           No.
                         
          But Alice's eyes have flicked to the Buick, pulling up.
                         

           You should go.
                         
          Joe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got
          arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery
          bag. He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches:
                         

           What's this?
                         

           He was just inviting me to a party.
                         
          Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but
          at the same time, can barely look at him:
                         

           She's not going to your party.
                         

           Yessir.
                         
          Louis throws Alice a dark, resentful glare.

                         
                         

           You know better than this.
                         
          She nods, uncomfortable. Louis turns to Joe:
                         

           You get outta her. You go home and
           don't come back, I don't wanna see
           you.
                         
          Louis goes back inside. Alice follows, turns to Joe. As
          awkward moment between them. Then, quietly, conflicted:
                         

           I'll do it.
                         

           -- what?
                         
          She closes the door. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy. Off
          his smile, we HEAR LOUD POPS: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM!
                         
                         

                         
          Martin -- as Detective Hathaway -- FIRES A GUN -- shooting
          CARY, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man TURNING INTO A ZOMBIE
          -- his eyes WIDE AND GLOSSY WHITE -- and as he is HIT BY THE
          BULLETS, he SLAMS HIS HAND ONTO HIS CHEST -- BLOOD BURSTS ALL
          OVER HIM and he FALLS PAINFULLY TO THE GROUND. We then find
          CHARLES, behind his camera, yelling out:
                         

           CUT! That was mint! So good! And it
           looked huge with the train! Wow!

          WIDE SHOT, rising PAST SIX BICYCLES, thrown to the ground in
          a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe and Preston, with Joe's
          dad's KODAK CAMERA on tripod, have been filming, their gear
          scattered. KEEP MOVING OVER THEM, to Martin and Alice, who
          were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the TRAIN CRASH
          seems to go forever. MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS.
          HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice,
          who looks out at the crash. During all this:
                         

           We'll get the other direction next -
           - Alice, that was mint-- Martin, go
           a little faster next time.

                         
                         

           I'll try, but I'm still crying
           about last night, I feel like I'm
           crazy.
                         
          Cary sits, pulls off the CUT-OUT PING PONG BALLS that were
          covering his closed eyes.
                         

           Did it really look good? My death?
                         
          CLOSE ON JOE as he arrives beside Alice, who looks out at the
          train, haunted. Quiet:
                         

           ... what do you think happened...?
                         
          Joe stops reloading the gun, looks out, gets lost as well.
                         

           You mean why he crashed the train?
                         

           I just got a horrible feeling.
                         
          Martin has arrives there too. Preston too:
                         

           Anyone else still shaking from the
           crash?
                         

           I got in my parents' bed last
           night. Haven't done that since I
           was eleven.
                         
          Joe suddenly WALKS AWAY FROM THEM, back toward the camera.
                         

           ... did I just insult him?
                         
          Joe grabs the camera, near Charles:
                         

           -- dude, what are you doing?
                         
          Joe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the
          lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE JOE'S POV -- the CRASH,
          ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER.
                         
          Alice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat,
          finally standing up, looking out at the crash:

                         
                         

           That whole thing's an Air Force

          The kids sit at a table at the window. The CAR LOT is across
          the street. They're talking excitedly but quietly:
                         

           I make models-- plastic ones-- you
           know, glue `em, paint `em--

          A WAITRESS is there, delivering more FOOD --

           Sure.
                         
          She heads off. Cary smiles at Alice.
                         

           He is so sophisticated.
                         

          Shut up, I like coffee. No one likes coffee.
                         

           Keep going.
                         

           Air Force trains -- even models --
           have these hooks...
                         

           Ooo! Ooo ooo ooo! They do -- for
           when their train cars are put on

           every one...
                         

           Joe: stop talking about it.
                         

           Am I the only one who doesn't
           understand what this all means?
                         

           Probably, Smartin.
                         

           Shut up, I don't like that--

           and wanted to kill himself.
                         

           He had a gun, why not use that?

          Pussy, stop pulling the fries

           So, if it's Air Force, what would

           SHHHHJESUS! You heard what the Old

          The massive train wreck that goes on for a mile. Hundreds of
          MILITARY work to clean up fast. A truck DRIVES PAST CAMERA,
          taking us to Jack and Nelec, who WALK together amid the
          debris. Choppers land and take off in the background:
                         

           Yes, I understand, this crash has
           caused a whole mess of confusion.

           out just what happened here as well
           as how to help you out.

           Colonel, there isn't anything I

           Not that I can think of, Deputy. I

           our cargo.

           That's not going to be possible.
                         

           Colonel, I've got a lot of people
           in my town that are gonna want to

           Deputy, if you're asking me if we
           had any dangerous property on board
           this train, I can assure you the

          Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who stands, distracted, picking
          up reports from his desk, on his way out.
                         

           They gave me the run around for two
           hours before I was allowed to talk
           to anyone.

           Nelec -- the Colonel -- refused to
           show me their manifest, said they
           were carrying mostly airplane parts-
                         

           It's Air Force, Jack. Airplane
           parts sorta make sense.
                         

           Sheriff, I'm telling you, there's
           something else going on -- they're
           taking molds of tire tracks -- now
           why would they be doing that? Who
           are they looking for? And they're
           packing these weird little cubes
           into crates and they're--
                         

           Weird little cubes?

           dozens of these trucks -- and I'm

           get the hell outta there--

           wouldn't you?
                         

           Sheriff, I think you need to go
           check it out.
                         

           And I think you need a break.

           Jack, I've been telling you this
           since Elizabeth.



           You're a good deputy. But you need
           to take a vacation.

           Go home. Take off your uniform. Go
           fishing. And give your son a hug.
                         
          Pruitt walks off. Jack, unsettled, watches him go.
                         
                         

                         
          FINGERS TAPPING -- they're fingers on a COUNTER, a WALKMAN
          sitting beside them. BOOM UP to 23-year-old BREEN, who digs
          the BLONDIE he's listening to. He is alone in the station
          store. Behind him, 60-year-old SHERIFF PRUITT enters.
                         

           Hey Breen, I'm not sure Edie's
           paying you to listen to the radio.
                         
          Breen doesn't respond. The sheriff throws a candy bar at him.
                         

           Breen.
                         
          Breen pulls off the headphones.
                         

           Hey, Sheriff.
                         

           What's that?
                         

           Walkman. It's like a stereo, play
           your own cassette tapes.

           You wanna try it?
                         

           
           I don't think so. Kids walking
           around with their own stereos. Just
           what we need. It's a slippery
           slope.
                         
          He exits the store.
                         

           ... yessir.
                         
          Pruitt heads out; Breen puts the headphones on again.

                         
                         

                         
          We see we're at the lonely gas station the kids drove past
          earlier. Pruitt's SQUAD CAR filling up, the only car here.
          High overhead, a yellow KELVIN sign TURNS atop a tall pole
          near the road. Pruitt crosses to his car. Peels the candy
          bar. Hearing something, he turns -- a PACK OF DOGS RUN BY. A

          CLOSE UP of the PUMP'S SPINNING white NUMBER on black; the
          gallons and dollar amount blurring higher -- then A BIZARRE
          REFLECTION -- Pruitt sees it, turns -- and what he sees is
          TALL AND TERRIFYING -- he DROPS THE CANDY -- GOES FOR HIS

                         
                         

                         
          Breen, eyes closed, blasts his Walkman (we only hear TINNY
          MUSIC) as, through the window behind him, the rear of the
          squad car SUDDENLY SPRINGS UPWARD VIOLENTLY as if the FRONT
          SECTION WAS SUDDENLY CRUSHED! PRUITT SCREAMS, MUFFLED, as the
          CAR SLAMS back to the pavement -- LIGHTS FLICKER --

          PRUITT'S SCREAMS END as Breen OPENS HIS EYES AND RIPS off the
          headphones: the hell was that? He looks outside -- sees the
          car -- shattered windows. Confused, he heads out --
                         
                         

                         
          Breen moves tentatively toward the CRUSHED CAR -- quickly
          glances for Pruitt, who's missing. He gets close to the car,
          confounded by what he sees -- hands shaking, he rights the
          pump and replaces it. His heart pounds as he starts for the
          building -- but SLIPS ON THE GAS -- falls hard -- looks up --
          sees whatever's coming for him -- SCREAMS as he gets to his
          feet and RUNS LIKE A MOTHERFUCKER --
                         
                         

                         
          Breen RUSHES INSIDE -- we're WITH HIM as behind him:
          KKKRASH!!!! An EXPLOSION OF GLASS AND JUNK FOOD and --

                         
                         

                         
          WE LOOK DOWN UPON THE STATION FROM UP HIGH -- where the
          turning, lit KELVIN SIGN BLOCKS OUR VIEW FOR THE MOMENT -- we
          can only HEAR THE HORROR happening inside the station until
          FINALLY the sign REVEALS THE STATION -- everything inside
          looks like it's in a BLENDER -- THERE'S A SUPER-HUMAN
          UPHEAVAL HAPPENING IN THERE -- and Breen's SCREAMS CONTINUE
          as the turning Kelvin sign BLOCKS OUR VIEW AGAIN -- as the

                         
          A FACE. A MAKE-UP BRUSH APPLYING MAKE-UP. It's ALICE, and
          she's becoming a ZOMBIE. We are:
                         
                         

                         
          Joe makes her up -- a not half-bad, simple ZOMBIE MAKE-UP.
          Pale skin, sunken eyes and cheekbones. In the background, the
          other kids prepare to film.
                         
          He hands her a mirror, she gazes into it, sort of amazed.
                         

           Where'd you learn how to do this?
                         

           Mostly the Dick Smith Monster Make-
           up Handbook.
                         
          She nods. Whatever. Charles is suddenly there, with Cary:
                         

           Hey! So I'm gonna need more shots
           of the train crash, obviously-- you
           know that train model you made? Can
           we blow it up and film it?
                         
          Joe doesn't want to do this at all. AT ALL. But...
                         

           ... sure.
                         

          Mint. Gnarly!
                         
          Charles and Cary head off, planning the explosions. Alice
          looks at him knowingly.
                         

           I don't care, they can blow it up.
           I can show you the train, it's
           nothing, it's stupid.




           You wanna see it? Later? The...
           train? My train model? The train I
           made?
                         
          The LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE DIM -- BROWN OUT -- then back on.
                         

          That's like the third time Dude. Bitchen.
          that's happened.
                         

           So how am I supposed to be a
           zombie?
                         

           Oh. Just be a lifeless ghoul.
           Someone with no soul, dead eyes.
           Scary. D'you ever have Mrs. Mullin?
                         

           For English? Yeah--
                         

           -- like her. But hungry, like
           hungry for human flesh. To make
           them turn into zombies, because
           that's what zombies do.
                         
          Alice considers this -- then, after a beat, starts doing her
          best zombie. Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good.
                         

           Oh my God. That's really good...
                         
          And Alice slowly leans in toward him -- is this performance?
          Or is this something else--? And she PUTS HER MOUTH ON HIS
          NECK IN A FAKE BITE, which makes Joe go still -- a shiver
          down his spine -- he's never felt anything like this in his
          life. And when she pulls back, her performance over, she's
          smiling. He doesn't know what to say, tries to stay cool.
                         

           ... not bad.
                         
                         

                         
          We're NEAR THE GAS PUMPS, LOW TO THE GROUND -- DOLLY as Jack,
          EDIE and MR. BLAKELY come out here. We pass SMALL SHATTERED

           I've lost.

           Sheriff...
                         
          Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19. Jack pulls out
          a handkerchief, lifts the fun -- PUSH IN ON the engraved
          initials "H.P." JACK IS ROCKED BY THIS. He opens the cylinder
          to check if it had been fired.
                         
          CUT BACK WIDE. No squad car here. Jack checks out the broken
          BLUE AND RED PLASTIC as he makes a walkie call:
                         

           I think this is most likely a bear
           attack.

           Vicky, I need you to have Dayton
           send a CS unit out to Edie's. You
           put out an APB on the Sheriff and

           What the hell am I supposed to do?
           Insurance company thought I was
           joking with him. Look at my
           Bonneville here-- look at this. I
           got a call about this car

           out with financing last year,
           wouldn't be surprised if this was--
           some sorta sick retribution.
                         
          As Jack heads back to his car, THREE RESIDENTS move to him,

          Jack, my lights keep going on about it. And then we can
          and off. Counting on you, take care of these things. If
          Jack. you do that for me, I promise
           you, I'll handle it myself.
                         
          He seems to have appeased them -- but as he turns, we see how
          stressed he is. He stops, noticing FOUR MILITARY TRUCKS
          DRIVING PAST, SLOWLY, ANTENNAS atop the trucks, and the men
          inside seemingly scanning the area. Jack is disturbed by
          this.

          A community CORKBOARD. Joe posts up a piece of paper; we SEE

          on Joe's face as he finishes pinning it up -- when something
          he sees makes him stop. He slowly takes a step back. Then
          another... his eyes glued to the board.
                         
          Then we see the REVERSE -- SLOWLY PULLING BACK -- REVEALING

          SIGNS POSTED ON THE BOARD. It's COVERED in them. Joe is so
          stunned, he doesn't notice the MILITARY TRUCKS that pass in

          The officers agree. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad
          and other convene.
                         

           -- the Air Force isn't answering a

           I know. They're saying it's just
           clean-up at the train crash, but
           they're taking molds of tire
           tracks. Which means they're looking
           for someone-- now what's that
           about?
                         
          Joe has heard this and DROPPED HIS FLASHLIGHT -- the men all
          turn, silent. Joe, on the spot:
                         

           -- have you... seen Lucy?
                         

           I'm sure she's around. I put a
           couple of slices in the fridge for
           you there.
                         

           -- oh-- I ate those. Sorry, Kid--
                         

           That's... okay, I'll find a--
                         
          Then the POWER GOES OUT -- the men react -- it FLICKERS ON
          AND OFF -- Jack grabs his radio a the POWER RETURNS:

                         
                         

           Vicky, you got power at the
           station?
                         

           On and off. Brook County's in the
           dark.
                         

           Get water and power out there now.
                         
                         

                         
          Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room,
          watching In Search Of and talking to Charles on his walkie
          talkie.
                         

           So the Air Force is looking for a
           car -- Alice's dad's car -- they're
           taking tire prints from the crash
           site. Over.
                         

           I don't wanna hear about it. They
           could be monitoring us right now!
           Jesus, shut up. Over!
                         


           And the military's at Woodward's
           house. Looking for his research.
           Whatever that means?
                         

           Joe -- YOU CAN NOT FLAKE OUT ON ME
           AND BE A DICK! Are you gonna come
           help me tomorrow or not? I need you
           to make Alice a zombie again.
                         
          And Joe tries to snap himself out of it. But is disturbed.
                         

           Okay... I'll do the make-up. Over.

          ROONEY, 49. Cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a
          weathered clipboard. Glances at the power line. Doesn't
          understand what he sees -- PUSH IN ON HIM. He radios in:
                         

           This is Rooney at Mary-10, was
           there re-routing on this line?
                         

           Negative, but the grid through
           Liberty is dark.
                         

           ... yeah, `cause there's no
           overhead lines on these poles.
                         

           -- come again?
                         

           No power, no comm cables. Stand by.
                         
          He DRIVES AGAIN -- we see a WIDE SHOT OF THE LANDSCAPE --

                         
                         

                         
          The truck comes to a stop, roadside. Tall trees and a SALVAGE
          YARD behind them. PUSH IN ON ROONEY who calls in:
                         

           We got over a half mile of copper
           missing.
                         

           -- that-- doesn't sound possible.
                         

           Lines are back up at M-38.
                         
          In the cherry picker bucket, Rooney works the controls. He
          begins LIFTING; a WIDE SHOT shows him rising to the bare
          utility pole STEPDOWN TRANSFORMER. When Rooney finally gets
          to the top, with gloves hands, he inspects the transformer.
          After a moment, though, he stops. HEARS something else, past
          the sound of electricity. He looks over toward the SALVAGE
          YARD. Except it's mostly hidden by the trees. From here,
          Rooney can only see the tops of the JUNK PILES. A small
          METALLIC CRASH. Then ANOTHER.

                         
                         
          Rooney cranes his neck to get a view. Another METALLIC CRASH,
          this time GLASS BREAKING, too. Then, in the distance, at the
          middle of the salvage yard, SOMETHING FLIES INTO THE AIR,

                         
          Rooney strains his eyes to see -- what the hell was that? A
          tin can? A piece of a fender? Hard to tell from here.
                         
          Then, thrown into the air: A CAR TIRE. It lands with a THUD.
          Rooney then uses the bucket controls -- MOVES BACKWARD AND UP
          -- a touch higher toward the transformer -- not exactly
          watching how close he is getting. He stops. Watches.
                         
          An ENTIRE JUNKED MOTORCYCLE flies into the air, discarded,
          twirling, and CRASH LANDS, out of sight.
                         
          Rooney is stunned. As the METALLIC RUMMAGING SOUNDS CONTINUE,
          Rooney moves the bucket EVEN HIGHER -- when suddenly his
          bucket BEEP-BEEPS LOUDLY -- a warning he's too high -- and he
          suddenly stops it and the BEEPING STOPS --
                         
          But so do the rummaging sounds. SILENCE, save for the eerie
          HUM OF POWER. He waits. Nothing. Wants a better view, so he
          begins to LOWER THE BUCKET.
                         
          We're in a WIDE SHOT, seeing his DESCEND, PAINFULLY SLOWLY.
                         
          Then we're in a LONG LENS CLOSE UP of Rooney as he SLOWLY
          DROPS -- TIGHT ON HIM as he's looking over toward the salvage
          yard -- and it takes us a minute to realize there's fucking







          MOVEMENTS, UNTIL THE TRUCK IS MOTIONLESS. Empty. Alone.
                         
          Then: NOISE -- and an AMPLIFIED VOICE:
                         

           I wanna know who took `em.
                         
                         

                         
          A LOUD TOWN MEETING. Two-hundred frustrated CITIZENS crowd
          the auditorium. Jack at the podium, TOWN OFFICIALS, including
          the local MAYOR sit on stage as well. Currently, MRS. BABBIT,
          52, speaks into the microphone on the floor:

                         
                         

           Twenty microwave ovens: gone from
           my inventory. Brook County's
           without power -- this feels to me
           like a Russian invasion.
                         
          The town ROARS its approval -- Jack, impotent, tries:
                         

           Mrs. Babbit, I don't believe the
           Russians have anything to do with
           what's happening in town-- but I'm
           calling the curfew because w--
                         

           Until you can tell me who's messing
           with us, I say it's the Soviets and
           we're at war. I like you, Jack, but
           we need Sheriff Pruitt back.
                         
          The town ERUPTS in agreement --
                         

           We have good people working on
           that. Mr. McCandless.
                         
          A short, bald man of 65, MR. MCCANDLESS speaks:
                         

           Since Wednesday morning, my Ham
           radio's been a mess -- all sorts of
           frequencies I like to scan. Some
           kind of buzz modulation-- have you
           found that?
                         

                         

           Mr. McCandless, can I speak with
           you for a moment, privately?
                         
          The Mayor takes over as Jack has a SIDEBAR MEETING with Mr.

                         

          -- it was like having my -- that must be very annoying-
          radio hi-jacked-- - you don't know the
           frequencies off-hand, do you?

          Jack hurries from the town meeting to the station --
                         

           Jack, all the tools in the garage
           are gone.
                         

           Patty, get in touch with Vicky.
           David, have you seen Milner?

           There's a sink hole in my garage.
           It almost sank a foot.
                         

           Hey Tom. Tom, have you seen Milner?

          He heads for his office, seeing LOUIS, who is being escorted
          out by an Officer across the room.
                         

           Hey -- he was at my house yesterday
           morning, are you aware of that?
                         

           
           We brought him in about the car lot
           and other things -- he's clean.
                         

           I'd appreciate it if you would
           inform your son that my house if
           off-limits. And so it my daughter.
                         
          Louis heads out -- HOLD ON JACK AS he turns, ENTERS HIS
          OFFICE, and as that door opens, we CUT TO:
                         
                         

                         
          The door opens of his messy, motherless room. Joe and Alice
          enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks
          of comic, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed -- pair of
          underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath
          towel on his desk chair. She looks around sa she enters. The
          light dim, intimate.
                         

           Oh gawd, I didn't clean up.
                         
          Joe quickly moves a pile of papers and books from the desk to
          the floor; NOTEBOOKS AND SCHOOL WORK spill out and we get a
          GLIMPSE of some "B-MINUSES" and other "C-PLUSES" in RED.
                         
          Joe, embarrassed, hides them, then moves to his MODELS:
                         

           -- you made all these?

                         
                         

           Yeah, that's the Hunchback of Notre
           Dame. I watched that one on TV.

                         
          Alice sits on the bed. Joe takes the FIVE-CAR TRAIN MODEL.
          She moves close:
                         

           This is the train they wanna
           destroy.
                         
          Alice hold it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it.
                         

           ... it looks real.
           
           It looks so old...
                         

           That's dry brush technique.
           
           After you've painted the base
           color, you take something like...
           
           Euro Gray.
                         
          Her face is so close to his. Her hair touches his ear.
                         

           Euro Gray...
                         

           There are so many different grays,
           it's crazy. And you pour a little
           onto like a paper plate. Then you
           take a dry brush and you just dip
           it in, then you brush on the paper,
           so the paint's barely on the brush.
           Then you make small brush strokes
           on the model. Little ones, like
           where the wear and tear would be.
           Around the wheels. Or where the
           doors would slide. Then you do it
           again, like with Camouflage Gray--
           or here, I used Insignia Red to
           make it look like there was another
           coat of paint on there before. Like
           they painted over it, but you could
           see it scratched off.
                         
          Lost in thought, he looks at her. Suddenly self-conscious.

                         
                         

           What was that necklace?
           
           The one you were holding at the
           train crash. Was it your mom's?
                         
          It takes him a beat. Finally:
                         

           My dad gave it to her the day I was
           born. She wears it all the time.
           Used to.

           It was bad, how she-- died and
           stuff, but they got the necklace
           back. So.
                         
          Their tension INTERRUPTED BY an out of breath Charles:

           It's okay.

          Tally puts a MAP on his desk -- 28 DOTS in a CIRCLE, anywhere

          Officer Rosko at his desk, with a YOUNG WOMAN, a HAM RADIO at
          his desk beside a REEL-TO-REEL TAPE DECK. He takes notes:
                         

           It's not her. She never's
           disappeared before.
                         

           Alright. Now what does she look

           She's got dark hair, it was in

          Suddenly a GARBLED ELECTRONIC SOUND from the HAM RADIO. Rosko

          MILITARY VEHICLES parked everywhere. Personnel removing boxes
          from the house, packing it all up. But out front, Joe is
          dressed as an Airman, performing with Martin, dressed as the
          detective.
                         
          Military trucks surround the house. Hathaway is with a

           Suicide? Who was it?
                         

           A former Air Force officer. He
           called me last night, said he had a
           secret that he couldn't keep any
           longer.
                         
          Officer Joe hands Hathaway a FILE. Hathaway looks at it.

                         
                         

           What's this?
                         

           He worked at Romero Chemical. He
           found out some things the company's
           been doing. After what you told me
           at the bar, I thought you should
           know.
                         
          Cary behind the camera, Charles beside him:
                         


           Are we gonna get in trouble here--?

           the movie!
                         

           This proves it. They knew, the
           company knew. Thank you so much for
           the information.
                         

           We just made the discovery
           ourselves. You understand this is
           top secret.
                         

           Of course.

           information if you and I hadn't
           served together in Vietnam.
                         
          As it continues, we see Alice behind the camera, watching
          Joe, smiling. But then she sees something that disturbs her:
          Jack's CRUISER pulls up.
                         
                         

                         
          A dozen OFFICERS go through HUNDREDS OF CARDBOARD BOXES of
          documents. Books and personal belongings are put into boxes,
          taken from the house. Overmyer enters, crosses to Nelec, who
          reviews a folder.
                         

           Nothing so far--

                         
                         

           How much more is there?
                         

           Sixty boxes in the basement, maybe
           more.
                         

           What, more tax returns?
                         

           It's here somewhere. If we can't
           find it, Woodward'll tell us where
           it is.
                         
          But Nelec has seen something outside: THE KIDS.
                         

           ... the hell's that?
                         

           ... looks like kids making a
           movie...
                         
          Behind them, a WINDOW, showing the street, where Jack insists
          Joe get into the car. Nelec looks out -- sees Jack take Joe
          by the arm, grab the tripod and head to his squad car.
                         
                         

                         
          As Jack gets out, he sees the kids and isn't happy. He moves
          toward Joe and his friends:
                         

           Joe.

           Hey, Mr. Lamb!
                         
          Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabs his camera from
          Charles and saying firmly, to Joe:
                         

           Get in the car.
                         
          Joe is stunned -- instantly humiliated in front of Alice --
          he's taken back to the squad car --
                         

           Uh-- Mr. Lamb? That's your camera,
           but technically, that's my film--

                         
                         
          Jack OPENS the car's back door -- Joe gets in -- Jack SLAMS
          it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger
          seat and SLAMS that door, heading to the house, leaving Joe
          in the back. Nelec heads outside -- Jack moves to him:
                         

           I would like to help you out
           deputy. I really would. But we
           operate on a need to know basis.
                         

           Why are your trucks sweeping the
           town?
                         

           We'll be out of your way shortly.
                         

           Then I'm sure you wouldn't mind me
           contacting DC. Talk to some friends
           about "Walking Distance."
                         
          This lands on Nelec.
                         

           All right. We'll do it that way.
                         
          Jack heads off.
                         

           Deputy.

           Let's talk. Just not here.
                         
          Jack stops, turns to uncomfortable Nelec.
                         
                         

                         
          Joe, his breathing heavying, sits in the car, heart pounding,
          watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again.
          Then he looks over at his friends -- Charles giving him a
          "WHAT THE FUCK?!" Look. Alice watches him sympathetically.
          She mouths to him a guilty, "...is it me...?" And Joe shakes
          his head: "No." But we -- and she -- know better.

          Door opens. Jack enters, then lets Joe pass him. Joe closes
          the door hard and says, angrily, but restrained:
                         

           This is new. All this. For the both
           of us. Dealing with-- all this,
           just us. So I'm going to make this
           as clear and simple as I can:
           You're not friends with Alice
           Dainard. When I say no, I don't
           mean maybe. I don't mean yes. I
           mean no. I've known Louis Dainard
           for alotta years-- he's been
           nothing but trouble. Your mother
           used to say he's not a bad guy, he
           just needs a chance, he's just sad -
           - well I tried to be good to him,
           but I can't. Not anymore. I will
           not allow him or his daughter in
           this house. I will not allow you
           spending time with her, doing
           projects or whatever it is that
           you're doing. THAT'S IT. I hope
           we're clear.
                         
          Jack turns to leave -- but Joe, enraged, says:
                         

           We're not clear.
                         
          Jack stops -- stunned -- Joe's heart pounds --
                         

           What'd you say?
                         

           We're not clear. You and I aren't
           clear about anything. We couldn't
           be less clear.
                         

           Joseph Francis Lamb--
                         


           Just `cause mom died doesn't mean
           you know anything about me!!! You
           don't. You don't know about Alice

           I don't care what she is! Her
           father is a selfish, irresponsible
           son-of-a-bitch!
                         
          Jack moves CLOSE to Joe -- intimidating -- Joe steps back --
          Jack is fucking intense:
                         

           You listen to me, I've got twelve
           thousand people in this town that
           are scared out of their minds--
           they've got one person they can
           rely on -- it used to be someone
           else, but now it's just me.
                         
          Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying. And
          to whom he's saying it. But somehow, in this moment, he can't
          be a better father than law officer. Not yet. More upset at
          himself than Joe, he heads out.

          Joe sits, his back against his mother's grave. Holds her OPEN
          LOCKET, staring at it. He's just come here for comfort. But
          then -- a SOUND -- and Joe turns. Deep and low, in the
          distance. Joe is motionless. HEARS IT AGAIN. He stands, pulls
          out his flashlight -- aims the beam down ROWS OF GRAVES,
          toward the big CARETAKER'S SHED in the distance. Another
          INTENSE, LOW SOUND -- then a high pitch HIT, like METAL ON
          WOOD and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound -- then
          ANOTHER -- which TRANSITIONS US TO:

          Jack's car pulls up. He gets out of the car. Suddenly the
          three large MILITARY TRUCKS' HEADLIGHTS COME ON -- all aimed
          at Jack -- he is blinded -- tries to see --
                         

           Hello--?
                         
          And now BODIES are seen of SOLDIERS, holding and aiming
          WEAPONS. Then, a VOICE over a TRUCK PA:
                         

           Drop your weapons. Put your hands

          TIGHT ON NELEC. Past an IV and medical machinery. He's
          looking at someone we don't yet see. In the background,
          Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet, simple:
                         

           I don't want any more trouble. Do
           you?
                         
          Now we see who he's talking to. IT'S DR. WOODWARD. Battered
          and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid, but defiant.
                         

           We've been going through your
           belongings, looking for evidence.
           Of what you knew, how you knew
           it... and who else might know.

           I remember you. In the lab. And I
           recall we didn't see eye to eye,
           but that's no excuse for doing what
           you did here.

                         
                         
          Dr. Woodward swallows. Feels that his time on Earth is coming
          to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer
          is quietly putting on his BLACK GLOVES.
                         

           So in the spirit of moving forward
           and avoiding more trouble, tell us
           where you put your research. I know
           you had someone document the crash
           that night. Tell me who that was
           and I'll help you, I swear to God.
           On my mother's life -- if you help
           us now, we will take care of you.
                         

           I've seen what happens, Mr. Nelec,
           when you take care of people.
                         

           --I'm going to bait him. I'm going
           to catch him.
                         

           He's in me, you know. As I am in
           him. So when you see him next, as
           I'm sure you will... I'll be
           watching you, too.
                         
          Nelec offers a vague, searching smile. But Woodward will not -
          - not ever -- relent. So. Nelec moves to the door, he remains
          FACING CAMERA, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the
          bed. PUSH IN ON NELEC'S FACE, UNDERSTANDING HIS TRUE NATURE

                         
                         

                         
          Joe sleeps, power still out. Then, a KNOCK. He wakes up.
          Another KNOCK. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. It's
          Alice. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly:
                         

           -- are you-- were you sleeping?
                         

           Before, earlier, b-- no, you okay?
                         

           Yeah.
                         


           Oh, you wanna come in?

                         
                         
          And Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too.
          It's odd and silent for a moment.
                         

           Power's still out.
                         

           Room's still messy.
                         

           I was in bed, couldn't sleep.

           Thinking. I wanted to tell you
           something, before tomorrow -- Don't
           let Charles blow up your train.
                         
          Joe stares, amazed at her.
                         

           I don't think it's right, do you? I
           know he's your friend, but he's so

                         

           He can be sorta li-- I've known him
           since Kindergarten, though--
                         

           He shouldn't always get what he
           wants. I mean, who always gets what
           they want? -- I know I don't know
           you at all. Even though... it sort
           of feels like I do.

           Do you not... feel like that?
                         

           -- no, I totally do, I'm just...
           sort of in shock at this whole

                         
          And the POWER RETURNS -- Joe's CLOCK LIGHT goes on behind him
          -- but more chilling, the PROJECTOR comes back on; the SILENT
          HOME MOVIE OF HIS MOTHER PLAYS. Joe crawls to the projector
          to stop it -- but:
                         

           -- no, keep it-- please --
                         
          Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She
          watches the film. Can't take her eyes away.
                         

           ... is that her?

                         
                         

           ... yeah...
                         
          And as Alice watches, we GENTLY PUSH IN... as tears start to
          fill her eyes. Behind her, at a near WHISPER:
                         

           ... it's so weird watching her like
           this, like she's still here...
           
           ... she used to look at me, this
           way... like really look. And I
           just... knew I was there. That I
           existed.
                         
          A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that.
          Finally, quietly:
                         

           He drank that morning. My dad.

           He missed his shift.
           
           Your mom took it for him. The day
           of the accident.
                         
          Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Finally, eyes
          wet, Alice turns to Joe.
                         

           ... I know he wishes it was him.
           Instead of her.

           ... and sometimes I wish it was,
           too.
                         
          Joe just stares at her... heartsick and speechless. Finally:
                         

           Don't say that.

           He's your dad.
                         
          Just then, the SUPER 8 movie ENDS: the film FLIPFLIPFLIPS.
          Joe turns off the projector -- but a SOUND REMAINS. A sort of
          SHUDDER-HUM. Joe unplugs the projector, but the sound
          remains. Then they look: THE SHUDDERING IS COMING FROM THE
          CUBE HE TOOK FROM THE CRASH SITE, sitting on his desk.
                         
          Joe and Alice move to it. He turns on his desk lamp. The cube
          VIBRATES, almost imperceptibly.
                         

          -- has this--? -- no.

                         
                         
          Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube
          -- the thing SHUDDERS ON ITS OWN.
                         
          They are amazed. They get LOW -- eyes at desk level -- the
          SHUDDERING INCREASES IN PITCH AND VOLUME -- he reaches out to
          touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube BULLETS AWAY -

          FIVE-INCH HOLE IN THE WALL! She screams -- they both fall to
          the floor, STUNNED -- PUSH IN ON Joe, his heart pounding. He
          moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance,
          trees and the TOWN WATER TOWER.
                         
                         

                         
          Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully
          toward her room, when --
                         

           Morning.
                         
          His voice makes her JUMP. She turns: sitting in the dark, in
          an armchair, is her father. He's awake. And drunk.
                         

           You wanna tell me where you were?
           Or you want me to tell you.
                         
          A tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe.
                         

           Sit down.
                         

           I should go to bed.
                         

           I wanna talk to you. I said sit
           down.
                         

           I don't want to sit down.
                         

           Then go. Be just like your mother
           and leave.
                         
          This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house.

           There's nothing wrong--
                         
          As we CONTINUE BOOMING UP, we arrive at the top of the WATER
          TOWER, where THE CUBE HAS AFFIXED ITSELF TO THE SIDE --

          As Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house:
                         

           I'll get the camera back, I know
           where my dad put it -- We can still
           make the festival.
                         

           It's not about the movie.
                         

           Then what is it about?
                         

           Jesus, you don't even get it do
           you? It's obvious.
                         

           What's obvious?

          Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside. Joe follows.

           That night of the crash, you

           Your movie was over! That's what

           Don't pretend like you did it for

          Charles ROLLS THE FILM, DIMS THE LIGHTS --
                         

           It was never about me! It was
           always about Alice!
                         
          And suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there
          she is: ALICE, from the night of the train crash. The scene
          plays as they filmed it:
                         

           John. I don't like it. This case.
           These murders.
                         

           What am I supposed to do, go to
           Michigan with you?
                         
          THE FILMED SCENE CONTINUES as Joe and Charles argue:
                         

           Well, you're the one who wanted the
           wife in the movie!

                         
                         

           Not so you could fall in love with
           her!
                         
          Joe's mind spins -- how does he respond to this?!
                         

           What do you even care what I think
           about Alice?!
                         

           Because I like her! That's why!
           That's why I asked her in the first
           place! So I could get to know her,
           not YOU!
                         

           -- wait, you like Alice Dainard?
                         

           You're such an idiot.
                         

           
           Guys, look out!
                         
          They watch for a moment as the TRAIN CRASH HAPPENS -- but
          it's SO SUDDEN, SO FAST, the camera picks up almost nothing.
          Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the
          SETTLING DEBRIS. Charles moves forward, so the film is now
          partially BEING PROJECTED ON HIM.
                         

           SHIT! Look at all that smoke! We
           can't use any of this. And you
           won't even let me blow up your
           train. Everything's bogus.
                         

           We can make another train and blow
           that one up.
                         
          Joe moves forward. Part of the film PROJECTED ON HIM, too.
                         

           I do like her. Sorry about that.
                         

           Shut up. It's okay.

           That's not even what bothers me.
           
           It's that she likes you too. That
           really bothers me. I dunno...

                         
                         
          But Joe has seen something -- on the screen -- SOTTO:
                         

           ... Charles...
                         

           I know it's stupid. What would she
           ever like me? I haven't leaned out
           yet, which the doctor says is gonna

                         
          But Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the
          screen -- Charles looks too -- AND NOW WE SEE IT: through the

          FROM THE TRAIN CAR, THROUGH THE WRECKAGE -- what the hell is
          it? TOO DAMN BIG -- MOSTLY OUT OF FRAME, ITS SHAPE AND FLESH
          TOO BIZARRE -- we only see the LEGS as it clears frame --

          ON FILM -- then from outside: AN AIR RAID SIREN RAMPS,

          Finally, as we BOOM DOWN, RACK TO JOE AND CHARLES, trying to
          make sense of this -- Joe calls to a passing adult, MR.

          DONNY steps out of his 1972 PONTIAC CATALINA, carrying a

          fate. Somehow Nelec takes this moment to look into Joe's face
          -- to silently -- in a look -- repent. Instantly, Joe knows
          he's about to watch this man's life end.
                         
          SMASH! Nelec turns -- the creature is BUSTING the bus door --

          all their eyes on Nelec -- except Joe, who only wants to get
          to Alice. He sees the SHATTERED BULLETPROOF WINDOW -- above

          the other side of the glass, Nelec scrambles for Hernandez's
          fallen SEMI-AUTO RIFLE. He grabs it and scampers back to the
          glass as SMASH!!! Pieces of metal and glass BURST like ice
          chips as the creature violently WIDENS the bus door opening--
                         
          On Charles' shoulders, Joe can reach the shattered-but-thick

          essentially exactly what the creature is doing, in reverse.
                         
          Using both fists, Joe POUNDS the window. No give.

          GUNFIRE BARELY AUDIBLE behind the glass with the boys as Joe
          hits the glass again -- BAM -- a CRINKLING of glass --
                         

           You can do it!
                         
          Joe hits again -- so does the creature -- as Nelec RUNS OUT
          OF AMMO. That was never really hope anyway. Joe hits again
          and CRASH! The window SHATTERS! Glass chunks RAIN DOWN on the
          boys -- all covering their face -- Cary seeing the CREATURE

                         

           Go! Joe, move!!!
                         
          With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up -- outside
          the bus, Joe peeks out -- the fucking creature -- its back to
          Joe -- just fifteen feet away, focused on the door -- and Joe
          strains to climb out here, onto the top-side of the bus.
                         
          And as the boys climb out, the creature climbs in -- first
          Joe, then Charles (AD LIB DIALOGUE WITH CARY AND MARTIN: "You
          gotta lose some weight --" "I know!!!"), Then Cary, and
          Martin last -- they all jump down to the dirt -- they hear
          SCREAMS and turn back for a moment --
                         
          Inside the bus, Nelec watches as the creature ENTERS THE

          TERRIFYINGLY DOWN THE AISLE TOWARD HIM. And as the creature
          descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge --
          Nelec says, eerily quietly, terrified:
                         

           -- it was my turn once... to find
           you. Now... it's your t--

                         
                         
          Before he can finish, the creature fucking ATTACKS -- and it
          would be horrible and brutal, if the BLOOD DIDN'T SPRAY UPON


                         
          In the field, a distance away, the boys watch the bus SHUDDER
          and SHAKE. Then... silence. They see the creature burst out
          of the bus -- then RUN OFF -- fast and stealthy, away from
          them in the overgrown grass, like a native hunter. Which, of
          course, is partly what it is. They're sort of stunned.
                         

           I just sharteezed a little.
                         
                         

                         
          Louis stares off, lost. Two AIR FORCE SOLDIERS arrive:
                         

           You need to come with us, we have
           some questions for you --
                         

           -- what, is she... Is she dead--?
                         

           Just come with us.
                         
          Standing is hard for heartsick Louis, his legs so hurt --
          suddenly JACK IS THERE, acting the role of Air Force:
                         

           Hey fellas, I've got orders from
           Colonel Nelec to personally
           transport this man to base.
                         

           He's all yours, Staff Sergeant.
                         
          As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his
          shoulders, heads off in the other direction, as Louis looks
          him over, confused:
                         

           Where're we going--?
                         

           -- to find our kids.
                         
          On LOUIS' FACE -- a surprised glimmer of HOPE --

                         
                         

                         
          Moments later, TIGHT on a POCKET -- Joe pulls out his
          MOTHER'S NECKLACE. WIDEN to see that he's taken the necklace
          from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack.
                         

           Got my fireworks back!
                         

           
           Congratulations!
                         
          They turn: a car comes, fast -- PUSH IN ON JOE who studies
          the oncoming car, as behind him:
                         

           They're coming, man! I think we
           should go!
                         

           No--!!! No, look!
                         
          The car ARRIVES: It's DONNY. He gets out of his car, wild-
          and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them:
                         

           Ho ho!!! You dorks are alive! I
           didn't know...!
           
           ... what the FUCK?!
                         

           We need to get back to town!
                         

           Hop in, man! But you should know: I
           am massively stoned right now.
                         

           You want me to drive?
                         
          Donny looks at Joe, like it hurts to think.
                         
                         

                         
          The Catalina cruises fast through the deserted neighborhood --
                         
                         

                         
          Joe drives, Donny is ASLEEP. Other boys in the back.

                         
                         

           Joe, where are we going?
                         

           I saw something at the cemetery.
           Woodward said it's subterranean-- I
           think I know where it--
                         

           What's that? What are those sounds?
                         

           Guys, that sounds like guns!
                         

           
           What the hell is that?!
                         
          SUDDENLY, BOOM!!! A DEAFENING, CONCUSSIVE GUNBLAST! They're
          LIT UP by what they see ahead: in the oncoming cross-street,

          AGAIN AND AGAIN AT SOMETHING WE CAN'T YET SEE! The boys COVER
          THEIR EARS -- Donny awakens, but only for a moment --
                         


                         
          Joe quickly turns left into a driveway -- but we PUSH IN
          TIGHT ON HIM -- from the direction they just came are MORE
          TANKS AND MILITARY VEHICLES -- Joe's eyes go wide -- they're
          stuck. GUNFIRE CONTINUES!
                         

           We gotta go by foot--!
                         

           Where?!
                         

           Just follow me!
           
           Donny! Hey! Donny, wake up!
           
           We have to get out of here!
                         

           He's too stoned!
                         

           Drugs are so bad!
                         
          Joe and the boys get out of the car fast and RUN across the
          street, zig-zagging between the enormous MILITARY VEHICLES --

                         
                         

                         

           Sir, the weapons are misfiring!
           Surface to air, radar -- all of
           them! It's a mess out here, sir.
                         
          Soldier hurries off.
                         
                         

                         
          Joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot
          of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO
          SHIT in collateral damage.
                         
          An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run
          BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing
          through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and
          some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG
          HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside --
                         
                         

                         
          -- they run in for cover -- they're silhouetted in this dark
          space by the EXPLOSION LIGHT emanating from the windows.
          They're all out of breath in a strange KITCHEN --
                         

           You guys see those explosions? They
           were huge.
                         

           -- whose house is this?
                         

           
           Kathy's. I got it off the fridge.
                         

           Kathy? Oh, Kathy's cool.
                         
          Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION -- the light fixtures
          sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter.
                         

          Charles-- that's not yours-- -- what?! I'm thirsty and I'm
           in a war zone!
                         
          Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and
          the creature ROARING --

                         
                         
          And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window --
          Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts:
                         

           Come on, guys, let's go. Come on!
                         
          Joe runs -- the others follow --
                         

           Where we going?
                         

           To the cemetery--
                         
          But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT
          A WALL! They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a
          sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete. If there's good news
          here, the creature has left this area -- the explosions
          getting further away. But there's blood and Martin is in real
          pain.
                         

           What happened to my leg? It hurts.
                         

           Oh shit, Martin, you gotta bone
           sticking out of your leg!
                         

           There's a hole in the house!
                         

           Joe, gimme that thing on the
           curtains!
                         
          Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on
          the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be
          seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric
          tie -- which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it
          around Martin's leg, tight --
                         

           I'm gonna go find Alice-- you have
           to stay with Martin.
                         
          Charles looks at Martin -- can't argue. Says, sincerely:
                         

           ... you gonna be okay without me?
                         

           
           ... yeah.

                         
                         
          Charles nods -- Joe looks to Cary:
                         

           I'm not staying with the girls!
                         

           God, Cary. Shut up!
                         

           Calm down.
                         

           Oh, my leg hurts!
                         

           Come on, Cary, we gotta go.
                         
          Joe nods, determined, and he and Cary head off --
                         

           This is going to hurt.
                         
          Martin screams.
                         

           I haven't even done it yet.
                         
          Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood,
          many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone
          figures in town.
                         
                         

                         
          Joe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves.
                         

           So what are we doing here?
                         

           Just follow me.
                         

           I've been following you for the
           last five blocks. What are we doing
           here?
                         
          Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the


                         
                         

                         
          They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows
          CAKED WITH DIRT. Stuck. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows.
          Stuck. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked.
                         

           Help me!
                         

           Help you with what?
                         

           We need to get inside.
                         

           For what? What's in these windows?
                         

           Cary, help me.
                         

           It's dirt. Why is there dirt in
           these windows?
                         

           Help me, on three.
                         

           One, two, three.... One, two,
           three.... One, two threee.
                         
          The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one --
          two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS
          OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness
          they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN
          FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been
          DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED,
          caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their
          breath.
                         

           Whoa. This is scary.
                         

           You got any sparklers in there?
                         

           Are you kidding me?
                         
          Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER.
          LIGHTS it with a lighter and DROPS IT IN. The thing falls far
          enough to tell them it's too far to jump.

                         
                         
          But burning on the dirt floor of the nearly-dug hole, it
          lights up a TUNNEL at the bottom.

          A JEEP roars past.
                         
                         

                         
          Jack drives fast. Louis sits beside him. It's awkward. But
          not angry. Finally, vulnerable, scared and sad:
                         

           I came to your house that day. To
           tell you that I never meant to hurt
           anyone. Swear to God.
           
           I'm sorry, Jack. About what
           happened to your wife.
                         
          Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road. A
          beat. Finally:
                         

           ... It was an accident. It was an
           accident.
                         
          Jack glances at him. A small nod of forgiveness and
          gratitude. Louis wants to cry again, but just accepts it.
                         
                         

                         
          Joe begins CLIMBING DOWN the ROPE.
                         
                         

                         
          Joe lands on the bottom. Dark as hell -- looks up -- at Cary
          climbing down into the hole -- the barn roof looming above
          him. Now Cry lands too. There are THREE POSSIBLE WAYS TO GO.
          Joe's mind races about which way to go.
                         

           Joe, I don't understand--
                         
          We HEAR a DISTANT RUMBLING -- like something far off, but
          MECHANICAL. Then:

                         
                         

           Shhh. This way.
                         
          They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, a TALL OVAL

                         
                         

                         
          We're SO FAR AWAY, that the screen is mostly black, with a
          small speck of SPARKLY LIGHT.
                         
          They come to an area LITTERED WITH THE STUFF OF A LIVING
          ROOM. They look up: ANOTHER HOLE LEADING DOWN, DUG STRAIGHT
          THROUGH A HOUSE. They continue, coming to an INTERSECTION --
          where a NEW TUNNEL branches off.
                         
                         

                         
          There's DIM LIGHT from up ahead, where the tunnel BENDS. The
          RUMBLING/MECHANICAL SOUND LOUDER now. Joe and Cary slowly
          move forward -- seeing something off-camera that scares and
          amazes them all at once.
                         









                         
          They cross to the other side. Cary bumps into a HANGING
          SHERIFF PRUITT. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand
          on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt.
                         

           It's Sheriff Pruitt.
                         

           I know. Cary look.
                         
          Makeshift HANGING BULBS provide some light; a number of other
          TUNNELS are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the
          space in disbelief.
                         

           What is this?
                         

           We're under the water tower.

                         
                         
          Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt.
          Cary looks: THROUGH THE MASS OF METAL AND MACHINERY AND



          IT'S A HUMAN LEG. Joe and Cary would SCREAM if they didn't
          need to stay quiet. In a panicked WHISPER:
                         

           It's eating a person.
                         
          Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other
          side of the machinery -- and there he sees, in an INSET
          section of the rock-wall, THREE HUMAN BODIES, HANGING

          SHELLAC. TIGHT ON JOE as he sees, among them, ALICE. His
          heart POUNDS, his resolve quadruples. Cary sees her too --
                         

           She's here. We're going to use your
           firecrackers.
                         

           I don't think it's going to hurt
           it, Joe.
                         

           There are other tunnels.
                         

           So?
                         

           I need you to make noise. Lots of
           it, right here, in two minutes.
           Make it loud and make it last--
           gimme some sparklers.
                         

           
           -- why-- what are you gonna do--?
                         

           (takes SPARKLERS and a
           LIGHTER from Cary)
           Make sure you're gone by the time
           it blows: you can't be here, you
           gotta run.
                         

           Where are you going?

                         
                         
          But Joe's already gone. Stay with Cary, who opens his
          backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of EXPLOSIVES,
          glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view --
                         
                         

                         
          MOVE FAST with Joe as he races, a LIT SPARKLER giving him his
          light -- the MECHANICAL RUMBLING all but gone now. Joe runs,
          looking for another way into the creature's massive space --
          he finally finds another INTERSECTION -- he turns into it --
          he disappears down the tunnel --
                         
                         

                         
          Cary's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an
          OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN
          POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the
          entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space.
                         
                         

                         
          Joe races down the dirt tunnel, the SOUND OF THE MECHANICAL
          RUMBLING -- and its INCREASING PITCH -- getting LOUDER. The
          SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows --
          peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER
          SIDE of the space. He sees the creature -- then looks across
          to the lifeless body of Alice. His heart sinks.
                         
                         

                         
          Cary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his
          lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light --
                         

           -- come on-- damnit!
                         
          FFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying.
                         
                         

                         
          Joe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS

          Cary frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT!

          He looks up -- watches the creature GRAB AND PULL ALICE'S
          LIFELESS BODY DOWN FROM HER HANGING POSITION -- it moves with
          her to where he was eating the teacher -- Cary SHAKES THE


                         
                         

                         
          The creature PULLS AWAY the fibrous covering over Alice --

          Watching this is horror, Joe's about to run in just as
          BABABABABABABABAM!!! The creature JERKS UP from its almost-
          meal of Alice, looks toward the EXPLOSIVE SOUNDS, then LEAVES
          HER, quickly moving for the tunnel --

           Alice, wake up!
                         
          Nothing -- so he fucking SLAPS HER FACE HARD and she suddenly
          INHALES SHARPLY, he eyes WIDE, terrified --

           me? Are you okay?!
                         
          She's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed --

           How did you know?
                         

           Your dad. He told me. He was

          backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY. JOE IS

                         

           Okay, wait a minute, WHAT?!
                         
          Then, over the HIGH-PITCHED MECHANICAL SOUND comes RUMBLINGS -
          - like THUNDER from above -- and the three LOOK UP --
                         
                         

                         
          The kids round a corner -- ON MAIN STREET, COUNTLESS METALLIC
          OBJECTS -- ANYTHING METAL AND LOOSE -- has been INVISIBLY
          DRAGGED -- FLOATING -- toward the WATER TOWER -- at different
          speeds and with different personalities, metal objects BULLET

                         
          Suddenly, THE DINER WINDOW SHATTERS as a STOVE RIPS THROUGH
          IT -- we PAN WITH IT as it TUMBLES TOWARD AND UP THE WATER
          TOWER! HUNDREDS OF OBJECTS move past them -- from bicycles to
          silverware and sinks! DISHWASHERS AND TVS SMASH THROUGH THE


          TWILIGHT ZONE -- all things eventually SLAMMING into the
          WATER TOWER, the objects BEGINNING TO CRUSH TOGETHER, FORMING

                         
          BAM! BAMBAM! Sounds like GUN BLASTS -- the KIDS TURN: behind
          them are the RED CARGO CONTAINERS -- ONE BY ONE those cubes
          BURST THROUGH THE CONTAINERS: BAM! BAMBAMBAM! BAMBAM! And
          they SLAM INTO THE WATER TOWER -- AND THEY BEGIN TO FORM AN
          ODD, HUGE CRESCENT SHAPE ABOVE THE TOWER! Alice is cry-
          laughing at seeing it work --
                         

           -- what's he doing...?
                         

           ... he's making a model.
                         
          AGAIN and AGAIN, pieces FLY OVERHEAD, beginning to FORM WHAT

          FROM INSIDE as it continues -- ONE OF THE SPOTLIGHTS

          FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Joe
          LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers
          it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it
          out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the
          LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go.
                         
          Joe knows what this means. He looks up at his father, who
          also understand. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION --
          FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE
          NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING... TEARS
          in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go,
          but knowing he must. Jack, heartsick, watches his son, on the
          verge of letting go. Alice watches Joe, on the verge of tears
          -- except Joe just can't bring himself to do it, not now, not
          ever. But then something happens.
                         
          Pulled by the invisible force, THE LOCKET POPS OPEN. And we
          see what's inside. A PHOTOGRAPH of Joe's MOTHER. A young
          woman, HOLDING HER ONE SMALL BABY. And Joe looks at his
          mother -- and in this moment, she at him and Jack's eyes
          suddenly WELL WITH TEARS -- Alice, too, tears streaming down
          her face and finally Jack reaches out -- and puts his hand on
          his son's shoulder -- which was all Joe needed, really.
                         
          And finally... after all... JOE LETS GO. OUR SCORE SOARS AS,
          IN SLOW MOTION, the necklace SHOOTS ACROSS THE MAIN STREET UP
