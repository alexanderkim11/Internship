       MOM, BEVERLY, a trim, fortyish, pretty Betty Crocker
       of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and
       butters it. She waves cheerfully out the kitchen
       window to the passing GARBAGEMEN on the back of a
       Baltimore County garbage truck and then turns to her
       husband and children and expertly begins to serve
       breakfast.

       DAD, EUGENE, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by
       trade, divides the morning paper up between himself
       and son CHIP, a cute semi-hip kid who is still in
       high-school.  Daughter, MISTY, a pretty and slightly
       overweight college student, frantically prices the
       junk she plans on selling at the flea market after
       classes while gulping down a light breakfast.

                  Well, Dottie, how come they're
                  not here then, Fuck-Face?


                       

                       

       MOM giggles to herself like a little kid and
       immediately redials the phone.



       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN, MOM's frumpy, brittle, busy-body
       next door neighbor, is knocking on door, carrying a
       sewing basket.


                         
                  Beverly?  Beverly darling?

                  I know you are...



       MOM is laughing to herself listening to ringing
       phone while MRS. HINKLE, on split-screen, tries not
       to answer.  Finally she lunges for it.

                  Mrs. Wilson from the telephone
                  company.  I understand you're
                  having problems with obscene calls.


                       
                  Yes, I am...I'm sorry Mrs. Wilson..

                  changed my number twice already...
                  Please help me!



       ROSEMARY ACKERMAN walks through kitchen, wipes a
       finger on window ledge to check for dust and calls
       out Beverly's name.



       MOM doesn't hear MRS. ACKERMAN as she continues her
       phone conversation with MRS. HINKLE.


                   (Still the fake telephone

       MRS. ACKERMAN looks up at huge oil portrait of MOM
       in ornate frame hanging over couch and calls out
       Beverly's name.  Hearing muffled voices behind MOM'S
       closed bedroom door at the top of the steps, MRS.
       ACKERMAN begins to creep up the steps.

                  Yes, I did.  It's terrifying!
                  The police were at my house this
                  morning.


                  Who on earth would want to
                  harrass poor Dottie Hinkle?



       DOTTIE HINKLE, still angry and occasionally cursing
       to herself, digs in her prize flower garden out
       front of her house behind ornamental wishing-well on
       front lawn.  Subtitle appears: "2:15pm" and then
       fades out.

       Cut to MOM, driving happily by in her station wagon
       as she waves to DOTTIE.

       DOTTIE sees MOM, tries to look cheerful and waves
       back.

       Cut back to MOM who looks in her rear view mirror,
       sees she's not being followed and suddenly screeches
       car into a U-turn as MOM's "Psycho Theme" plays on
       soundtrack

       MOM's face turns to stone as ripple flashback
       effects dissolve to that fateful day in the mall
       when MOM pulled up to parallel park and DOTTIE
       HINKLE stole her place from behind.

       Ripple effects dissolve to the present as the wheels
       of MOM'S car skid to a stop.  The car door opens and
       MOM's sensible shoes step out as "Mom Psycho Theme"
       builds.

       MOM closes car door quietly, watches DOTTIE HINKLE
       up the street undetected and then takes the scissors
       from her purse and hides them up her sleeve.

       As MOM sneaks up street towards DOTTIE, intercut are
       obsessional flashbacks of details of the traumatic
       parking place incident;  MOM'S POV of DOTTIE pulling
       into space, DOTTIE'S maddening nonchalance as she
       snottily gets out of her car and trots right past
       MOM without the slightest apology, MOM'S sputtering
       face paralyzed with anger when she realizes there is
       nowhere else to park.

       Back in the present, MOM starts walking faster and
       faster as she sees DOTTIE begin to pack up her
       gardening tools to go back inside her house.

       Arriving just a second too late as DOTTIE closes the
       door behind her, MOM spots a can of gasoline near
       DOTTIE's lawnmower.  Thinking fast, MOM dumps gas on
       DOTTIE's mail in the mailbox on porch, lights it on
       fire and runs from the flames, happily throwing a
       coin into DOTTIE's wishing well as an afterthought.

       MOM walks as fast as possible back to her car, gets
       in and pulls off.  Smiling evily to herself, she
       drives by and sees DOTTIE HINKLE screaming in horror
       and trying to beat the fire out with a broom.



       Parking lot is filled and the few last parents are
       entering the building for PTA meeting.  MOM speeds
       into lot and gets out of car.  Subtitle appears:

       one-on-one meeting with another mother, who is in

       light of pursuing police car in rear-view mirror and
       floors it as she hits play button of tape deck in
       car and begins singing along loudly and scarily to
       her favorite song, Barry Manilow's "Daybreak",

       MOM is "dancing" in place and gyrating to the beat
       as she belts out the finale of "Daybreak" and
       suddenly turns the steering wheel violently to the
       right.



       MOM's car veers across lawn and flattens Mrs.

       shoes as he concentrates on her gigantic breasts and
       touches himself off camera.  He hears banging at
       door, curses whoever it is, and decides to ignore

       MOM zeros in on the game hens and flashes back to
       "Dede" and the other cute birds in her bird-feeder
       at home.

       As the couple viciously slice apart the game hens
       and stuff the meat in their mouths, MOM breaks a
       small pane of glass in back door to gain entry.

       stabs MRS. STERNER viciously in the stomach with
       MRS. ACKERMAN's scissors.

       MRS. STERNER opens her mouth in a silent scream as
       MOM pulls out the scissors and stabs her again and
       again as a large rat in the closet runs out and
       begins biting MRS. STERNER's ankle at the same time.



       MR. STERNER burps in front of empty plate and hears
       loud thud from upstairs.  He gets up from table.

       stomach and expertly throws them like a knife at MR.
       STERNER's head.  He ducks in the nick of time and
       the scissors stick in the wall.

       MR. STERNER turns and runs in fear as MOM gives
       chase, grabbing the scissors out of the wall.

       runs after him.  She throws the scissors at him
       again, but just misses him.

                  Blessed be God, Father, Son and
                  Holy Spirit...


                  And blessed be His kingdom, now
                  and forever.  Amen...

       The SUTPHINS take their place in a half filled pew
       next to appalled young MARRIED COUPLE as a still
       mortified SCOTTY glares in hatred and vengeance from
       a pew in the back of the church.

       BIRDIE's face is covered in tears as she sits with
       her parents helplessly.

       MISTY turns in her seat and searches the hostile
       crowd for the face of the cute REPORTER.  When she
       spots him secretly snapping her photo, she subtly
       gives him a sexy pose.



       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD wait with other COPS
       outside their cars as voice comes over police radio.


                  This is Captain Johnson from
                  Homicide.  Lab reports confirm
                  Sutphin latent print of index
                  finger on true-crime book matches
                  those latent prints lifted from
                  murder weapons.  Bingo, boys!
                  Bust the bitch!

       COPS smile in silent victory as they immediately
       spread out and approach the church.



       FATHER STONE is giving the sermon in a kindly tone.


                  ...Jesus said nothing to condemn
                  capital punishment as he hung on
                  the cross, did He?!

       MRS. ACKERMAN and MRS. HINKLE nod in pious
       agreement.


                  ...If ever there was a time to
                  go on record against the death
                  penalty, WASN'T IT THAT NIGHT?!...

       DAD gulps and lovingly takes MOM's hand as MISTY and
       CHIP look at one another appalled while MOM
       continues her defiant smile.


                  CAPITAL PUNISHMENT is already the
                  LAW in the State of Maryland!...

       DETECTIVES MOORE and BRADFORD and all the COPS begin
       infiltrating the church, taking places in pews and
       then moving forward to other pews closer to MOM.

       SCOTTY beams at police presence and eagerly scoots
       over to let DET. BRADFORD and DET. MOORE sit with
       him on their way to nail MOM.

       GUS and SLOPPY, the garbagemen, scowl at the police
       and look with loyalty to poor MOM.










                  Now, let us pray and humbly
                  confess our sins unto Almighty
                  God.

       As CONGREGATION prays along with FATHER STONE, COPS
       flood the church and move towards MOM.


                  ...Most merciful God, we confess
                  that we have sinned against thee...

                            CHIP and MISTY
                  ...by what we have done...


                  ...and by what we have left undone...


                  ...we are truly sorry and we
                  humbly repent...


                   (Praying piously, but beginning
                     to sniffle a sneeze)
                  ...so that we may delight in thy
                  will...

       A BABY in the arms of a MOTHER in pew in front of
       MOM stares back at MOM.


                  ...And walk in the ways to
                  the glory...
                   (Starts to sneeze and
                    catches herself)
                  ...of Thy name...


                  Amen!

       MOM sneezes and a hunk of phlegm flies out and hits
       BABY square in face.

       BABY'S MOTHER screams in horror at seeing her BABY's
       face and the entire congregation1 thinking she's
       been attacked by MOM, dives to the floor in terror.

       COPS draw guns and leap over pews as complete
       pandemonium breaks out in church.

       Just as DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD are about to
       grab MOM, GUS and SLOPPY punch the COPS in the mouth
       and MOM runs off.

       DAD looks for MOM in a panic and realizes she has
       vanished.

       CHIP cringes in fear as hordes of COPS surround his
       family until he is relieved to see that MOM has
       escaped.

       MISTY gives "dramatic" poses of "fear" and "horror"
       as cute REPORTER snaps her picture excitedly.

       BIRDIE escapes her parents, runs to CHIP, embraces
       him and together they take off.

       FATHER STONE stares out from altar in shock as
       worshippers scream and trample each other trying to
       get out of church as police try to restore order.

       SCOTTY, trying to be macho, fights his way towards
       front of church and for a split-second sees CHIP,
       BIRDIE and MOM running out back door of sacristy in
       escape.




       MOM blows a quick kiss to GUS and SLOPPY who beam in
       happiness at helping her escape.



       CHIP and BIRDIE are "hot-wiring" SCOTTY's car as MOM
       lies hidden out of view on back seat of car.




                  We'll show 'em, Mom,  We'll
                  go on "60 Minutes"!

       The car engine starts up.


                  Alright
                       
                  You're bigger than Jason or

                  Do you think I'll need
                  a lawyer?


                     
                  You need an AGENT!

       CHIP peels out.



       REPORTER has chased DAD and MISTY to their car,
       still taking pictures as COPS flood the area looking
       for MOM.

                  wife is missing!  I'm worried

       CHIP and BIRDIE hurry MOM from car and run to door
       of shop as CHIP fumbles for his keys to open up.



       CHIP and BIRDIE hustle MOM into the shop and lead
       her to the "Gore" section and open a door covered
       with violent video display boxes to reveal a small
       closet.


                  In here, Mom...

                  This is so silly.
                       

       CHIP closes door behind her and then inserts
       cassette into VCR and pushes "Play" button.  On
       video in shop we see "Leatherface" in "The Texas
       Chainsaw Massacre" jump out from behind a bush and
       hack up a male victim.

       BIRDIE lets in the first customer of the day, a
       middle aged battle-ax, MRS. JENSON.

       is SCOTTY who has been watching them all along.  He
       takes off on foot after them.



       A carving knife slices through leg-of-lamb on
       kitchen table.  Camera pans up to MRS. JENSON's
       happy face as she fixes herself a leg-of-lamb
       sandwich and exits to living room.



       MRS. JENSON kicks off her shoes, excitedly pops
       videocassette into her VCR and climbs into her
       recliner for a relaxing afternoon of video
       pleasures.  She takes a big bite out of her
       sandwich, twangs the remote to start the video and
       smiles excitedly at hearing the overture to
       "Tomorrow" begin over the credit sequence to
       "Annie", her favorite musical.  Subtitle appears
       "12:09pm" and fades out.

       "Tomorrow" along with the soundtrack.

       the kitchen into living room as she sneaks up on a
       singing MRS. JENSON.



       SCOTTY looks horrified to see a figure sneaking up
       on MRS. JENSON through window.



       MOM changes her mind, puts down knife and goes back
       into kitchen.



       SCOTTY sighs in relief.

       eyes light up in homicidal glee.  She leans down,

       room.

       recliner singing along with the finale to "Tomorrow"

       MRS. JENSON tries to struggle up from the floor but
       MOM hits her over the head again with leg-of-lamb
       and finishes her off.

       MOM zaps the off button and softly sings to herself
       in the sudden silence.

       CHIP grabs her arm and they run.



       MOM comes running out front, sees SCOTTY running in
       the other direction and charges after him like a bat
       out of hell.



       SCOTTY runs, looking over his shoulder, horrified to
       see MOM chasing him with a butcher knife.



       BIRDIE and CHIP run in fear across suburban back
       lawns.

       outside cooking grill as horrified HOUSEWIFE looks
       out her window at her, about to begin cookout and
       screams in revulsion.

       CHIP grabs BIRDIE and they run away.



       SCOTTY's convertible awaits him as he races towards
       it with MOM gaining on him with every stride.

       SCOTTY lunges for door handle, fumbles with key and
       hops in just in time.

       MOM plunges butcher knife through convertible top as
       he puts key in ignition.



                  THE !!



       SCOTTY starts engine as he ducks the repeated knife
       jabs through his convertible top.



       SCOTTY peels out, showering MOM with gravel.

       A van pulls to a stop.  Inside are two BURGLARS;
       one white, the other black.  They are surrounded by
       obvious loot: VCR's, cameras and silverware.

       MOM turns to them with knife.

       jump in.

       Suddenly SCOTTY roars by in his car with MOM in hot
       pursuit.  She sees DAD and family and blows them a
       lunatic kiss.

       The COPS flood the place.  DET. MOORE sees MOM in
       the distance, grabs DET. BRADFORD and they begin to
       fight their way through crowd after her.

       "CAMEL LIPS" incites the crowd from the stage to
       fight back against the police.

       SCOTTY is running toward stage in terror, looking
       over his shoulder and seeing MOM gaining on him.

       DAD gets caught in a mob of slam dancers and is
       lifted off his feet and tossed through the air by
       the crowd.

       MISTY, CHIP and BIRDIE see DAD airborne and start
       slamming into the crowd to save him.  MISTY and CHIP
       slam into big BIKER below DAD and DAD is knocked
       back to the ground safely.

       When BIRDIE sees a slam dancer with a trickle of
       blood running from his nose, she starts gagging at
       the sight of real blood.

       SCOTTY is at the edge of the stage.  He sees MOM
       almost on top of him and leaps onto stage and runs
       for his life, dodging bouncers and beer bottles
       being thrown from audience.

       MOM looks furious that SCOTTY has escaped but then
       looks up at theatrical light rigging overhead and
       then back down at SCOTTY's face as "CAMEL LIPS"
       tries to hit him with their instruments.  MOM looks
       over her shoulder and sees DET. MOORE and DET.
       BRADFORD advancing on her.  Ducking behind a giant
       speaker, out of view of the crowd MOM pulls butcher
       knife from purse, cuts supporting rope and sends
       whole set of lights crashing down on SCOTTY's head.

       The crowd goes wild thinking it's more of "CAMEL
       LIPS" sickening theatrics.

       A gang of heavy-metal chicks slam into DET. MOORE
       and DET. BRADFORD and knock them to the ground.

       still alive, crawling out from under the lights,
       semi-conscious and bleeding.

       BIRDIE faints at the sight of more blood.

       Thinking fast, MOM swipes a hairspray can sticking
       out of a girl's purse and uses her VIP pass to go
       backstage as CAMEL LIPS reaches its deafening
       crescendo of musical mayhem.

       As SCOTTY crawls to side of stage, MOM jumps out
       from a piece of backstage scenery and aims hairspray
       can at him.

       MOM lights the spray from the hairspray can and
       ignites SCOTTY's clothes in lethal flames without
       anyone seeing her.

       SCOTTY runs across the stage ablaze as "CAMEL LIPS"
       plays the final deafening note of their song and the
       crowd gives a screaming ovation, all holding up lit
       lighters, thinking SCOTTY on fire is all part of the

       horror.

       DAD gasps in fear.  MISTY and CHIP stare speechless
       as SCOTTY falls to his knees and keels over.  BIRDIE
       comes to and then faints again.

       The LEAD SINGER thinks it's a joke, pours a little
       Jack Daniels on the smouldering corpse and then
       jumps back in comic over-reaction when the flames
       light up again.

       MOM, now caught in the front row of laughing
       slam-dancing spectators, turns to her dumb-struck
       family, smiles and sticks fingers in her ears,

       something in his nose.




       JUROR self-consciously feels around his nostrils in
       embarrassment.




       MOM signals to JUROR that the problem is still
       there.






       JUROR blows his nose.  MOM smiles happily to him
       that the problem is solved.

                  woman!...

       MISTY and REPORTER are watching and move even closer
       together to snuggle.




       MOM's smile turns to horror as JUROR #8 on end of
       second row crosses her legs and MOM zeros in on her
       hideous white summer shoes.

       liberal defense attorney, as he paces back and forth
       before JURY wiping his brow.

       that says "Juror #8 is wearing white summer shoes!"

       Sutphin family looks at one another, shocked at
       MOM's change of plans.

       MISTY and REPORTER BOYFRIEND give MOM the thumbs-up
       sign as BIRDIE nervously flashes her the peace sign.

       A vindictive and hostile, DOTTIE HINKLE enters the
       courtroom and eagerly takes the stand.  As she is
       sworn in, MOM watches her with an evil smile.

                  Not at first, but then I
                  heard the same inflection in
                  a voice at a social gathering
                  and I put two and two together.

                  area inside "Hammerjacks"?


                  Yes, I did.  Scotty Barnhiil

       this mystery witness.



       MARVIN PICKLES, the pervert from the flea market
       bathroom has locked himself in a stall and is
       scrawling "I SNIFF JURIES' UNDERPANTS" on wall.

                  booth next to you?

       MARVIN sinks down lower in witness chair so he can
       get a better view up MOM's skirt.

       MOM suddenly realizes MARVIN is looking up her
       skirt.  In a brilliant legal maneuver she begins
       inching her skirt up a little higher under the table
       out of view of the rest of the courtroom, giving
       MARVIN a better view and hoping to change his
       damning testimony.
