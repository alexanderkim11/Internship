    a man in his 70s, narrates nostalgically OVER a MONTAGE
    of related news photos.


              1957 was a big year. The Russians
              put that Sputnik into outer space,
              the Dodgers played their last game
              at Ebbets Field, 'that guy' shot
              Frank Costello in the head, and
              missed, and the Gallo brothers
              whacked Albert Anastasia in that
              barber shop in the Park Sheraton
              Hotel. It was total chaos. With
              Anastasia gone, Vito Genovese
              figures he's king shit, but Carlo
              Gambino and 'Joe Bananas' both
              want to be boss of all bosses. So
              they call a meeting -- a big
              meeting.




    CREDITS CONTINUE. In FADED 16mm documentary-style, we
    see a country road winding through rolling hills. At the
    top of the hill, a black '57 Cadillac appears and sweeps
    through the peaceful landscape.


              It was the first time the whole
              commission was ever gonna meet
              face to face. Bosses and wiseguys
              were comin' in from all over the
              country, and all the New York
              families, too -- maybe sixty
              bosses, the whole wiseguy world --
              all headin' toward this little
              town upstate to figure out what's
              what.




    A sign reads, "Entering Apalachin - pop. 342." The black
    Cadillac speeds past the sign, then another black Caddy,
    then a black Lincoln, then another Caddy, a Lincoln, etc.


              Your father and me, we were goin'
              up with Tommy D., Fat Tommy.










                 He was running the family at the
                 time. Anyway, I don't know what
                 anybody was thinking, but some
                 asshole thought it would be a good
                 idea to have this meeting at Joe
                 Babara's farm in the country where
                 nobody would notice.




    A local state police deputy is gassing up his motorcycle
    when the parade of shiny black cars rolls by. He looks
    up and scratches his head at the unusual sight.


                 Turns out the local cops were
                 watching Joe Babara like a hawk.
                 So now you got about fifty Caddies
                 and Lincolns pullin' into Apalachin
                 and some deputy sheriff with cow
                 shit on his shoes notices all the
                 traffic and calls the Feds.




    The Caddies and Lincolns are all parked around a rambling
    country manor. Bosses and wiseguys are meeting and
    greeting each other on the big front porch.

    One WISEGUY is trying to shoo a cow away from his car.


                 You wanna be a ribeye?   Get away
                 from the fuckin' car.




    Federal agents start moving in quietly, heavily-armed,
    wearing big FBI arm bands.


                 The meeting never even got
                 started. The Feds moved in --




    Agents with weapons drawn charge the house and start
    breaking down the front door.






               -- and we moved out.

     Gangsters in shiny suits are squeezing through windows
     and leaping off balconies.




     fleeing into the surrounding woods and fields.


               Your papa and me hid in a field
               with hay or corn, some kinda
               foliage, I don't know.




     Two wiseguys in suits crouch in the tall grass.
     Suddenly they see a John Deere harvester bearing down on
     them.


               Then along comes this farmer who
               almost runs us over in a tractor,
               so your father hauls out his piece,
               this .44 cannon he used to carry,
               and hijacks the goddamn tractor.
               Funniest fuckin' thing I ever saw.




     The farmer goes flying off the harvester and the two
     wiseguys drive off on it.

     The farmer looks up to see the John Deere disappear in a
     swirling cloud of dust that FILLS the SCREEN.








     on top of an espresso. PULL BACK as a hand reaches in
     and runs a lemon rind along the rim of the cup. The
     espresso is picked up and sipped by MANETTA, the aging
     boss of a prominent New York crime family.









     The place is nearly empty. Manetta is talking to PAUL
     VITTI, a dark, intense, intelligent man in his late
     forties, and a powerful boss in his own right.


                  Anyway, Carlo Gambino came out of
                  it capo de tutti capi, and that
                  was the last time the whole
                  commission tried to meet -- until
                  now.


                         
                  I don't know. I don't like it.
                  What do we need a meeting for?
                  Let everybody worry about their
                  own business.

     They finish eating.


                  The '57 meeting was about how we
                  were going to divide up the whole
                  country. This meeting is about
                  how we're gonna survive. You got
                  'made' guys informing for the
                  Feds; bosses going to jail;
                  everybody's dealing drugs; people
                  are getting whacked without
                  permission. And on top of
                  everything, now we got the Chinese
                  Triads and these crazy Russians to
                  deal with. Everything's changing.
                  We need a leader. Someone with
                  fresh ideas. Someone like you.
                  It's gonna be a new century, Paul.
                  We gotta change with the times.


                  What are we gonna get, a fuckin'
                  web site?


                  You remember what else happened in
                  1957, Paul?


                  Yeah, I remember.


                  When your father died, I promised
                  him I'd always look out for you.
                  Come to the meeting.






     They get up to leave. Vitti drops some money on the
     table. Bodyguards follow them to the door. The waiters
     and the owner bow to them as they pass. They are almost
     out the door when Vitti hesitates.


                  Wait a second. I'm just gonna
                  grab a toothpick.

     The instant he steps back inside, Manetta and his
     bodyguard are struck by an incredible VOLLEY of GUNFIRE,
     which BLOWS OUT all the GLASS in the DOOR and WINDOWS.

     Vitti's bodyguard, JELLY, grabs him and throws him behind
     the counter, shielding him with his body.

     Outside, the shooting has stopped and curious bystanders
     are looking in the broken windows. Vitti's eyes well up
     with tears.






     being pulled out of a box. CAROLINE, a woman in her
     early thirties, dabs at her eyes with the tissue. She's
     sitting on the couch in --




     The office is warm, comfortable, and nicely decorated.


                         
                  I kept telling him that I needed
                  room to grow and find myself as a
                  person. Not just as a woman but
                  as an independent entity.



     her therapist, seems to be listening intently.


                  I told him I needed to get in
                  touch with my uniqueness, but he
                  couldn't handle that. He said I
                  was driving him away. Do you
                  think I was driving him away, Dr.
                  Sobol?

     Ben leans forward sympathetically.







     He's in his mid-forties, has an expressive face and a
     quick wit, and despite the occasional lapse, he is a
     gifted and caring psychologist.


                  Things end, Caroline. That's just
                  a part of life. It's how we deal
                  with things ending that's important.


                  I just can't believe it's over between
                  me and Steve. Maybe there's still
                  hope.


                  Well, he did take out a restraining
                  order against you. I have to be
                  honest, that's usually not a good
                  sign.


                  But what should I do?


                  Well, Caroline, I think the first
                  thing you have to do...
                         
                  ... is stop whining about this
                  pathetic loser! You're a tragedy
                  queen!
                         
                  'Steve doesn't respect me. Steve
                  doesn't love me anymore.' Who gives
                  a shit! Get a fucking life! You
                  are, without a doubt, the most
                  boring human being I have ever met!
                  Please, say something interesting
                  before I lapse into a goddamn coma!

     Caroline looks curiously at Ben, unperturbed.


                  Dr. Sobol?




     Lost in his fantasy, not really listening.    He comes
     to attention and tries to cover.








                  Yes. Yes. I was just reflecting
                  on your whole -- situation. It's
                  very interesting what you were
                  just saying. I want you to think
                  about it, and I'm going to think
                  about it, so we'll both think
                  about it and we'll continue next
                  week when I get back from my
                  vacation.

     Caroline bursts into tears again.


                  Or not.






     Ben rushes upstairs and into his bedroom. His 14-year-old
     son MICHAEL is in his room putting on a tuxedo.


                  You're late.


                         
                  I know. I couldn't get rid of my
                  last patient. I think she was a
                  tick in a past life.


                  Yeah, what's Caroline's problem?
                  Your boyfriend's gone, he hates
                  your guts, get over it.


                  Michael! What did I tell you?
                  You can't listen to my sessions!
                  It's private stuff.


                  I can't help it. I hear you
                  through the vent in my room.


                  Funny how that happens when you
                  lie on the floor and put your ear
                  up against it.








                  Okay, okay. How's that guy who
                  dreams about shitting trout?


                         (entering, putting
                          on his tux shirt)
                  Fine. He moved up to striped
                  bass. Put on your cummerbund.
                  Boy, have you grown. Did your
                  mother move next door to a
                  nuclear power plant?


                         (struggling with the
                          cummerbund)
                  Why do we have to wear rented
                  clothes to Grandpa's party? This
                  blows.


                         
                  We have to dress up because
                  Grandpa can't have a good time
                  unless everyone else is extremely
                  uncomfortable.
                         (looks at Michael
                          and makes a quick
                          decision)
                  Forget the tux. Regular clothes.

     Ben exits, pulling off the tux shirt.


                         (taking off his
                          tux shirt)
                  Are you ambivalent about Grandpa
                  Isaac?


                         
                  Ambivalent? Where do you get that stuff?


                  Mom.


                         
                  She's not supposed to do that, you
                  know.









                  Your mother and I, when we
                  got divorced, we agreed we wouldn't
                  put you in the middle, or use you
                  as a go-between to talk about each
                  other. So just do me a favor and
                  tell your mother to shut her big
                  mouth.
                         (comes back into
                          Michael's room)
                  Did she say anything about me
                  getting married again? I think
                  she could be feeling a little anger
                  about it.


                  Oh, yeah. She really cares. She
                  says you're intimidated by women
                  your own age, and that's why you
                  go for these young babes.


                         
                  Okay. Listen, for two seconds,
                  pretend I'm not your father.
                  I'm just some guy, okay?


                  You gonna vent?


                  Yeah.
                         
                  I hate her! I really hate her!
                         (a beat, then
                          brightly)
                  Okay. Dad again. Let's go.






     Paul Vitti gets out of his car and walks to the warehouse
     with his most trusted soldier, Jelly, a hulking bruiser,
     and his sidekick JIMMY, a tightly-wound ferret with chips
     on both shoulders.


                  So what did you find out?








                          
                   The word is Primo Sindone must have
                   ordered it, but, uh --

      He hesitates.


                   What?

      Jelly looks at Jimmy.


                   What?


                          
                   A lot of people think you set him
                   up.


                   Why the fuck would I want to kill
                   Dominic? He was like a father to
                   me.


                   So you could be the big boss.
                   Everybody figures you're lookin'
                   to wipe out the competition before
                   the big meeting.


                   Oh, is that what they figure?


                   It's alright with me if you did --


                   I didn't kill him! I told you
                   that! Don't you hear?






      They enter a room where other Vitti family soldiers,
      EDDIE COKES, TUNA, and JOHNNY BIGS are waiting. In the
      middle of the room, a young rat named NICKY SHIVERS is
      tied to a chair under a strong overhead light. When he
      speaks, we get a hint of mental incompetence.








                   Please, Mr. Vitti, I told 'em I
                   don't know anything but they don't
                   believe me 'cause that one time I
                   said Little Joe hit Dukey and it
                   turned out he didn't but I didn't
                   know because --


                          
                   Shut the fuck up!

      Nicky goes suddenly quiet. He watches in terror as Jimmy
      steps aside and Vitti moves close holding a short length
      of lead pipe.


                   Nicky, you know me, right?


                   Yeah.   You're Mr. Vitti.


                   And you know what I'm gonna do to
                   you if you lie to me, right?


                   Uh, you're gonna crack me on the
                   head with that pipe?


                          
                   It's a rhetorical question, you
                   fuckin' idiot.


                   I'm only gonna ask you this one
                   time. Who killed Dominic Manetta?


                   I don't know.


                          
                   Don't fuckin' lie to me!


                          
                   Honest to God, I don't know!


                   You little rat bastard...







      Vitti winds up to brain him with the pipe. They all
      wince in anticipation of the blow. But Vitti just
      freezes there with his arm upraised. Then he drops his
      arm and seems to sag.


                   Forget about it. He doesn't know
                   anything.

      He tosses the pipe aside.


                   Get him outta here.

      Jimmy looks at Jelly in surprise.




      Ben is driving to the party with Michael. Sitting in
      stopped traffic, he checks his mirrors anxiously.


                          (to himself,
                           urgently)
                   Look at this. Everybody's nuts.
                   Ooh, I hate walking into that
                   house late.


                   I think you're reacting like this
                   because you're mad we have to
                   go to this party.


                   No. Don't. I'm not going to be
                   analyzed by someone who up until
                   a few years ago believed in
                   Santa. Sorry, but we only have
                   room for one Dr. Sobol in this
                   family.


                   But there's two Dr. Sobols.
                   There's you and Grandpa.


                          
                   Can we talk about something else?


                   Are you going to read Grandpa's
                   new book? Mom says you won't
                   because you're...








                  Does your mother talk about
                  anything else or is it just me
                  twenty-four hours a day?

     Wham!   Ben REAR-ENDS the CAR in front of them.


                  That's your mother's fault!   Your
                  mother did that! Damn!






     The minivan has rear-ended a black Lincoln Town Car. The
     trunk has sprung open and Nicky Shivers can be seen in
     the trunk, bound and gagged, kicking and squirming.
     Muffled shouts can be heard through the duct tape over
     his mouth.

     Jelly and Jimmy jump out of the Lincoln and slam the top
     of the trunk just as Ben gets out of the minivan to
     inspect the damage.


                         
                  What's the matter with you?   Are
                  you some kind of moron?


                  I'm sorry.   It's totally my fault.

     Ben looks at the damage. The Lincoln has gotten the
     worst of it. The rear bumper is hanging off, and Jelly
     is struggling to latch the trunk.


                  Did you see anything?


                  I was talking to my son.   I took
                  my eyes off the road --


                  Forget that bullshit.   Did you see
                  anything?

     Jelly steps in to defuse the situation, warning Jimmy off
     with a look.








                  That's all right, sir. It's our
                  fault for being in front of you
                  like that.


                         
                  Well, I should have been watching.
                  Let me give you my insurance
                  information --


                  It's okay.   Forget about it.


                  Really? It looks like your whole
                  rear end might be screwed up.

     Jimmy is reattaching the rear bumper and securing the
     trunk lid with duct tape.


                  No, it was like that before.


                  Maybe we should call the police?


                           
                  Why?    Fuck the police.


                  Right!   Fuck 'em.

     HORNS start HONKING behind them.


                  At least take my card. You might
                  look at the damage in the morning
                  and change your mind.

     Jelly takes the card and reads it.


                  You're a doctor?


                  Ph.D.    Psychologist.


                  A shrink. You talk to a lotta
                  nuts, huh?

     Ben hears KICKING from inside the car trunk.








                  Pings and knocks. Cheap gas.
                  Hey, how do those minivans handle?


                  Jelly!   Let's go!


                  Take it easy, Doc.

     Ben looks totally confused as Jelly hustles back to his
     car.






     Ben's father, at the piano in the spacious, elegant,
     tastefully-decorated living room, surrounded by adoring
     guests, playing and singing an exuberant rendition of
     "You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby." Isaac is a silver-
     haired patrician, overloaded with self-esteem.


                         (ending the sing-
                          along)
                  All right, neurotics only! Well,
                  you must have been a beautiful
                  ba-a-by, 'cause baby look at you
                  now, thank God for Prozac, baby
                  look at you now!




     standing off to the side talking to Ben's mother DOROTHY.
     In the corner is a large advertising display featuring
     Isaac's smiling picture on the front cover of his new
     book, Tell Me What You Feel, Tell Me What You Want.


                  What do you mean you're not
                  coming? It's my wedding.


                  We understand it's a special day
                  for you, Benny, but your father
                  and I can't just pick up and
                  leave town every time you decide
                  to get married.








                  Every time? This is a once-in-a-
                  -- twice-in-a-lifetime thing.

     Isaac joins them.


                  Dad, you're not coming to my
                  wedding?


                  We want to be there, but I have
                  three book signings next weekend.
                  I can't piss off these big book
                  stores. If I cancel, they'll
                  stick me down on the bottom shelf.
                  That's how they are.


                  Yeah, that's the word on the
                  street. The self-help book
                  business is full of vindictive
                  pricks.


                          
                  Ben!   The language.


                  I'm sorry, but I've been alone
                  for eight years, now I've finally
                  met someone I want to spend the
                  rest of my life with and I would
                  really like you to meet her
                  before we get married. You're
                  going to be her family. I think
                  it's better she knows that up
                  front.


                  You're really hostile tonight.


                  I'm joking.


                         
                  I think I'll go talk to the mayor.


                  The mayor's here?


                  I can only hope.







     Dorothy exits.


                  What's wrong?


                  Nothing.   Everything's fine.


                  How's your practice?


                  It's great. Just great. I've got
                  some very interesting patients --
                  extremely interesting.
                  Fascinating actually.


                  Dad has a patient who dreams he
                  shits trout.


                  Thanks, Mike.


                  Excuse us, Michael.

     Isaac pulls Ben into the foyer.


                  Why are you wasting your time out
                  there in the boondocks? New York
                  City is the Mecca of Madness.


                  I'm just not sure I could spend my
                  life dealing with people whose
                  biggest crisis is how to fire the
                  maid.


                  It beats a guy with an ass full
                  of flounder.


                  Trout! And don't minimize my
                  practice.


                  Why are you getting so defensive?
                  This is about your own feelings
                  of inadequacy.








                  You always turn it back on me.
                  Why do you do that?


                  Why do you think I do that?


                  Why do you think I think you do
                  that? Go ahead, now you ask me
                  why I think you think I think you
                  do that.


                  Enough. I want you to think about
                  what I said. And when you're ready
                  to talk to me like a normal person,
                  I'll be at the piano with
                  Regis Philbin.
                         
                  Rege!


                  I'm not singing, Isaac!


                  Now, ladies and gentlemen, at the
                  piano, Regis Philbin!

     Applause and laughter from the guests. Ben grabs a
     glass of champagne from a passing waiter's tray.


                         
                  Thomas Wolfe was right. You can't
                  go home again -- because your
                  parents still live there.






     Vitti's men converse quietly while a soldier sweeps the
     room for bugs. He gives the "all clear" and SALVATORE
     MASIELLO, the old consigliere, speaks.


                  The Manetta family is asking a lot
                  of questions. They think we hit
                  Dominic.

     CARLO MANGANO, the burly underboss of the Vitti family,
     jumps in.








                  Forget Dominic! They were after
                  Paul.
                         
                  It's a miracle you survived. I
                  thank God.


                  Yeah, thank God. All I know is if
                  I didn't have some veal stuck in
                  my teeth, I'd be laying there with
                  Dominic.


                  This is all about the big meeting.
                  Primo Sindone wants to run the
                  whole show.


                  Yeah, but Primo's a boss. He
                  knows the rules. He couldn't go
                  after Dominic and Paul unless the
                  other families gave their
                  permission.


                         
                  If they did, we're heading for one
                  big fuckin' war.
                         (having trouble
                           breathing)
                  Talk to Zello and Baldassare.
                  Find out what you can. We got two
                  weeks. If the other New York
                  bosses are against us, I want to
                  know it before I walk into that
                  meeting.

     He feels a stabbing pain in his chest.


                  You all right, Paul? You don't
                  look good.


                  I'm a little choked up here.   I
                  gotta get some air.

     He walks outside. Jelly follows.     Mangano looks
     quizzically after them.







     Vitti is having trouble breathing.


               You feel all right?


               I feel like shit. This whole
               thing is like a huge fuckin'
               headache.


                      
               You havin' one of those
               mindgrains?

     Sweating profusely now, Vitti feels another stabbing
     chest pain.


               Get the car.






     Vitti is putting on his shirt. He looks considerably
     better. Jelly is sitting down, tapping his own knee with
     the little rubber hammer. Nothing moves.

     DOCTOR SHULMAN, a young cardiology resident, enters.


               Good news, Mr. Evans.   Your heart
               is just fine.


               How could it be fine? I've had
               like eight heart attacks in the
               last three weeks.


               Well, based on everything, I'd say
               you probably had an anxiety
               attack.


                       
               What?


               An anxiety attack. A panic
               attack. I can give you some Xanax
               if it happens again soon --








                         
                  Look at me. Do I look like a guy
                  who panics?


                         
                  There's nothing -- I mean -- it's
                  a common thing --


                  Where did you go to medical
                  school? I had a heart attack, you
                  quack bastard.


                         
                  Well, not according to these --

     As Vitti moves toward the Doctor, Jelly instinctively
     grabs the Doctor from behind and holds him while Vitti
     wraps the blood pressure cuff around his neck.


                         (low and deadly,
                          pumping up the
                          cuff with the
                          squeeze-ball)
                  Listen to me, jerk-off. I had a
                  mild heart attack and now it's
                  over. You understand?

     The Doctor nods vigorously, his eyes bugging out as the
     pressure around his neck increases.


                  If anyone asks you, you never saw
                  me, and I was never here. Is that
                  clear?


                          
                  Yes.


                  Good.
                         
                  Take the chart.

     Jelly releases the Doctor, grabs all the papers and
     follows Vitti out the door.







     Vitti and Jelly come walking out the emergency room exit.
     Vitti stops.


               Jelly, I need you to do something
               for me as my friend.


               Anything.


               You have to find me a doctor.


               We just came from the doctor.


               Not that kind of doctor.   I need a
               head doctor.


               You're gonna change your face like
               Sonny Black? Don't get his nose
               though, he looks like a pig.


               Not a plastic surgeon, ya spoostud.
               Do I have to spell everything out?


               It saves time.


               I need you to find me a
               psychiatrist.


               Wow. This is like the Psychic
               Network or something. I just ran
               into a psychiatrist. Actually he
               ran into me.


               Is he any good?


               Yeah, he seemed like a smart guy.
               He had a business card and
               everything --


               He had a card? That's a real
               fuckin' achievement.








                  What do you need a shrink for
                  anyway?


                  It's not for me. It's for a
                  friend. This friend is having
                  some problems, so I'm going to ask
                  the shrink some questions and get
                  some answers for my friend.


                  Got it.


                  And nobody can know. If anyone
                  hears I'm talking to a shrink, it
                  could be interpreted the wrong
                  way. You know what I mean?


                  Of course. Absolutely.
                         
                  Can I ask you one thing?


                  What?


                  This friend.    Is it me?






     Ben is with a patient, CARL ANDERSON, a high-strung
     milquetoast in his late forties.


                  Carl, I'm detecting a pattern
                  here. You seem to settle too
                  easily for things.


                  You're right.    I do.


                  No, well, there you go. You
                  just did it again. I suggested
                  something and you immediately
                  agreed.








                  You're right.    I did.


                  Why do you think you do that?


                  I don't know.


                  Well, sometimes people do it
                  because they fear rejection or
                  disapproval, but you can't let
                  that worry you, Carl. And you
                  can't agree with things just for
                  the sake of agreeing. Stand
                  your ground. Don't let people
                  roll over you.

     The door opens and Jelly enters.


                  Dr. Sobol?


                  Excuse me!    I'm in a session here.


                  Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.


                  You're... You're one of the guys
                  I rear-ended the other night.


                  Bingo.
                         
                  Get outta here.

     Jelly takes Carl by the elbow and lifts him off the
     couch.


                  Upsa-daisy.   You got a coat,
                  nutbar?


                  What are you doing?


                  He's leaving.








                  The hell he is. He's not going
                  anywhere until we're done with his
                  session.

     Jelly pulls a big roll of bills out of his pocket,
     removes the rubber band, and peels off a couple of
     fifties.


                         
                  I'll give you a hundred bucks to
                  get out of here.

     Carl looks at the money, then he gives Ben a plaintive
     look.


                  Don't take it, Carl.

     Carl looks back to Jelly.


                         (peeling off another
                          bill)
                  A hundred and fifty.


                  He's not leaving.



                         
                  Three hundred.


                         
                  You're not that fuckin' crazy.

     Carl takes the money, gives Ben the thumbs up and
     exits. Jelly follows him to the door and waves for
     someone to come in.


                  Listen, if you're upset about your
                  car, I can understand that. But
                  you don't just barge in here --

     Paul Vitti steps into the office.    Ben freezes.   Jelly
     crosses to take Vitti's coat.


                  You know who I am?








                  Yes.


                  No you don't.


                  Okay.


                  You've seen my picture in the papers?


                  Yes.    And no.    Sometimes.   Never.


                  Jelly, wait outside.

     Jelly exits. Vitti walks around the room, taking
     everything in. He picks up the phone and listens.          Hangs
     up.


                  Sit down.


                  Sure.

     Ben sits quickly on the coffee table. He crushes a box
     of tissues, then moves them out from under his ass.
     Vitti picks up a stack of CDS and looks through them.


                  Tony Bennett, huh?


                  Yeah.   He's my favorite.

     Vitti picks up an autographed baseball bat from Ben's
     desk.


                         
                  Mr. Vitti, I tried to give the guy
                  my insurance information, but he
                  wouldn't take it. Seriously, I
                  tried several times because it was
                  all my please don't kill me.


                  I was just gonna ask if you liked
                  baseball.








                  Yes.   Big Yankee fan.

     Vitti puts the bat down.


                  Mr. Vitti. Not that it's your
                  fault, but your friend, he
                  interrupted a patient's session
                  and that's -- not good. I think
                  this is a matter for our insurance
                  companies, don't you think?


                  I don't care about the car.


                  Then what -- ?


                  A friend of mine is having a
                  problem and he might have to see a
                  shrink, so I'm going to ask you a
                  couple questions. Do we sit?


                  Whatever makes you comfortable.

     Ben starts for his chair, but Vitti sits in it first.
     Ben sits on the couch. Vitti adjusts the cuffs of his
     shirt, and runs a hand down the crease in his slacks.


                  Okay, the first thing I gotta know
                  about is privacy. You must hear
                  a lot of weird shit in here. How
                  do I know you won't go testifying
                  -- not testifying -- but, you know,
                  talking about it to somebody else.


                  I won't discuss a patient with
                  anyone for any reason, unless I
                  know the patient may be a danger
                  to himself. Like if I'm concerned
                  a patient might kill himself...


                  Not fuckin' likely --


                  -- or kill someone else.







     Ben looks to Vitti for a response.    Vitti stares at him
     for a long, uncomfortable beat.


                  So who starts?


                  Why don't you tell me why you think
                  you need therapy?


                  I don't need therapy. I'm helping
                  out my friend. You didn't hear me
                  say that?


                  Right.   I'm sorry.


                  You guys are supposed to be so
                  great when it comes to listening.
                  You can't remember what I said two
                  seconds ago.


                  I'm very sorry.


                  I have to tell you, Doc, I'm not
                  thrilled with the level of service
                  up to this point.


                  Why don't you tell me about your
                  friend?


                  He's a powerful guy. Never had
                  a problem dealing with things,
                  you know? Now all of a sudden,
                  he's falling apart. He cries
                  for no reason. He's having
                  trouble sleeping. And then he
                  started having these attacks. You
                  know, can't breathe, dizzy, chest
                  pains -- like you think you're
                  gonna die.


                  Panic attacks.








                  What's with all you doctors and
                  the fuckin' panic? Did I say
                  panic?


                  Not panic. Dizzy -- breathing --
                  chest pain attacks.


                  Right. So the question is, what
                  can he do to make it stop?

     Ben decides to go for it.


                  I'm going to go out on a limb
                  here. I think your friend is you.


                  You -- you -- you -- you have a
                  gift, my friend. Go on.


                  Medication could help, but if you
                  really want to get to the bottom
                  of this, you're going to want to
                  get some kind of therapy.


                  With you?


                         
                  With me? Oh, I don't know. I'd
                  have to look at my schedule. I'm
                  very heavily booked right now and
                  I'm going on a short vacation
                  tomorrow.


                  Where you going?


                  I don't really share that
                  information with...


                  Where?


                  Miami Beach.








                   You know, this could be good. Just
                   getting that off my chest, I feel
                   better already. It's like a load
                   is off my shoulders. Thank you.


                   Well, I really didn't do anything --


                   You did something. The load?
                   Off. Where is it? Don't know.
                   You're good, Doctor. I'll be in
                   touch. But listen to me.
                          (leaning close,
                           menacing)
                   If I talk to you and it turns me
                   into a fag, I'll kill you. You
                   understand?


                   Could we define 'fag,' because
                   some feelings may come up --

      Vitti silences him with a wave of his hand.


                   I go fag, you die. Got it?


                   Yes.

      Vitti gives Ben a little pat on the cheek, then turns
      and exits. Ben is stunned.









      Ben comes out the back door of the house carrying a
      couple of suitcases. Michael follows behind him with
      his bags. They cross to the car in the driveway.


                   I hope you didn't leave any food
                   in your room. I don't want to
                   come home and find a science fair.

                   though.

                   So judging from the mob scene
                   around the pool here today, I
                   think you'd have to say that
                   there's nothing 'off' about the
                   'off-season' in Miami Beach this
                   summer. Now, on a personal note,
                   this is my last report for
                   W.V.B.F. I'm getting married
                   to a wonderful man and moving
                   to New York, so if you're up
                   that way, watch for me on the
                   W.P.I.X. news team. Thanks for
                   everything, Miami.

      Ben and Michael look at each other out of the corners of
      their eyes.


                   Okay. Come on. Give me a break.
                   I'm trying.

                  you're turning me down? What, so
                  you can spend more time listening
                  to housewives piss and moan about
                  how nobody fucks them right?


                  I'd like to go now.


                         
                  You see this? This is what I'm
                  talking about! I'm a dead man!

     Ben turns away and starts for the door.


                         
                  You call yourself a doctor? You
                  should be ashamed. A real doctor
                  couldn't turn his back on a person
                  who's suffering!


                         
                  All right.
                         (hands him a
                          handkerchief)
                  What happened with your wife tonight?


                         (wiping away his
                          tears)
                  I wasn't with my wife. I was
                  with my girlfriend.


                  You have a girlfriend? We could
                  do two months on that alone.


                  What, you're gonna start
                  moralizing with me now?








                  Okay. Do you have marriage
                  problems?


                  No.


                  Then why do you have a girlfriend?


                  I do things with her I can't do
                  with my wife.


                  Why can't you do those things with
                  your wife?


                  Hey. That's the mouth she kisses
                  my children good night with.
                  What's the matter with you?


                  Okay, okay. Have you been under a
                  lot of stress lately?


                  You mean like seeing your best
                  friend murdered? Yeah, I got
                  stress.


                  Well, based on what you told me
                  before about your attacks, I'd
                  say that's probably it then.


                  It's just stress?


                  I doubt if there's anything
                  physically wrong with you.


                          (brightening, pointing
                           a finger at Ben)
                  You.   You. You're very good.


                  There's a lot more to it --








                  No, you're right. You're right on
                  the money. I can feel the juices
                  rushing back to my manhood as we
                  speak.


                  Well, I didn't need to know that.


                  This settles it. You're my
                  shrink.


                  I can't treat you, Mr. Vitti. I
                  don't think you're really ready to
                  open up and deal with --


                  Listen to you. The honesty.
                  Nobody -- and I mean nobody --
                  talks to me like this. I'm ready.
                  Let's do it.


                  You don't hear the word 'no' that
                  often, do you?


                  I hear it all the time. Only it's
                  more like, 'No, no, please, no!'



                         
                  All right. I'm here for two more
                  days. When we get back to New
                  York, I'll treat you exclusively
                  for two weeks. I just need to
                  figure out what to tell my other
                  patients.


                  You want me to clear your schedule
                  for you?


                  No thanks, I'll handle it.   Now
                  can I go?

     Vitti throws his arms around him and kisses him on both
     cheeks. A look of concern crosses Ben's face.

                   Thank you.






      Ben enters.    Laura is sitting up in bed, pissed off.


                   What is wrong with you? I woke
                   up, you were gone, no note or
                   anything. I've been going out of
                   my mind, Ben. I walked all over
                   the hotel looking for you. I
                   almost called the police!


                   Okay, listen. I'm going to tell
                   you the truth. I had a serious
                   patient emergency.


                   You have patients in Florida?


                   Just one. He followed me here
                   from New York. I had to go.


                   Who is this patient?








                   Paul Vitti!
                          
                   Paul Vitti.

      A long beat.


                          
                   Oh, Ben.


                   I know.    But don't worry. It's
                   not like   he's a real patient.
                   He's got   this idea in his head
                   that I'm   helping him. It's crazy.


                   You're not going to treat him.


                   No.


                   Tell me you're not.


                   I'm not!


                   That would be too scary. You
                   don't want a person like that in
                   your life, believe me. I've
                   covered the mob down here. I've
                   seen what they can do.


                   Listen, it's been taken care of.
                   I told him I couldn't see him
                   again. He understood and it's
                   over.


                   You sure?

      Ben nods.


                          
                   I was so worried.

      He hugs her and holds her tightly, feeling like a jerk
      for lying to her.







     Immigrant garment workers cut and sew fabric.




     This is Sindone headquarters. A few of his trusted guys
     are in attendance: HANDSOME JACK, POTATOES, and MOONY,
     his consigliere.


               It doesn't figure. We take out
               Manetta, what does Vitti do?
               Nothing. Why doesn't he move?

     PRIMO SINDONE, a vain, pompous Mussolini, is standing on
     a stool in his underwear, being fitted for a suit by a
     nervous tailor.


               Fuck him.


               I'm telling you, Primo, he's
               planning something big. The shit
               is really gonna come down.


               Then let it come down. Vitti's a
               tough guy but a lot of tough guys
               got fed to the crabs off Red Hook
               over the years.
                      (looking down at
                       the tailor)
               You been down there a long time.
               Are you measuring my inseam or
               contemplating a lifestyle change?

     Sindone nods for the tailor to get out.


               Primo?   What about Vitti?


               Vitti. Vitti. The whole time we
               were growing up, he was the smart
               guy; I was the dope. My father
               was a nickel-and-dime shitheel;
               his father had it all. Vito
               Genovese blew it at Apalachin
               because he forgot to kill Gambino
               before the meeting.









                   I won't make the same mistake. I
                   want Paul Vitti dead -- now. You
                   two astronauts think you can handle
                   that?

      Handsome Jack and Potatoes nod their agreement.


                   You got it, Primo.






      A killer whale leaps up and takes it from between his
      teeth.




      The audience in the stands applaud as the killer whale
      splashes back into the water.




      are clapping.    Ben is clearly bored.



                          
                   Come on. Get into it.


                   I don't understand. They jump
                   out of the water, they splash,
                   they eat fish. It's not a real
                   stretch for a whale. If they
                   did a number from West Side
                   Story, then I'd be into it.


                   Just stop.
                          
                   We're having fun, right?


                   Well, to be real honest. I'm
                   not having as much fun as it
                   looks like I am. I'm pretending,
                   you know, because we have to
                   bond and everything.







      Laura looks at Ben.


                          
                   You've got to admire the openness.


                          
                   Here comes the whale again!




      The whale leaps high in the air and crashes back down,
      sending a wall of water flying into the first few rows.




      walking by the tank, get soaked by the huge wave.


                   Fuck me!




      Ben looks and sees Jelly beckoning him.


                          (to Laura and
                            Michael)
                   I'm hungry. Yeah, I'm going to
                   get a hot dog. Who wants a
                   hot dog?


                          
                   I'll go with you.


                   No, I'll go. You're pretending
                   to have a good time. I don't
                   want to spoil that. Be right
                   back.






      Ben confronts Jelly and Jimmy, who are soaked to the skin.








                  What is this?    Are you guys
                  following me?


                  Fuckin' fifteen-hundred dollar
                  suit. You think the whales piss
                  in that water?


                  No, I think they use the men's
                  room next door at the Burger King.
                         
                  Mr. Vitti wants to see you.


                  Is this a joke?


                  You're an employee of Mr. Vitti's.
                  That means you're on call twenty-
                  four hours a day just like the
                  rest of us.


                  No, he and I discussed this. I
                  told him I'd see him when I got
                  got back to New York.


                  Don't be a skavootz. It is what
                  it is. If he needs you sooner,
                  you go.


                  No, I'm not going, and if you
                  bother me again I won't treat him
                  at all. Understand? That's it.
                  End of story.






     Ben plunges into the tank in the middle of a school of
     sharks. He screams silently underwater and swims
     desperately for the top.

     A couple of families watching THROUGH the viewing window
     laugh and applaud as if it's part of the show.







     An alligator loafer steps down on it. We TILT UP TO a
     SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BOY with a shovel and pail.


                  Asshole.

     After a beat, a ten dollar bill falls where the
     sandcastle was. The Boy's face instantly brightens.


                  Thanks, mister.




     The alligator loafer belongs to Jelly. He's walking with
     Jimmy and other bodyguards who form a loose protective
     perimeter around Ben and Vitti as they walk along the
     shore. All the guys are wearing loud Jersey beach
     outfits.


                  They threw me in the shark tank,
                  Paul. The shark tank!


                  They were trying to make a point.


                  What, that you're a scary guy?
                  I get it.


                  You're in a mood, you know that?


                  Yeah, I get that way when a shark
                  tries to chew on my ass.


                  Okay.   Okay.   Calm down.


                  I don't want to calm down. My
                  girl friend saw me all wet?
                  I told her I fell into a tank
                  with the manatees. I lied to
                  her last night, now this. I
                  don't like it.


                  Manatees.   That's a funny word.
                  Manatees.








                  I'm glad you're entertained.
                  What's the problem?


                  Oh, I can tell you really care.


                  Okay.   What's going on?


                  I had an episode. Not an actual
                  panic attack, but I started
                  panicking a little thinking I
                  might have one. Does that seem
                  weird to you?


                  I'm redefining 'weird' on an
                  hourly basis. What were you
                  thinking about when you started
                  feeling anxious?


                  I don't know. The usual bullshit.
                  Family problems.


                  Which family?
                         (referring to
                          bodyguards)
                  This one?


                  No, regular family.


                         
                  I want you to draw a picture of a
                  house. In the sand.


                  What kind of house? A warehouse?
                  A whorehouse? My house? What
                  house?


                  A house.


                  Why?


                  I'll tell you after you do it.







     Vitti bends over and starts drawing in the sand.


                  This is good. I come to Florida
                  and draw pictures in the sand like
                  a jerkoff.




     TINO, a local Miami hitman, is covertly watching Ben and
     Vitti on the beach. He talks into a cell phone.


                  I don't know what they're doing.
                  He's talking to some guy. Looks
                  like Vitti is drawing something in
                  the sand... What's he drawing?
                  What am I, Superman? I'm a
                  hundred yards away -- I can't see
                  shit... No way, he's got that fat
                  Jelly with him and his partner,
                  Jimmy Boots. We could take him
                  out with a rifle and a scope, but
                  I don't have any of that shit with
                  me. My scope's in the shop...
                  Nah, it's a warranty item... Hey,
                  don't sweat it. You told me to
                  take care of him, I'll take care
                  of him... Okay, I'll call you
                  back.




     Vitti finishes drawing.


                  There.   You happy?


                  Where are the people?


                  What people?   You told me to draw
                  a house.


                  I know. But usually when people
                  draw a house they draw people.
                  Where are the people who live in
                  your house?








                  Well, you see, they'd come out and
                  say hello, but the whole family's
                  in the Witness Protection Program.
                  It's very sad. What the fuck you
                  want from me?

     They start walking.


                  Okay, forget the house. I'm going
                  to say some words, and you say
                  the first thing that comes into
                  your mind.


                  Good, more games. Shoot.

                  Love.


                  Son?

     Vitti looks out to sea.


                  Son?

     Ben can't see his face, but Vitti's eyes are full of
     tears. He wipes his eyes.








                  See this? Again with the crying.
                  Let's get out of here. We're
                  being watched. Don't look.
                  There's Feds on the roof of
                  the hotel.


                  How do you know that?


                  I'm a criminal. It's my job.






     FBI AGENTS STEADMAN, RICCI, and PROVANO CLICK away with
     long-lens CAMERAS as they watch from the rooftop.


                  Who's the new face?


                  I don't know. Get somebody down
                  there to see what he drew in the
                  sand.



                  Whoever this guy is, he must be
                  important to the family.


                  Maybe he's Vitti's new
                  consigliere. Put his picture
                  on the wire and see what you
                  come up with.






     Vitti, Ben and Jelly enter the suite. MARIE, Vitti's
     wife, and their children, THERESA, 14, ANNA, 10, and
     ANTHONY, seven, are there. Vitti greets them warmly,
     suddenly a different man.


                  Look at this, the whole crew.
                         
                  You all right? Good flight?








                  Yeah, we're fine. We're on our
                  way to the pool. Kids, get your
                  stuff. We'll get out of your way.

                  About this? I think she'd be
                  more worried about your career

                  That's an interesting fact I'll
                  have to remember if I'm ever on
                  'Jeopardy.'


                  So tell me about your father.


                  My father. He was a big man in
                  the neighborhood -- very well
                  respected. Everybody loved him,
                  God rest his soul.


                  He passed away?


                  No, I just like saying 'God rest
                  his soul.' Yeah, he passed away.
                  He died when I was about twelve.


                  How?


                  Heart attack.    Sudden thing.


                  Were you and your father close?


                  Close? Yeah, you know, pretty
                  close. I guess we weren't getting
                  along that great right then.








                  Why was that?


                  I was hangin'   out in the
                  neighborhood.    I had a borghata
                  -- like a kid   gang -- hooligan
                  shit, nothin'   big. But my
                  father didn't   like it.


                  You fought about it?


                  He slapped the shit out of me.


                  And then?


                  And then that night he died.


                  How did that feel?


                  It felt great! How did it feel?
                         
                  I don't know.


                  Well, think about it. Were you
                  angry, were you afraid? Sad?


                  Yeah, I guess.


                  Any feelings of guilt?


                  About what?   I didn't kill him.


                  I'm just speculating, but maybe in
                  some way you wanted him to die.


                  Why would I want my father to die?

                   my fiancee.


                   Nice to meet you.


                          
                   Thank you very much.

      A tense moment.     Ben presses on.


                   And this is my son Michael.

                   Whoa.  He's a bruiser.

                   You're a pound and a half soaking
                   wet. I've had lobsters bigger

                   You're Paul Vitti. The mobster.


                   Mr. MacNamara -- uh --


                   Excuse me. Is that polite? Is
                   it? I'm trying to be nice here.
                   Do I walk up to you and go,

                   Mr. Vitti, this is Laura's father.


                   Yeah? Okay, well, sorry. But
                   you should know, there is no mob,
                   and, P.S., I personally have
                   never been convicted of a crime.

                   That's right.

                   I heard about the wedding. Here
                   you go. A little something for
                   the bride and groom. God bless.
                   You should live and be well.


                   Mr. Vitti, we can't accept this.


                   Yeah, you can. Now, if you don't
                   mind, I just need to borrow this
                   guy for a couple of minutes, then
                   that's it. I'm out of here.
                   Okay?


                   Okay. Then you leave us alone,
                   right?


                   Of course. I wouldn't do anything
                   to screw up your wedding.
                          
                   I gotta talk to you. Come on.
                          
                   Have a great night, everybody.
                   Nice to meet you.

      Vitti starts for the door.


                          
                   I've just got to talk to him for a

                   I've never been less okay.


                   Great.

      Ben is yanked away by Jimmy.     Marie stands with Laura.


                   I bet you eat a lot of fish since
                   your fiance's in the business.

      Vitti, Ben and Jelly step out.

                to what we say.


                My ears are sealed.


                       
                Okay, listen. I had a really
                weird dream last night.


                I feel like I'm having one right
                now. How could you interrupt
                our party?


                You know, you're very rigid about
                certain things.


                Just tell me the dream.


                Okay. I'm asleep. I hear a baby
                crying. I go to the refrigerator,
                I get a bottle of milk, I take it
                to the baby, but when I go to give
                it to him, I see that the milk is
                black.


                That's fuckin' weird.


                Okay, get out of here!

      Ben starts to walk off the patio and comes face to face
      with Laura's father, Scott.


                   Mr. MacNamara.

      Ben exits. Scott MacNamara stares suspiciously at Vitti,
      wondering about his connection to Ben.

      Scott looks away, terrified, as Vitti exits past him.











      The sun shines brightly on the wedding day.       Guests are
      assembling for the ceremony.






      Tino, the hitman, arrives and saunters into the hotel.






      Jelly walks up to one of the bodyguards.


                   I'm gonna get something to eat.
                   You want like a sandwich or
                   somethin'?


                   Yeah. What kinda sandwich isn't
                   too fattening?


                   A half a sandwich.


                   Sounds good.


                   I'll be back in about twenty
                   minutes.

      The elevator arrives, Jelly gets in and the doors close
      behind him.

      The doors open and the Bodyguard turns to look. TWO
      SHOTS from a PISTOL with a SILENCER strike him in the
      chest and he falls to the floor dead. Tino steps out and
      drags the body to the stairwell.







      The guests are seated, Ben and Michael stand with the
      justice of the peace as Scott walks Laura down the aisle.
      The harpist is playing and all's right with the world.
      Scott shakes Ben's hand.


                       
                Nod your head and smile. Now, you
                listen to me, goombah. I know what
                your game is, and you'd better
                call it quits, because if you and
                your paisans do anything to hurt

      Scott crosses away.


                       
                What was that about?


                Nothing. Your father thinks I'm
                in the Mafia.


                Oh.


                Let's get married.






      Using a stolen pass key, Tino quietly opens the door and
      enters. He steps into the living room and hears WATER
      RUNNING in the bathroom. He stealthily approaches the
      bathroom door and draws his pistol with a silencer on it
      from under his jacket.





      Vitti stares at his reflection in the mirror, then starts
      washing his face. In the mirror we can see the door
      starting to open behind him, and the long barrel of
      Tino's pistol through the crack. Vitti blindly gropes
      for a towel and starts drying his face.




      Tino is about to shoot when Jelly comes up behind him,
      throws one strong arm around his neck in a powerful
      choke-hold, and grabs Tino's gun-hand with his free hand.

      Vitti hears the sounds of a scuffle, steps out of the
      bathroom, and sees Jelly struggling with Tino.

      Tino gets off a couple of wild SHOTS, but Jelly finally
      shakes the GUN loose from Tino's hand.

      Vitti picks up the gun and puts it to Tino's head. Tino
      shuts his eyes and turns away, expecting the shot, but
      then Vitti's hand starts to shake and he breaks into a
      cold sweat.

      Tino opens his eyes, sees Vitti frozen, and starts
      fighting with renewed strength. Jelly hangs on, looks at
      Vitti with concern, then wrestles Tino out onto the
      balcony.






      The ceremony is in progress.


                If any man here knows why these
                two people should not be joined in
                holy matrimony, let him speak now
                or forever hold his peace.

      A beat, then a SCREAM is heard from above, then Tino
      crashes into a buffet table in the b.g. Wedding guests
      react in horror.

     Jimmy and Jelly are hastily throwing clothes into
     suitcases. Vitti comes out of the bedroom hurriedly
     buttoning up his shirt.

               to the back and wait for me.

                  would happen.

                  This whole thing has been one
                  big disaster from the minute
                  you walked into my office.
                  We're finished! You hear me?
                  I am no longer your doctor!


                  Just 'cause of this?


                  Of course because of this! You
                  don't have even the tiniest shred
                  of human decency. All you know
                  is threats and violence and
                  that's all you'll ever know and
                  I can't be around that!

     Vitti stares at Ben for a long beat.


                  What do you want me to do?







     Sindone is watching "America's Most Wanted," rooting for
     the criminals. Moony comes to him looking concerned.


                  How come I can't get on this show?
                  This is a good show.


                  Primo. You got a phone call.
                  It's Paul Vitti.


                           
                  Vitti.
                           
                  Hello?

     INTERCUT Vitti and Sindone.

     Vitti is on the phone, struggling to contain his rage.
     Ben watches.


                  Primo, it's Paul Vitti.

                  Yeah, how's it goin'?


                  Not good. Whoever killed Dominic
                  is shooting at me now and I'm
                  having a lot of feelings about it
                  and I'd like to get some kinda --


                  Closure.


                  -- closure on this.

     Ben nods in encouragement.


                  What kind of feelings?


                  I feel very angry, you know. Very,
                  uh, enraged. Mad. Real mad.

     Thumbs up from Ben.


                  So why you telling me?


                  Why am I telling you? Like you
                  had nothing to do with it?


                  I don't know what you're talking
                  about.


                  Okay, whatever, I just wanted to
                  tell you how I feel because I know
                  that anger is --

     He looks at Ben.


                  A blocked wish --


                  -- a blocked wish, and I'm getting
                  my wish unblocked and I'm looking
                  forward to getting some
                  closure --

                    -- and if you make one more move
                    on me I swear to God I'll cut
                    your fuckin' balls off and shove
                    'em up your ass!


                    Vaffancul'!

       Vitti rips the phone cord out of the jack and smashes the
       phone against the wall. He stands there fuming. Sindone
       hangs up the phone on his end, worried.


                    Get a dictionary and find out what
                    this 'closure' is. If that's what
                    he's hitting us with, I want to
                    know what the hell it is.






       Vitti is still fuming.


                    Good?


                    Yeah, right up until the shoving
                    the balls. You can't keep doing
                    this! You want to get physical?

                    Hit a pillow.

       Vitti whips out a .9MM AUTOMATIC and EMPTIES the CLIP
       into a pillow on the couch.


                    There's your fucking pillow.


                    Feel better now?


                    Yeah, I do.

     Cheeky marble cherubs bathe in the soaring jets and
     bubbling pools of a large rococo fountain.











     Ben, Laura and Michael are staring up at the elaborate
     fountain that now fills the back yard.


                  Call the Vatican. Ask them if
                  anything's missing.


                  So cool!


                  Michael, get your bags out of the
                  car, please.


                  It's almost as tall as the house!

     Michael crosses away.    Laura glares at Ben.


                         
                  He felt bad. It's a wedding gift.


                  Well, we're not married, so I
                  guess we'll have to send it back.


                  Hey, don't blame me. You didn't
                  want to finish the ceremony.


                  What did you expect? You think
                  that's what I want to remember on
                  our anniversary? 'Gee, honey,
                  let's go look at the wedding
                  video. There's my parents,
                  there's your parents, and there's
                  the guy who plunged to his death.'


                  I just want to marry you.


                  I'm starting to think that's not
                  going to happen.


                  Come on. Next Saturday. It's all
                  set. I even asked for a room with
                  a low ceiling, just to discourage
                  the jumpers.








                  And who's going to be there?


                  Us three, a clergyman, and any
                  family members who've completed
                  their crisis counseling.


                  And no guests without necks.
                  Everybody has to have a neck.


                  We'll do a neck check at the door.

     They kiss.






     The back door opens and Ben, Laura and Michael enter,
     struggling with the luggage.

     They freeze. Sitting in the family room are the three
     FBI agents: Steadman, Ricci and Provano.


                         
                  Doctor Sobol, Mrs. Sobol -- I'm
                  Agent Steadman, Agent Ricci, Agent
                  Provano, Federal Bureau of
                  Investigation, O.C.D.


                         
                  Obsessive-compulsive disorder?


                  Organized Crime Division. We
                  need to talk.

     Laura recognizes Provano from the hotel and glares
     at him.


                  The FBI! This is better than
                  the fountain!


                  Michael, go to your room.








                  But --


                  Go!


                  Fine. I can hear better in there
                  anyway.

     Michael exits. On the coffee table are dozens of pictures
     of Ben and Paul Vitti taken in Miami and just about
     everywhere else.


                          
                  So.   FBI.


                  Can you explain these photographs,
                  Doctor Sobol?


                  I'm a psychotherapist.    Paul
                  Vitti is my patient.


                  Was your patient.


                  Right.   Was.   That's what I meant.


                  But not like a real patient.


                  Right.


                  So why did he send you that
                  fountain?


                  That was a gift to celebrate the
                  completion of his therapy. We
                  got our television from an
                  agoraphobic, so it's not that
                  unusual -- you know, maybe you
                  should discuss this with my
                  attorney.


                  Yeah, maybe you should.








                  Doctor Sobol, Paul Vitti is an
                  extremely dangerous man. We're
                  talking conspiracy, fraud,
                  extortion, racketeering,
                  grand theft, murder...


                  Well, yeah, but don't forget, the
                  man is a sociopath. You've got
                  to expect that kind of behavior --

     Ben looks out the window and does a double take.




     Isaac and Dorothy are standing in the yard, gawking
     at the fountain.





                  Excuse me, fellas. My folks are
                  here and I'd like to -- well, die
                  would be my first choice. Can I
                  go out?


                  It's your house.


                  Too bad you didn't remember that
                  when you were breaking in.


                         
                  Honey, maybe the federal agents
                  would like something to drink?
                  Could you see what we have?


                         
                  No.


                         
                  I tried, guys.

     Ben exits.







     Ben rushes up to Isaac and Dorothy.


               Hi!   What a surprise.

     Ben kisses his mother as she stares at the fountain.


               That certainly makes a statement.
               It's a little big for the yard,
               don't you think?


               What can I tell you, Mom? It
               looked much smaller in the store.


               Think it'll affect your water
               pressure?


               I think it'll affect the tides.
               What are you doing here?


               Your father and I are just very
               concerned about what happened
               in Florida.


               How was your flight home? Anyone
               hang themselves in first class.


               We got in last night, we couldn't
               sleep a wink. Is Laura inside?


               Yeah, but she and Michael are
               spending some time alone, you
               know, getting to know each other.
               That's important. I don't want
               to disturb that dynamic.


                      
               So you're not going to invite us
               in?


                       
               No.








                         
                  Well, I'm going to wait in the
                  car. There's too much spray.

     Dorothy crosses away.


                  All right. What's with you and
                  Paul Vitti?


                  Well, Dad, I'm not at liberty to
                  discuss that.


                  He's your patient? Are you
                  joking? Have you thought about
                  what this could do to your
                  reputation?


                  You, know, I always wanted to be
                  great, but then I realized that I
                  might have to settle for just being
                  good enough. Now I've got this guy
                  who's hurting and I'm thinking that
                  if I can help this guy, maybe I can
                  be a little bit great.


                  Jesus, Ben, you're the one who's
                  going to be hurting. I want you
                  to stop seeing him.


                  Didn't you read your own book?
                  Instead of trying to run my
                  life, why don't you just close
                  your eyes, take a deep breath, tell
                  me what you feel, tell me what
                  you want.


                         
                  This is bullshit.


                  You wrote it.








                  Okay.
                         
                  I love you -- and I'm afraid for
                  you -- I want you to be safe --
                  and I want you to have a good life.


                         
                  Is that really it?


                  That's it.

     They embrace awkwardly.


                  You know why I became a shrink?
                  Because I grew up with a great
                  one walking around the house.


                  I thought you became a shrink
                  because you were sleeping with
                  your psychology professor at
                  Columbia.


                  Yes, and because of you.






     Ben comes back to Laura and the Agents.


                  Okay, so you were saying?


                  Let me cut to the chase. Sometime
                  in the next week or so, the heads
                  of every major crime family in the
                  United States are going to meet
                  together somewhere in the New York
                  area.

     Ben nods, finally understanding Vitti's two week deadline.


                  We think the stage is set for a
                  major bloodbath. Has he mentioned
                  anything about it to you?








                  A bloodbath?


                  No. If he said anything about a
                  bloodbath, I probably would've
                  remembered it. Bloodbath is one
                  of those words that, you know,
                  stands out in a conversation.


                         
                  You could really help us out by
                  supplying information about that
                  meeting.


                  And if I don't?


                  If you don't, I will personally
                  make your life a living hell. I
                  want you to think about that and
                  call me at this number when you
                  change your mind.


                  You mean if I change my mind.


                  I mean when.


                         
                  Okay. Guess what, fellas?
                  You don't scare me.


                  Laura --


                  Sit down!
                         
                  There's going to be a bloodbath.
                  Oh, yeah. Only it's going to be
                  between you and me. You think you
                  can break into our home and
                  intimidate us? That ain't the
                  way it works here, boys. Whatever
                  he and Paul Vitti talked about is
                  privileged. He doesn't have to
                  tell you a thing.









                  Tarasoff vs. The University of
                  California. Look it up. Now, if
                  he's done something wrong, take
                  him downtown and book him.
                  Otherwise, I'll ask you very
                  kindly to get the hell out of
                  my house.


                  We'll be in touch.

     The Agents exit.


                         
                  Laura, that was really --


                         
                  Oh, shut up!

     Laura storms out of the room in a fury. Ben stands,
     looking miserable, then we hear Michael's voice from
     the vent.


                  You are in trouble.






     Vitti is conferring with Sal Masiello, his consigliere.


                  Paul, I don't mean this in a
                  disrespectful way. You know I was
                  a good friend to your father and I
                  will always be a good friend to
                  you. But the word is out that
                  you've been talking to a shrink.
                  Is that right?

     Vitti shoots Jelly a sharp look.      Jelly looks away.


                  What's the point here?








                  This concerns the whole family.
                  Right now, we're the only ones who
                  know about it, but if it gets out
                  on the street -- what then? Who
                  knows what you've been saying in
                  there?


                  It's none of anybody's business
                  what I say in there.


                  Paul, I beg to differ. If you're
                  doing this to establish some kind
                  of insanity defense later, that's
                  one thing. But everybody's gonna
                  think you're falling apart, and
                  that ain't good. They'll take it
                  as a sign of weakness, and that
                  makes us all vulnerable. Sindone
                  would take over everything.


                  So what do you want me to do?


                  It's time to end it.


                  What do you mean, end it?


                  Get rid of this shrink.   He knows
                  too much already.


                  You want me to whack my doctor?


                  If you don't do it, somebody else
                  will. It's the only way.


                  No. Nobody touches him. You hear
                  me? Anybody lays a finger on him,
                  I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?







      Vitti and Ben are walking down the street.   For some
      reason, Vitti is wearing a hat.


                I'm going to buy some fruit.
                You want anything?


                No, go ahead.

      Ben crosses to a sidewalk fruit stand and starts picking
      out oranges. Vitti leans up against a car waiting for
      him to finish. SHOTS are FIRED. He runs toward the car.
      More SHOTS are FIRED. Ben is hit. Vitti pulls out his
      gun but he fumbles and drops it. The gunmen run off.
      Ben sinks to the pavement, mortally wounded. Vitti kneels
      next to him and sobs loudly. He puts his hand to his
      head, knocking off his hat.


                Papa!   Papa!




      Ben jerks upright in bed, knocked awake by the nightmare.






      Someone dips their fingers in.




      It's Vitti. He goes down on one knee and genuflects in
      front of a big crucifix. Ben wiggles his finger in the
      holy water, just kind of curtsies and waves at Jesus on
      the cross.


                You look lousy. You all right.


                Listen, Paul, please don't send me
                any more gifts.


                You didn't like the fountain?








                  That's not the point.   It's a
                  boundary issue.


                  Boundary issue? I say if more
                  people gave from the heart, we'd
                  all be better off. Let's see your
                  watch.
                         (as Ben shows his
                          wrist)
                  Piece of junk. You're getting a
                  Rolex.


                  Don't buy me a Rolex.


                  Who said anything about buying it?

     They cross to the main aisle of the church.


                  Listen, I really need to talk
                  to you.

     Ben stops cold. A casket sits in front of the altar.
     A funeral service is in progress.


                  Tommy Angels. We grew up together.
                  Worked for a crew out of Jersey
                  City.


                  How did he die?


                  He was on his way to talk to a
                  federal prosecutor. Got hit by
                  a truck -- twice.


                  Do I need to know that? I'm
                  having nightmares as it is.

     The funeral procession comes down the aisle.


                  Last night I dreamed we were
                  walking down the street, I stopped
                  to buy some fruit, and they shot
                  me -- like Brando in The Godfather.








                   Good scene.    Was I there?

      A mourner walks up to Vitti, bows his head in respect and
      kisses Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti on both cheeks. Vitti
      gives him a consoling pat on the shoulder, then the man
      kisses Ben and walks off.


                   You dropped your gun, then you ran
                   over to me and started yelling,
                   'Papa, Papa!'


                   I was Fredo.    I don't think so.

      An older woman kisses Vitti's hand, then both his cheeks.
      Vitti whispers a few words to her, then she kisses Ben's
      hand and moves on. More old ladies kiss their hands as
      they walk by.


                   You're losing it, Doc.   You may
                   need therapy yourself.

      A man comes up to Vitti, kisses him on both cheeks,
      embraces him with excessive energy, then repeats the
      whole scene with Ben and exits. Ben looks at Vitti.


                   Him I don't know. Let's get
                   private.









      Ben and Vitti come out of the cathedral.


                   Don't you see? You called me
                   'Papa.' It's all about your
                   father.


                   What're you, nuts? It was your
                   dream.








                  Yes, but that's what your black
                  milk dream was about, too.


                  Uh-uh. I don't buy it. In my
                  dream, I'm bringing the baby
                  the black milk.


                  Freud believed you're everyone
                  in your dreams.


                  Yeah, well, that guy I don't need
                  to hear about. I can't even call
                  my mother on the phone after that
                  thing you told me.


                  Let's say you are the baby. What
                  kind of milk did you get from
                  your father?


                  Could we stop talking about my
                  father?


                         
                  That's the whole point! We have
                  to start talking about your
                  father. You know what it's like
                  dealing with you? This is you.
                         
                  You gotta help me, Doc. I'm a
                  mess. I'm in pain.
                         
                  Okay, Paul, I can help you.
                         
                  Fuck you. Nobody helps Paul
                  Vitti.


                  Very good. Now I'll do you.
                  'Boo-fuckin'-hoo.' I never said
                  this would be easy. Let's see how
                  you like it. Let's talk about
                  your father.


                  Let's not.








                  Is he still alive?


                  Yes, he's still alive.


                  What kind of work does he do?


                         
                  That's not important.


                  You paused.


                  What?


                  You paused. That means you had a
                  feeling. What does he do?


                  He's a psychiatrist.


                  Ooh, you're fucked up.   Next
                  patient, please.


                  We're running out of time, Paul.
                  Let's not waste it talking about
                  my problems.


                  Your father's a problem?


                  No!


                  That's what you just said!   You
                  seem upset.


                  I'm not upset!


                  Hey, I'm good at this.








                   We have three days left. If you
                   want to spend it screwing around,
                   I can't help you.
                          
                   Call me when you're ready to get
                   serious.


                   Say hello to your father for me!

      A cab stops at the curb.






      Handsome Jack and Potatoes watch from a vantage point in
      the park nearby.


                   We could just pop him right now.


                   In front of a church? What are
                   you, a fuckin' animal? It's a
                   holy place.


                   Is the sidewalk holy, too? I mean,
                   where does the holiness end?


                          
                   I don't know. Second Avenue?











      in the FBI van. A technician works at the computer
      console. Steadman listens.

      Through speakers:


                   You want me to whack my doctor?








                  If you don't do it, somebody else
                  will. It's the only way.


                  No. Nobody touches him. You hear
                  me? Anybody lays a finger on him,
                  I'll kill 'em. Is that clear?

     Then the technician plays an altered version.


                  You want me to whack my doctor?


                  If you don't do it, somebody else
                  will. It's the only way.


                         
                  I'll kill 'em.






     Steadman shuts off a tape recorder, having just played
     the altered tape for a stunned Ben and Laura. A long
     beat, then Ben looks up at the agents.


                         
                  What do you want me to do?






     Jimmy is parked at the corner watching the Sobol house as
     the three FBI agents leave.






     Masiello is face to face with Vitti.


                  Paul, he talked to the Feds.








                  I know this guy. He would never
                  talk to the Feds.

     Jelly's CELLULAR PHONE RINGS. He steps away and answers
     it quietly during the following.


                  The FBI was at his house today.


                  It's the truth.   I saw 'em.


                  You'll see. Next thing is he's
                  gonna call you and ask for a
                  meeting.


                  Come on.   You don't know this
                  guy.

     Jelly covers the phone and turns to Vitti.


                  It's Dr. Sobol. He says he needs
                  to see you right away.

     Vitti nods.






     Ben waits on a deserted corner in Brooklyn. A black Town
     Car appears and stops to pick him up. The windows are
     heavily tinted. Ben takes a deep breath, crosses to the
     car and opens the back door.




     Ben finds Jelly sitting in the back seat next to Vitti.


                  Sit up front with Jimmy.


                         
                  You want me to sit in front?
                  Paul usually sits in front.








                  So this time you'll sit up front.
                  Why you making a federal case?


                         
                  Federal case? I'm not making a
                  federal case? Let's go.






     A waiter pours red wine. Ben is eating out of pure
     anxiety. Jelly and Jimmy watch him intently. Vitti
     stares off.


                          
                  Wow, this is really good.
                  Delicious. I love Italian food.
                  I've never been to Italy but I'd
                  love to go. I've been to France.
                  And Jamaica. That's nice, but I'm
                  sure it's very different from
                  Italy. A whole different, uh --
                          
                  So what's everybody doing this
                  summer?

     Carlo Mangano comes to the table. Vitti gets up, hugs
     and fraternal kisses all around, then Mangano sits down
     with them.


                  This is Ben. He's a friend of
                  mine.
                         
                  Say hello to Carlo Mangano.


                  How you doin'?


                         
                  Carlo was on my father's crew.
                  He's always been like a -- I don't
                  know -- like a cousin to me.


                  I am your cousin.








                  I know, that's what I'm saying.
                  It's like a family thing. The
                  closeness.


                  Anything you need, anything I can
                  do for you, Paul, you know. I'm
                  here for you.


                  I know. So did you take care of
                  that thing I asked you about?


                  Is it all right to talk business
                  in front of your friend?


                  It's okay.


                  Yeah, I took care of it.


                  How about that other thing?


                  I'm waiting for that first thing
                  to come through. I can't move
                  until it does.


                  Did the guy give you a problem?


                  A little.    He's a lunatic.






     The agents monitor the conversation through the bug Ben
     is wearing. They shake their heads at the
     incomprehensible dialogue.


                  What did he say?


                  The usual.








                  Did you tell him you weren't going
                  for it?


                  What was I gonna do?





                  You always gotta nip that shit in
                  the bud.


                  Yeah. But if the first thing is
                  okay, that should fix everything.


                  Including the second thing.


                  Yeah, but --


                  Exactly.
                          
                  Don't repeat any of that to
                  anyone.


                  What? The first thing or the
                  second thing?


                  That's Stevie Beef over there. I
                  gotta go say hello to him for a
                  second.
                          
                  Come on.

     Ben watches Vitti and Mangano cross the room, then turns
     to Jelly and Jimmy.


                  Stevie Beef. Interesting name.
                  When he was younger they probably
                  called him Stevie Veal.
                         
                  You guys come here often?


                  Paretti's has a very special
                  meaning to Paul.








                  Yeah, this is where his father got
                  whacked.


                  Hey!


                  What's the big secret?


                         
                  Wait a second. Paul's father was
                  murdered?


                  Right at that table.   With his
                  whole family there.


                  Hey, just shut up.


                  Paul, too?   He was there?


                  He don't like to talk about it.

     Everything is suddenly clear to Ben.      He stands up.


                  Where you goin'?


                  Bathroom.


                  I'll go with you.






     Ben and Jelly enter.


                  I gotta -- you know -- poop.

     Ben goes into a stall, latches the door and drops his
     pants. Jelly combs his hair in the mirror.









     Ben hastily unbuttons his shirt, revealing a small
     microphone taped to his chest. He picks at the edge of
     the tape, takes a deep breath, then rips it off.


                  Ahhhh!




     at the urinal, reacts to Ben's cry.


                  You need more roughage. A bran
                  muffin in the morning would
                  help with that.






     Ben and Jelly rejoin Vitti.      Ben starts right in on him.


                  I have to talk to you -- in
                  private.


                         
                  Leave us alone.

     They exit without hesitation.


                  Why didn't you tell me about your
                  father?


                  What about him?


                  You said he died of a heart
                  attack.


                  So what's the problem?


                  What's the problem?   Your father
                  was murdered!








                  Heart attack, murdered, what's the
                  difference? He's dead.


                  There's a big difference.   Why
                  didn't you tell me?


                  Because it's private. You think I
                  tell you every little thing?


                  That is not a little thing!


                  Okay, you want to know? Analyze
                  this. I was twelve years old, the
                  whole family was having dinner
                  together right over there, two
                  guys walked in and shot him dead
                  right in front of us. Okay?


                  And you didn't think this was
                  important enough to tell me?


                  What am I supposed to do? Spend
                  the rest of my life crying about
                  the past? Forget about it.


                  You know what? I think you want
                  to talk about it.


                  No, I don't want to talk about it.


                  I think you do.


                  No, I don't.


                  Then why did you choose this
                  restaurant?


                  'Cause I like it, okay?

                   why this one?


                   White clam sauce. The best.


                   No, we're here because you wanted
                   me to know about your father.
                   You're reaching out to me.


                   I'll reach out to you --

      Vitti suddenly reaches over and rips Ben's shirt open.
      All he sees is a bald patch on Ben's chest where the bug
      was taped.


                   I think we have some major trust
                   issues here.






      The cutting room is deserted except for Primo and his
      men. Sindone is at his desk reading the entertainment
      section of the New York Times.


                          
                   I'd like to see a movie but
                   there's nothing out there. It's
                   all this shoot-'em-up action
                   bullshit. I get enough of that at
                   work.

      They all laugh.     Moony finishes a call on his cell phone.


                   That was our friend. He marked
                   your guy at Paretti's.


                   Yeah? Then let's make it the last
                   supper. Jack?

      Vitti, Ben and the boys come out of the restaurant and
      walk to the car.


                   Jimmy, you can have shotgun this
                   time. I don't mind.


                   Nah, sit up front. There's more
                   room for your legs.


                   My legs are short, it's fine in

                   Get in the front.


                   You know what? It's late. I think
                   I'm just going to call it a night.
                   Why don't I just grab a cab and
                   head on home.








                   Get in the car.

      Ben looks to Vitti for help.


                   Do what he says.


                   You know, we call this a
                   transference neurosis. It's
                   when the patient starts acting
                   out his problems with his therapist
                   instead of out in the world. It's
                   usually considered a good sign.
                   Not for me, in this case, but --

      Jimmy forces him into the back of the car.






      The Lincoln makes a U-turn in front of Paretti's and
      drives off down the street passing Handsome Jack and
      Potatoes in a car parked at the corner. The car takes
      off after the Lincoln.






      The agents are monitoring the bug, but all they hear is
      WATER RUNNING and TOILETS FLUSHING.


                   What's he doing in there? He's
                   been in the bathroom for half an
                   hour.

      Ricci and Steadman look at each other.







     The FBI van pulls up and lurches to a stop.






     Steadman rushes in, pushes open the stall and sees the
     microphone and transmitter in the bottom of the toilet
     bowl.











     Jelly's car pulls into a scrap metal yard and parks.
     They all get out. Jelly hands Vitti a gun.


                      
               Leave us alone.

     Jelly looks apologetically at Ben.


               Sorry, Doc.    It's not personal,
               you know.


               Don't kid yourself, Jelly. It
               doesn't get more personal than
               this.







     Jelly and Jimmy walk away, leaving Ben alone with Vitti.


                  You know why I have to do this,
                  don't you?


                  Because you're a paranoid? No,
                  actually you're a reverse
                  paranoid. You think you're out to
                  get everybody.


                  Don't bullshit me! You betrayed
                  me! You stabbed me in the back.

     They start shouting at each other.


                  I betrayed you? What are you
                  talking about? Who's got the gun?


                  You think I'm an idiot? Don't
                  insult my intelligence. You

                  Feds!


                  They played me a tape! You said
                  you were going to kill me.


                  Never.   I never said that.

                  It doesn't matter. I didn't
                  betray you, Paul. Yes, they
                  made me wear a wire, but I took it
                  off, because I think I know how to
                  help you now.


                  I don't want to know what you
                  think.


                  Yes, you do.

                  your father eating!


                           (after a long
                            pause)
                  Penne.


                  Good.    And you.


                  Ravioli.


                  The food was on the table?


                  They were just serving it.


                  Did you see the guys coming?


                  One of them.   Dressed like a
                  busboy.


                  Did your father see him?


                  No, but I knew he looked wrong.


                  Why?


                  His pants. They looked too good
                  for a busboy.


                  He walked over to the table?


                  I watched him the whole way.


                  Did you say anything?

                  My father was so mad at me.


                  And you were mad at him.


                  I couldn't say anything.


                  And then.


                  I never saw the second guy.    My
                  mother started screaming.


                  And you blame yourself?


                  I coulda saved him.


                  But you were mad at him.


                         (starting to
                          hyperventilate)
                  I killed my father.


                  You didn't kill him, Paul. You
                  were angry but you didn't kill
                  him. That's the life he chose.


                  I never got to say good-bye.


                  Say it now, Paul. Talk to him.
                  What do you want to tell him?


                  I can't.


                  You have to.   Tell him, Paul.


                         
                  I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

                  It's okay, Paul. You can let go
                  of it now.

     Vitti leans back against the car, slumps to the ground
     and starts sobbing, 35 years of pent-up grief finally
     finding expression.




     Standing around smoking, waiting for the death shot.


                  What's taking so long?   I'm ruining
                  my goddamn shoes here.   Fuckin'
                  $350 Bruno Maglis.


                  What's wrong with you? Don't you
                  have any respect? This is a very
                  difficult thing for Paul.


                  Shoulda let me do it. I'd be
                  home watchin' E.S.P.N.2 by now.
                  World's strongest man. You should
                  see these guys.




     Ben is comforting Vitti.


                  You couldn't save him, Paul. He
                  was trying to save you. That's
                  what you fought about. He didn't
                  want this for you, and you don't
                  want it for Anthony. You don't
                  want him to grow up the way you
                  did -- without a father.

     Vitti just cries louder.




     hearing the crying.


                  Jesus, the guy's fallin' apart.


                  Why doesn't he just pop him?   It's
                  embarrassing.

     Ben tries to comfort Vitti who is still crying.


               Your father's not dead, Paul. He's
               alive -- in you. And he's trying
               to tell you something.







     Suddenly, there is a GUNSHOT and a BULLET RICOCHETS off
     the TOP of the CAR.


                  Oh, my God!




     He OPENS UP with a MAC-10.




     Jimmy goes down, hit in the shoulder.      Jelly dives for
     cover behind a rusted car body.





                          
                  Paul!   They're shooting!

     Vitti continues to sob, oblivious to the GUN BATTLE
     raging around him.




     He FIRES back at Handsome Jack.




     He rakes the Lincoln with a BURST from the ASSAULT RIFLE.




     All the WINDOWS ARE BLOWN OUT by the GUNFIRE.     Ben
     screams.


                  Paul! For God's sake, shoot
                  somebody!

     Vitti just sits there on the ground, still sobbing
     quietly.




     He reloads and FIRES again.









     Jelly's last SHOT strikes him right in the chest, and he
     goes down.




     He sees Potatoes fall and starts moving out, covering his
     retreat with another BURST from his MACHINE GUN.




     Something snaps inside Ben.


                  Goddamn it!

     He takes the GUN out of Vitti's hand and starts FIRING





     He sees Handsome Jack emerge from cover and takes him out
     with FIVE QUICK SHOTS.




     He goes down FIRING, dead before he hits the ground.




     It's suddenly quiet. After a long moment, Jimmy rolls
     over and moans. Jelly goes to him and starts examining
     his wound.




     Ben stands up, still holding Vitti's gun.    He sees
     Handsome Jack lying dead on the ground.


                  Oh my God!    Did I do that?


                  No, Doc. That one's mine. You
                  got the Chevy Camaro and the
                  side-by-side refrigerator-freezer.







     Vitti emerges from behind the car looking red-eyed but
     composed again and looks at Ben.


                  Pretty fuckin' ironic, isn't it?
                  You can give me back the gun now,
                  Doctor.

     Vitti holds out his hand.      Ben hesitates for a moment,
     then hands him the gun.


                  It's okay. I wasn't really gonna
                  whack you.
                         (off Jelly's
                          skeptical look)
                  All right, maybe I was gonna whack
                  you, but I was real conflicted
                  about it. Progress, right?


                  I don't think I can see you
                  anymore.


                  Yeah, I figured.


                  This was big tonight. You might
                  feel a little raw for a while.


                  Yeah.


                  So good luck.    It's been --

     Vitti nods, they stand there for another moment, then Ben
     walks off into the night.






     ELAINE, a fortyish, tired-looking wife and mother sits
     on the couch across from Ben. Ben looks bored and
     depressed.


                  I want to please him in bed, but
                  whatever I do it seems like it's
                  never enough. Now he wants me to
                  say things when we're making love.








                  What kinds of things does he want
                  you to say, Elaine?


                  Well, he wants me to call him 'big
                  boy.' And he's my bucking bronco,
                  and I'm supposed to ride him hard
                  and put him back in the barn wet.

     Michael's laughter is heard coming through the vent.        Ben
     closes his eyes and sighs deeply.


                  Are you all right, Dr. Sobol?


                  Let me suggest something, Elaine.
                  If the man wants you to say things
                  ... damn it, you should get down
                  on all fours and bark like a dog
                  if that's going to get the job
                  done. Break out the wine, baby.
                  Smoke a joint. Do what you have
                  to do, because life is too short.
                  It's just too fucking short.

     Elaine stares, taken aback, then she smiles.


                  Okay.






     Jelly, Jimmy and Iron Mike arrive and walk up to the
     house. The rest of the crew are standing around on
     the porch.






     Jelly enters and finds Vitti in his undershorts, putting
     on his tie, looking very strong.


                  How you feelin', boss?   You need
                  anything?








                   No, I'm great. Never felt better
                   in my life. When this meeting is
                   over they won't know what hit 'em.

      Jelly gives him the thumbs up and exits. Vitti turns to
      the TV and starts knotting his tie as a PRUDENTIAL
      INSURANCE COMMERCIAL STARTS PLAYING, featuring a father
      and his son. As Vitti watches the sentimental ad, his
      eyes fill with tears.






      The sun is shining. A beautiful day for a wedding.
      "HERE COMES THE BRIDE" is heard.




      The crowd oohs and aahs as Laura starts down the aisle
      in her wedding dress. Isaac and Dorothy are standing
      near the chupah ready to receive her.


                   Is Ben going to step on the glass?


                   No. He doesn't want to hurt his
                   foot, so they're going to drop a
                   person on it.






      Laura and Ben stand before a REFORMED RABBI. The family
      is gathered again. Michael stands just to the side.


                   We are put on this earth to find a
                   love, a soulmate, someone with whom
                   we can create joy. How glad we are
                   today that Ben and Laura have found
                   each other, and we anticipate and
                   celebrate the years of joy they will
                   share together from this day on.

      We hear a PSST from somewhere.    Ben and Laura don't seem
      to notice it.








                   Ben, do you take this woman, Laura,
                   to be your lawfully wedded wife, for
                   richer, for poorer, in sickness and
                   in health, 'til death do you part,
                   so help you God?

      Another PSST. Ben looks over and sees Jelly standing
      behind some flowers to the side of the altar.


                          
                   No!


                   Excuse me?


                   No, not you.    I was talking to him.


                   Who him?


                   It's not important.     Yes.


                   Yes what?


                   Yes to the thing before. To her.
                   That's a yes. Pick it up from
                   there.

      Jelly moves closer.       The guests start to mutter.


                          
                   Doc, we're going to need to hurry
                   it up here.
                          
                   Hi, kid.


                   I do not believe this!


                          
                   Haul ass, buddy. We got a problem.


                   Who the hell do you think you are?








                          
                   Ooh, she's feisty. Watch out, Doc.
                          
                   Tick tock, let's go. Hurry up and
                   pronounce them, huh?


                   By the power vested me by the state
                   of New York, I now pronounce you
                   man and wife.


                   Okay.   Kiss, kiss --

      Ben and Laura kiss.


                   I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Sobol,
                   but duty calls, you know?


                          
                   Oh. You're the first person to
                   call me Mrs. Sobol.


                   Nice, huh?


                   No.


                   Laura, I'm sorry. It's the job.


                   Go.  Just go.
                          
                   Have him back here by the salad
                   course or you're in serious
                   trouble. Capiche?


                   You're a pistol.
                          
                   I like her.

      Ben kisses Laura, then the organist plays "Here Comes the
      Bride" as Jelly and Ben hurry down the aisle together.




      shaking their heads in confusion.












       Ben comes out of the function room with Jelly.


                 He's bad, Doc. Worse than I ever
                 seen him. I think his inner child
                 is all fucked up.


                 Have you ever seen an episode like
                 this?


                 Yes. Once on 'Bonanza,' Hoss
                 Cartwright got bit by a raccoon.
                 He got this fever and he was shaking --


                 Never mind.









       Jelly and Ben come out of the hotel into the garage area.


                 This is serious, Doc. If he
                 doesn't make this meeting, they'll
                 kill him for sure.


                 Can't someone else in the family go
                 for him? Tommy the Tongue? Louie
                 the Lip? What about you? You go?


                 That would work except for one
                 little detail. I'm a fucking
                 moron. I'm known for it.
                        
                 You have to go.


                 Me?   You must be a moron.








                    Hey!   Watch that.


                    You just said it yourself.


                    It's different when I say it.
                    When you say it, it sounds very
                    negative.


                    I'm sorry, Jelly, but I'm not going.
                    I'm not on the payroll anymore, so
                    forget about it. My wife is waiting --

       He turns to go back into the hotel.


                    Doc.

       Ben feels a gun pressed against his back.



                    You can't shoot me, Jelly.


                    Correction. Mr. Vitti couldn't
                    shoot you. But here's something
                    about me you should know. I never
                    got married, Doctor Sobol. I
                    don't have a hobby. I never got a
                    dog or a cat. I don't even have a
                    goldfish. I live for one reason
                    only, and that's to serve Mr. Paul
                    Vitti. He's what I'm thinking about
                    when I wake up, and he's what I'm
                    thinking about when I close my eyes
                    to sleep. If he told me to jump off
                    a tall building, not only would I do
                    it, I would hope to survive so I could
                    do it again and again until he told me
                    to stop. This is all I know. This is
                    all I got. So please don't think I
                    won't kill you, because I'd hate for
                    your last thought to be a wrong one.
                    You're going to that meeting.







       Parked on 50th Street, Ricci and another agent watch the
       limo emerge from the Waldorf garage. Ricci signals
       someone on the radio.




       flies INTO VIEW over Park Avenue and starts tracking the
       limo.




       The black stretch limo approaches the tunnel entrance.
       An FBI helicopter zooms INTO VIEW high above.






       Steadman and Provano track the limo from the air as it
       enters the tunnel.







       Fifteen identical limos emerge from the tunnel on the
       Queens side and start criss-crossing as they leave the
       toll booths, then head off in different directions.






       Steadman and Provo try to pick Ben's limo out of the pack
       of identical limos heading up the Long Island Expressway.


                        
                 Which one is it?


                 The black one.







       Ben is in the back with Jelly and Jimmy. One of their
       crew, IRON MIKE, is driving. Ben is putting on a suit
       of Jimmy's. He looks very anxious.


                        
                 Just remember. That's a fuckin'
                 $1200 Valentino suit. You spill
                 anything on it, I'll mess you up
                 good.


                 Shut up. You're making him
                 nervous. If he gets nervous and
                 fucks up, they'll kill him for
                 sure.
                        
                 Let's go over it again.


                 This is insane.


                 Mr. Vitti's been detained,
                 apologies all around, blah, blah,
                 blah. Then you say you're the new
                 consigliere, and you're prepared
                 to speak for Mr. Vitti.


                 Then what?


                 Then you just keep your mouth
                 shut, and hope nobody asks you
                 nothin'.


                 Boy, this is some fuckin' plan.


                 Shut up.
                        
                 If you have to talk, just be
                 vague. Can you do that?


                 I'm a psychologist.   Believe me, I
                 can be vague.







      Vitti is lying on the bed staring at the ceiling. Marie
      is stroking his forehead. Then he looks over and sees
      Anthony sitting in a chair at the foot of the bed,
      watching him with concern.


                Shouldn't you be outside playing
                or something?


                No, it's all right.


                How long you gonna sit there?


                       
                How long you gonna lay there?

      Vitti smiles.


                I'm done.






      The limo pulls into the parking lot of the Tops Limousine
      Service. Fifty other limos are already parked there.
      Jelly and Jimmy get out, followed by Ben, now dressed in
      shiny suit and pinky ring.






      Ben, Jelly, and Jimmy enter a garage the size of a small
      airplane hangar. The floor has been cleared and long
      tables set up to form a square in the middle of the room.
      Wiseguys with shotguns patrol the catwalks above the floor
      and soldiers are posted at all the doors.


                       
                I can't do this. I'm telling you,
                I cannot do this.


                Don't fucking whine! Whining's a
                dead giveaway. Come on! You're
                the consigliere, for Chrissake.







      Around the tables sit forty or fifty of the biggest
      gangsters in the world. A few captains stand around the
      perimeter, ready to serve their bosses.


                   These are the bosses? That one
                   looks like my Uncle Max.

      Jelly steers Ben to an empty seat next to Carlo Mangano.


                          
                   What's goin' on? Where's Vitti?


                   On his way.   Don't worry.

      Mangano eyes Ben with contempt.


                   What's he doin' here?


                   He's -- it's okay. Forget about
                   it.


                   Forget about it? What the hell is
                   that?

      Seated directly across the room from Ben is Primo
      Sindone. He stares hard at Ben, trying to place him,
      then leans over to Moony, his consigliere.


                   Who's the guy with Jelly?


                   I don't know.

      Ben looks away nervously.


                          (to Jelly, borderline
                           hysterical)
                   I can't do this.

      He starts to get up but Jelly pulls him back down.

      Moony stands up and gets everyone's attention.








                   All right, gentlemen. I think we
                   better start. We have a big
                   agenda, so for now let's stick to
                   the big issues. And it would help
                   if you identify yourselves when
                   you speak, since we don't all know
                   each other, and we didn't think
                   anybody would be into wearing any
                   fucking name tags.

      Laughter around the table.

      Sindone stands up and looks straight at Ben.


                   I'm Primo Sindone. They call me
                   Sonny Long. It's good to see so
                   many of the old faces here, and to
                   welcome the new ones from all over
                   the country. I see Frank Zello,
                   and Joe Baldassare, but I'm a
                   little disappointed to see that
                   the head of our other New York
                   family isn't here today. All I
                   see is his man Jelly and some
                   sawed-off little prick nobody
                   knows.

      Jelly looks at Ben, waiting for him to speak, but Ben
      just sits, frozen, looking down at his hands.


                          
                   Yeah, well, the thing is Mr. Vitti
                   has been detained and he sends his
                   apologies for -- being detained --
                   and he apologizes for his --
                   detainment.


                   Detained? What kind of bullshit
                   is that? What's more important
                   than this? As the host of this
                   meeting, I take his not being here
                   as a sign of disrespect to me and
                   to all these other men, too, who
                   came a long way to be here.


                   Mr. Vitti meant no disrespect.
                   The thing is, he's not feeling
                   well. He's sick and he -- didn't
                   feel well --







      Ben rises and slaps Jelly hard across the face.


                          
                   Jelly! We don't ever discuss Mr.
                   Vitti's health outside the family.
                   You know better.

      Jelly is stunned.    The bosses murmur.


                   All right, who is this guy and
                   what the fuck is he doing here?


                   In answer to your first question,
                   my name is Ben Sobol --
                          (off Sindone's
                           look)
                   -- leone. Sobboleone. They call
                   me -- 'The doctor.' As for your
                   second question. I'm here
                   representing Paul Vitti. As his
                   conser -- conghili --


                          
                   Consigliere --


                          
                   Don't you ever correct me again!
                   As his consigliere, I'm intimately
                   involved in all aspects of the
                   family business and I'm prepared
                   to speak for Mr. Vitti on all
                   matters.


                   Okay, Doctor, then let's get down
                   to business. Everybody knows
                   there's been this thing between me
                   and Paul Vitti for a long time.


                   Which thing are you talking about?
                   The first thing or the second
                   thing?


                   What second thing? I only know
                   one thing.








                   Well, I don't see how we can
                   discuss the first thing without
                   bringing up the second thing.
                   Didn't you talk to the guy?

      He tugs meaningfully on his earlobe.


                   What guy?


                   The guy with the thing.


                   What thing? What the fuck are you
                   talking about?


                   How should I know? You brought it
                   up.
                          (gestures helplessly
                           to the others)
                   This is the whole problem. You
                   can't have an intelligent
                   conversation with the man.


                   How about if I just break your
                   fuckin' neck? What do you think
                   of that?


                   It's not important what I think.
                   What do you think?


                   What do I think? I think it's a
                   good idea! Why would I say it if
                   I didn't think it was good?


                   I don't know.    Why would you?


                           
                   I wouldn't! That's what I'm
                   saying!


                   Have you always had a problem
                   dealing with your anger?








                   What are you talking about?


                   What do you think I'm talking
                   about?


                          
                   I don't know what the fuck you're
                   talking about!


                   See, you're angry again. Do you
                   feel you have to get angry to be
                   heard?

      Sindone turns to a couple of other bosses, FRANK ZELLO
      and JOE BALDASSARE.


                   What's he talking about?


                   I don't know. But you do have a
                   tendency to get angry a lot.


                   I agree, Primo.


                   I'm trying to talk about Vitti!
                   Why are we talking about me?


                   Interesting. Do you feel you're
                   not worthy enough to be talked
                   about?


                   What does that mean?


                   What do you think it means?


                   Fuck you!


                   Primo, calm down.








                   Calm down? How can I calm down
                   when this prick won't stop with
                   the questions?


                   Could you pass the fruit, please?


                   That's it!   You're a dead man!

      Sindone whips out a pistol and points it at Ben, but just
      as he's about to shoot --


                   Primo!

      All eyes turn.




      He's standing there, staring at Sindone, cool, clear, and
      unafraid. He looks like a king. The room goes silent.
      Vitti looks around the table, nods, and crosses to Ben.
      Jelly gets up to greet him.


                          
                   Wait outside with the car running.

      Jelly nods and exits.


                   What are you doing here?


                   Saving your ass. Sit down.    I'll
                   take it from here.

      Ben sits, greatly relieved.


                          
                   I'm Paul Vitti. I'm sorry I was
                   late. Those of you who know me
                   will know I meant no disrespect.
                   If it's all right with you,
                   there's something I'd like to say,
                   then I'll leave you to your
                   business.

      Ben looks at Vitti and sees a kind of serenity and
      clarity he's never seen before.








                   About two and a half weeks ago,
                   somebody killed my friend, Dominic
                   Manetta.

      He looks straight at Sindone.


                   Don't look at me. Everybody knows
                   you whacked him so you could take
                   over everything.


                   What I really came here to say is
                   that I've come to a very important
                   decision in my life. I want out.

      A great murmur of surprise sweeps around the room.      Ben
      looks at him proudly.


                   I'm going away for a while, but I
                   will respect the oath I took the
                   day I was made, and whatever I
                   know about anyone else's business,
                   I take with me to the grave. You
                   have my word.

      A negative buzz among the bosses.


                   As for my own organization, I know
                   Carlo Mangano would like to be the
                   new boss.

      Mangano smiles gratefully.


                   Thank you, Paul.


                   That's why he betrayed Dominic and
                   me to our enemies and sent his own
                   man to kill me in Miami.

      Mangano is stunned.


                   But I leave it to my people to
                   deal with that and choose their
                   own boss. And even though it's my
                   right, I won't take revenge,
                   mostly because I'm in a good place
                   mentally and feeling good about me.








                          
                   I don't know, Paul. I can see
                   where some people might have a
                   problem with this.


                   I realize that, so as an extra
                   token of good faith between us,
                   I've taken the liberty of writing
                   down everything I know and putting
                   it in a safe deposit box in case
                   anything happens to me or my
                   family.

      There's a long tense silence while the other bosses
      consider all this. Then, finally --


                   I don't know what anybody else
                   thinks, but I say good luck and
                   God bless, Paul.


                   Good luck, Paul. Salut.

      They all raise their glasses and toast Vitti.     Ben raises
      his glass to Vitti and drinks.


                          
                   Well done.

      Vitti smiles at him and drinks.






      Ben and Vitti come out of the building and cross to the
      car. Jelly is waiting, Iron Mike has the MOTOR RUNNING,
      and Jimmy is in the front seat with him.


                   Let's move.

      Sindone and Mangano come out with guns drawn, flanked by
      two wise guys.


                   Vitti!







      Vitti and his crew turn and face Sindone and Mangano
      across the parking lot.


                   I don't want to do this, Primo.


                   You don't want to do this? That's
                   fuckin' rich. What did you think,
                   you could just quit and walk away?
                   You think this is a fuckin' civil
                   service job? What are you, crazy?


                   Not anymore.
                          
                   Hey, Carlo, tell me. You gonna
                   stab me in the back like the piece
                   of shit I always knew you were?

      Mangano stares at him, cold and hard.


                   I'm not gonna stab you in the
                   back, Paul. I want to see your
                   face when I do it.


                   I don't think so.
                          
                   Mo-Mo!

      Mo-Mo stands up from behind a car pointing a shotgun at
      Mangano and Sindone.


                   Bigs!

      Johnny Bigs steps out from behind a shed holding an
      assault rifle.


                   Eddie!

      The back of a van opens to reveal Eddie "Cokes" and Tuna
      manning a military air-cooled machine gun on a tripod.


                   It's over, Primo. Now get the
                   fuck outta here.

      Sindone glares at him, then lowers his gun, turns, and
      starts to walk back into the building joined by Mangano
      and the soldiers.







       Vitti and Ben relax.


                    Good thinking. I was going to
                    bring a machine gun but I don't
                    have one. Of course, we haven't
                    opened the wedding gifts yet.

       Suddenly, Sindone whirls and FIRES at Vitti.

       Ben staggers in front of Vitti and takes the bullet in
       the shoulder.






       The assembled bosses hear the sound of GUNFIRE outside.
       Zello looks at Baldassare.


                    Oh, shit.

       The bosses all jump up and run for the exits.






       As the GUN BATTLE CONTINUES, Sindone jumps into a car and
       tries to escape, but Eddie Cokes RIPS his car with the
       MACHINE GUN, stopping it dead.







       An NYPD armored assault vehicle bursts through the gates.
       Police cruisers and SWAT vans come racing up to the scene,


       Then, from out of the sky, the FBI helicopter descends,
       blaring a warning.


                           
                    Drop your weapons and lie facedown
                    on the ground. I repeat. Drop
                    your weapons and lie facedown on
                    the ground.







      Bosses and fat capos go running through the alleys and
      clambering over fences in their silk suits and expensive
      loafers.




      Agent Ricci, wearing a flak jacket and FBI baseball cap,
      has Sindone down on the ground with his foot on Primo's
      neck and a .45 aimed at his head.


                       
                Don't move! Don't you fucking
                move!


                Hey!   Take a pill, Robocop.

      Vitti is tending to Ben who is on the ground leaning
      against the side of the limo.


                       
                I can't believe it. You took a
                bullet for me. What doctor ever
                did that much for a patient? I'll
                never forget that.


                Paul -- I tripped.


                Yeah. You tripped over your
                unconscious.






      It's a beautiful summer day. Convicts are playing
      basketball and lounging in the yard.






      Ben in a sport coat, and Vitti, in prison whites, are
      sitting around in a circle with several other convicts.
      DONNY, a heavyweight con with a shaved head and numerous
      tattoos is talking.








                   I don't think my mother really
                   listens when I talk. She never
                   listened.


                   And how does that make you feel?


                   It makes me feel angry.


                   I'll bet you feel hurt, too, don't
                   you?


                          
                   Yes, I do.


                   Paul, what would you say about
                   what Donny's feeling?


                   Donny, when you're thirsty, you
                   don't go to the wall -- you go to
                   the well. You know what I'm
                   saying? Your mother may never be
                   able to listen to you, but you
                   have friends here who will.
                   Okay?

      Ben is proud of Vitti's new sensitivity.


                   And be patient, Donny. Most
                   people's problems take months,
                   sometimes years to resolve.


                   I'm doing twenty-five to life.


                   That should be plenty of time.






      Ben and Vitti have just left the therapy group.








                   You know they found Primo Sindone
                   dead in a field near LaGuardia.


                   I heard.
                          
                   I had nothing to do with it.
                   There were guys lined up from
                   Canarsie to Atlantic City who
                   wanted to whack that bastard.


                   Okay, just checking.


                   You know, Doc, I don't think I
                   ever thanked you properly for
                   curing me.


                   We don't say 'cured.' We say you
                   had a 'corrective emotional
                   experience.'


                   You, you, you're very good.


                           
                   No.   You. You.









      Ben and Laura are dancing in the yard. Paper lanterns are
      hung here and there. A bottle of champagne sits open on
      the table. A great TONY BENNETT SONG can be heard playing.


                   Happy?


                   I just can't get used to it.


                   What?








                   It's been three weeks since the
                   last time you were kidnapped. I
                   don't know if I can adjust.

      They kiss as the SONG ENDS.    Ben turns and speaks to
      someone O.S.


                   What do you say, Tony?   One more?

      TONY BENNETT and his trio are set up on the back porch.


                   Whatever you want, Dr. Sobol. My
                   friend told me to stay as long as
                   you wanted me. What do you want
                   to hear, Mrs. Sobol?


                   Your choice, Tony.


                   I was hoping you'd say that.
                          
                   'World on a String,' fellas.

      Tony sings "I've Got the World on a String" as Ben and
      Laura continue to dance. The CAMERA PANS UP and we see
      Michael smiling and shooting video from his bedroom
      window, then the CAMERA PANS UP TO a starry sky, and we...
