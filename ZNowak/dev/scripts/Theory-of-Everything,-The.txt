          TWO BESPECTACLED EYES. Blinking. Alert. Male. Middle-aged.
          Reflected in his shiny GLASSES - a WOMAN, middle-aged, (JANE
          HAWKING) removing the glasses from his nose.
                         

                         
          The MAN's POV, as -
                         
          - his vision goes from FOCUSED to BLURRY as the GLASSES are
          removed.
                         
          - his BLURRY POV of the WOMAN's hands POLISHING his glasses
          with a cloth.
                         
          - his BLURRY POV then shifts  onto a
          SMALL PERSON in the distance jumping up and down.
                         
          - his BLURRY POV of the GLASSES then being replaced on his
          nose, and -
                         
          - with this, his VISION comes abruptly into FOCUS, and the
          SMALL PERSON is revealed to be -- a BOY  playing
          HOPSCOTCH in the RED-CARPETED CORRIDOR.
                         
          - Beyond the BOY, TWO RED-COATED EQUERRIES begin
           to prepare the HALLWAY for a ceremony. They
          lay out potted-plants and drape velvet ropes. One blows his
          nose.
                         
          TIGHT ON: The eyes behind the glasses watching, his eyes
          finally looking downward...as we hear a metallic CLICKING
          sound - "CLICK, CLICK, CLICK..."

          form out of a streaming alphabet with each 'CLICK'. The man
          is at work, selecting LETTERS, then WHOLE WORDS from a MENU

          STEPHEN HAWKING  and his friend, BRIAN

          STEPHEN HAWKING, his face almost entirely covered with
          spectacles and floppy hair, slight of frame, a velvet jacket
          and velvet bow tie, eccentric-looking. STEPHEN is a fun-
          loving, playful, active, young student.
                         
          BRIAN, STEPHEN's best friend. More interested in life than

          STEPHEN and BRIAN arrive at the party, dismount at speed and,
          running to a walk, crash their BIKES into a HEDGE. BRIAN wins
          the race, raises arms aloft as - they enter the PARTY. We

          They reach the PUNCH-BOWL. BRIAN tastes the PUNCH with his

          JANE, shy, has her hair up in a fashionable bouffant roll.

                    them and do my research at Oxford,

          STEPHEN smiles - then glances at the mirror-backed bar.

          this?
                         
          TIGHT ON: STEPHEN's face: we see JANE's reflection appear and
          disappear in the glass of his glasses as she crosses the
          room.

          JANE and DIANA and two other FRIENDS sit with TWO OTHER YOUNG
          MEN at a table. She looks reluctant and unhappy to be with
          them. As one YOUNG MAN pours them beers she hands her beer to

          STEPHEN is not afraid to stand in front of this crowd of
          Girls and Jocks and stare straight at JANE. The others fall
          silent and stare at STEPHEN, but JANE's eyes light up.

                    Stephen, come in. Sit down. Now--
                    we're all rather concerned--about
                    your choice of subject. What it's

          One of SCIAMA's PENS sits precariously on the edge of the
          desk, and in shuffling papers, knocks it off.

          The PEN rolls off the DESK and falls on the FLOOR in front of
          STEPHEN. STEPHEN stares at the PEN as it comes to a STOP.

          SCIAMA shows STEPHEN the famous lab.
                         

                       This lab is where JJ Thomson
                       discovered the electron, where
                       Rutherford split the atom. One of
                       the great rewards of this job is
                       that you never know from where the
                       next great leap forward is going to
                       come, or from whom.
                         
          SCIAMA takes out a pen and writes on a pad, tears it off and
          gives it to STEPHEN.
                         

                       Next Friday. I'm taking a few

          SCIAMA exits. STEPHEN looks around at the empty LAB. He goes
          to the BLACKBOARD, picks up a piece of CHALK, looks at the
          BLANK BOARD, but then puts the CHALK back down and then
          begins to study, with RAPT AWE, the ancient LABORATORY

          PHILIPPA snorts back laughter, whilst the other HAWKINGS

                       support machine. I am not certain
                       how long he will live.

                       I need to know whether my staff
                       should disconnect the ventilator?
                         
          JANE switches to ENGLISH -
                         


                       What are you talking about?
                         


                       If we try to bring him round from
                       the anaesthetic it is not sure he
                       will survive resuscitation.
                         

                       Stephen must live! You have to
                       bring him round from the
                       anaesthetic!
                         

                       Are you sure this is what you
                       want? The only way of weaning him
                       off the ventilator would be to
                       give him a tracheotomy, a hole in
                       the neck, by-passing the throat.
                       He will never speak again.
                         
          JANE stares at him - deeply upset but finally manages to

                         

                       There's no question. Stephen must
                       live. I will see he gets everything
                       he needs. I will have him
                       transferred back to Cambridge.

          Meanwhile, A small AIR-RESCUE PLANE nearby awaits JANE and

          JANE turns and faces JONATHAN. A private moment. Her LOOK

          She NODS, SADLY. Her eyes start to well up. His too. It's a
          break-up. Turning to look back to the plane...

          She KISSES   him on the cheek and he presses his cheek against
          hers. They   both hold onto each other for a moment, knowing
          it's their   final embrace, and then she hurries, tearfully,
          toward the   WAITING PLANE, leaving him standing there.

          STEPHEN opens his eyes, looks around him. He is alone. He
          opens his mouth to speak. We hear only a slow exhale of
          air, through the off-screen tracheotomy hole. He PANICS,
          and has to be soothed by a NURSE.

          Recuperating in his chair in the sun, staring out of the

          STEPHEN has never looked more depressed. Or alone. There is a
          plastic FLANGE over the TRACHEOTOMY HOLE.
                         
          ANGLE ON the FINGERS of his right hand, resting on the arm
          of the wheelchair. These, at least, can still move.
                         

                       Stephen?
                         
          JANE moves into STEPHEN's limited POV - holding a CLEAR
          PLASTIC SCREEN - an E-TRAN "SPELLING" BOARD, on which 6
          groups of characters are arranged.
                         

                       This is a Spelling Board. First,
                       you tell me what letter you want by
                       blinking when I say the colour of
                       the group that contains that
                       letter. Once I know the group, you
                       can choose the character inside
                       that group by blinking again when I
                       go through the colours of each
                       letter in that group. Apparently.
                       Okay? Let's just try.
                         
          STEPHEN says nothing.
                         

                       So...Green, Yellow, Blue, White,
                       Black, Red.

                       Blink to choose the group that
                       contains the letter you want?
                       Green? Yellow? Blue? White? Black?
                       Red?
                         
          As JANE's eyes fill with TEARS...STEPHEN just keeps looking
          at her...then TRIES TO SPEAK. His mouth moves...but nothing -
          nothing ever again! - will ever come out!
                         
          It's a heart-breaking moment-- for both of them--and when
          TEARS appear in his eyes, she can't stop her own TEARS from
          falling.

          STEPHEN gloomily reads a newspaper with the help of a READING
          FRAME, when -
                         
          JANE enters.
                         

                    She's here. Okay. Promise not to
                    eat her alive...
                         
          Enter: ELAINE MASON. She is attractive.
                         
          Exit: JANE, touching ELAINE supportively on the shoulder.
                         

                    So then - Professor. How are you?
                    My name is Elaine. I'm going to be
                    your nurse, would you like that?
                    No? Well- we'll work it out.
                         
          He stares at her, as -
                         
          - ELAINE goes and gets a CHAIR, taking an interest in her,

                         
          - ELAINE turns and catches him look at her.
                         
          Swiftly, STEPHEN turns his eyes back to the NEWSPAPER. ELAINE
          looks at him a moment longer, surprises to see that STEPHEN
          is not unlike any other man in this regard. A faint smile
          appears. She sits in front of him.
                         

                    So then...
                         
                         

                         
          ELAINE holds the E-TRAN BOARD and writes down a letter, then
          looks up at STEPHEN - sees through the clear perspex
          immediately what group he is looking at. She doesn't have to
          call out the colours - knows them. (See her POV of him
          through the board so we establish the eye-line principle.)
          She is BRILLIANT at this.
                         
          STEPHEN's eyes FLICK from GROUP to GROUP, no BLINKING going
          on.
                         


                    Red group--Yellow letter. T. Green

                    Green. A....T.E.A. Tea.

          DOWN THE BOARD. They look at each other...
                         

                       You've memorised the board. Of

                       interface that scans through the
                       alphabet and allows each letter to
                       be selected one by one. Using this

          STEPHEN watches her, as aware of the enormous significance of
          this moment as she - then slowly - slowly - motors toward
          her. He stops just behind her, then nudges her leg, ever so
          gently, with his own lifeless foot, the way a pony will nudge

          GUEST 1, stands and reads her question from a SLIP OF PAPER.
          
                         

                       How have you been able to deal
                       with all the physical challenges
                       you face?
                         
          STEPHEN stares at the AUDIENCE, who wait awkwardly for a
          reply. It's as if STEPHEN wishes to speak with his own
          voice, and is struggling to do so. In failure his eyes turn
          sadly to his screen, and then clicks the pad in his hand.

                         

                       Can you hear me?

                       There are some things I cannot
                       do. But. They are mostly the
                       things I don't particularly want
                       to do anyway.
                         

                       Now you are recognized
                       everywhere, how do you deal with

                       I was stopped recently by a
                       tourist in Cambridge who asked if
                       I was 'the real Stephen Hawking.'
                       I replied that I was not, and
                       said the real one was--much

                      In 1979 you talked about the
                      possibility of a theory of
                      everything being discovered
                      before the end of the century.
                         

                      I now predict -- that I was

                      I have experimental evidence that
                      Time Travel is not possible. I gave
                      a party for Time-Travellers but no-

          LAUGHTER. As GUEST 5 rises and starts to speak, the volume
          goes down on this question...

          CLOSE ON STEPHEN, slipping into a reverie as - he notices
          the CAP of a YOUNG LADY's PEN falls off the front lecture
          bench and drops to the floor.... STEPHEN stares
          at the fallen CAP.

          ANGLE ON STEPHEN gets an idea. He wants to go and pick up
          that fallen CAP...Miraculously, the muscles in his
          slackened face start to stir...slowly his distorted
          expression straightens...his slumped head stirs and
          moves...his fingers stir...his feet ...his legs...he
          slowly, slowly straightens in his wheelchair, and not only
          this...he even begins to rise painfully out of it, at last
          standing on his own... Standing, he crosses the floor,
          picks up the fallen CAP, and holds it out the pretty YOUNG
          LADY. She smiles at him, not at all astonished!

                    ...but--ever since the dawn of
                    civilisation, people have craved
                    for an understanding of the
                    underlying order of the world.
                    There ought to be something very
                    special about the boundary
                    conditions of the universe - and
                    what can be more special than that
                    there is no boundary? And there
                    should be no boundary to 
                    human endeavour. We are all
                    different. There is no such thing
                    as a standard or run of the mill
                    human being--but we share the same
                    human spirit. However bad life may
                    seem, there is always something you
                    can do, and succeed at. While
                    there's life, there is hope.

          Left unattended, he motors forward a short distance and stops
          to watch his children. Fulfillment floods into his
          expression. A moment of deep satisfaction. He then looks
          around for JANE, finally making his CHAIR turn around.
