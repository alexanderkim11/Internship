    WE MEET: MUMBLES. They are
    listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS.

    We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a
    changing city, LONDON.


              Two years ago this property cost one
              million pounds.
                  
              Today, it costs five million.

    The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to
    see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera
    will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene.

              How did this happen?
                  (CUT TO relevant
                   pictures as he speaks)
              Attractive tax opportunities for
              foreign investment, restrictive
              building consent and massive hedge
              fund bonuses,...
                  
              London, my good man, is fast becoming
              the financial and cultural capital
              of the world.


              And of course the Russians have come
              to town.


              Makes it hard to compete with an ex-
              Soviet oligarch that has six billion
              dollars in his back pocket. They
              don't haggle the price, they double
              the price.


              Russians come, prices rise, and it
              doesn't stop. It only goes one way.


              Up.


              I can't teach you how to skin a cat,
              but I can tell you a lot about the
              money in bricks and mortar.

                 Like he said, it's going one way.
                 You need to see a lawyer.








    PINK Revision    -   6-19-07                                2.



    One Two and Mumbles look at one another.


              We need to see a Lawyer.



    CUT TO a modern looking LAWYER'S office.   We SEE the LAWYER
    advising MUMBLES AND ONE TWO.


              They say it's only going one way.



    ONE TWO and the LAWYER are here looking at the building, it
    is a bit dilapidated and bleak.


              It looks like a great deal.



    We cut back into the office where the LAWYER lays out the
    building plans.


              These are the plans,...it costs ten
              and it'll be worth twenty with
              planning. But first you gotta give
              the councilor a drink.



    CUT TO the desk of a COUNCILOR (mid thirties middle
    management)who is receiving a brown envelope from the LAWYER.


                  
              Tell them they'll get the planning,...



    We CUT BACK to our LAWYER now smug.    One Two and Mumbles are
    standing in front of him.


              You'll get the planning. Take care
              of the councilor and it will move
              like shit through a goose.

               We need help.


               Lenny Cole?


               Dog number one,...


               But he moves fast and he loves bricks
               and mortar.



     MEET LENNY COLE, Mumbles and One
     Two are here. Lenny's office is kitsch, he fancies himself
     as a man of class.


               I do move fast and I love bricks and
               mortar, properties are always the
               safe bet, but you better know what
               you're doing 'cos this ain't soft
               money. You trip up,...
                   
               And it's not me that's gonna get
               hurt. You got security?


               We got property.


               Don't let me down boys.
                   
               Come on then, give us your hand.
     They shake hands and sign the papers.

     The Councilor is the phone to the Lawyer.      He speaks in hushed
     tones clandestine like.


                   
               Can't talk now, but there has been a
               problem. I can't get you the
               planning.



     The Lawyer is on the phone with Mumbles and One Two.


                   
               I'm sorry boys, can't get the
               planning.



     One two is on the phone.      He looks over to Mumbles.


               He can't get the planing.


               He can't get the planing?



     Lenny is looking out to One Two and Mumbles who are standing
     outside his car looking very white. Lenny screams from the
     back seat.


               What do you mean you can't get the
               fuckin planning?
                   
               There is seven million of my cash in
               there, without planning it's worth
               five,...you owe me. I take the
               building, you lose your share, but I
               am still outta pocket two large ones.
               Find it.

     The window goes up and the car pulls off.      Lenny picks up
     his phone, he dials huffing and puffing.

                 Is that you Councilor?
                      
                 I hear you got that car you was
                 after,....now, sort the planning
                 out.


                 Sorted Lenny.

     He puts the phone down and looks over smiling.     MEET ARCHY
     .


                 What's wrong with you Arch?

                 That's a bit strong isn't it Len?
                 They come from the same place as
                 you, you'll clean 'em out.


                 Same place as me? Do I look like an
                 immigrant Archy?
                     
                 No one gave me a leg up, did they?
                 They need a bit of fear, 'cos
                 otherwise they're gonna come up
                 against me,...need a little lesson
                 don't they?



     One Two and Mumbles are here, it's quiet until,..


                 We gotta sell.


                 And be left with what?


                 Just gotta start again,....





     Start CREDITS over sports arena entrance.

     Lenny is being walked down a corridor, the      walls are lined
     with photographs of old soccer stars.





     PINK Revision   -   6-20-07                             4A.



     On each side of him are two ESCORTS(ex-military types, heavy
     looking). As they pass each door, we realize where ever he
     is going, it has to be important. The ESCORTS talk in to
     their microphones and to the different GUARDS on each door
     way.








     WHITE Revision   -   6-6-07                                5.



     Every now and then we see the SPORTS ARENA in the back ground.
     At last we reach the main door to the head office.



     As the door is opened we see a small crowd of MEN in suits
     gathered around a kind-looking MAN with bright blue eyes.
     He nods a couple of times.

     We CUT TO the front of Lenny who is clearly impressed, Mr.
     Blue eyes pays him no attention. The small crowd of business
     MEN shake hands and head to the door at which Lenny is waiting
     patiently.



     CLOSE UP on the back of URI (Russian Jew, 40s, slick, and
     well groomed, he is our Mr. Blue Eyes) overlooking his sports
     arena. We stay on the back of Uri's head while he is talking
     to Lenny.


               Glad you could join us here Lenny.


               It's nice to see you Uri.


               Good.
                   
               I can see we are very much alike you
               and I Lenny. We like to get things
               done.
                   
               What's it going to cost me?


               First, let me make clear how much we
               can help you benefit from this deal.
               With out me, it will take you five
               to ten years to get the permission
               to erect your arena.
                   
               Second, with Government policy as it
               so stands we both know it's unlikely
               that you'd ever get that consent.
                   
               Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions
               and building consent, you'd be paying
               6 to 12 million without any real
               guarantee of that result.

     We CUT TO Uri unfazed, he just wants the figure.





     PINK Revision    -   6-20-07                           5A.




                  So Lenny,..... how much?








     PINK Revision    -   6-19-07                               6.




               Seven million Euros.

     Still unfazed.


               I expect a guarantee that I have
               consent within six months and no red
               tape.


               That's right Uri, you can consider
               that done.

     Pause while tension stews, then,...


               Drink!     Follow me.


     Uri walks to the bar. Lenny follows trying to contain his
     excitement, he's out of his league, a "welcome to the
     billionaires club" look has struck him pink. Lenny passes a
     PICTURE that's sat on an EASEL.


               Oh, that's a nice picture Uri, hasn't
               it got, errrh depth?

     Uri is at the bar now. He has placed one large tumbler down
     and is pouring a very very large measure out.


               That picture has brought me nothing
               but luck Lenny,..it's my lucky
               picture.
                   
               You like? Take it for a while, maybe
               it will give you luck.


               Oh I couldn't Uri,...

     Still absorbed with the painting.


               Now we're partners, I insist. I
               will get it sent around to your house
               and you can give it back to me when
               our deal is finalized.

     Lenny looks at the bar. Uri motions, there is a SMALL KEG
     of WHISKEY on the bar and only one large glass.





     PINK Revision    -   6-20-07                                 6A.




                  I thought you lot drunk Vodka.


                  Whiskey is the new Vodka.


                  You not joining me Uri?

               I don't drink.


               Oh,...cheers then,...


               To success.

     Lenny awkwardly starts to glug as Uri looks on.



     Lenny enters the back seat of his car, Archy is waiting for
     him in the back.


               You all right there Len?      You look a
               little pink.


                   
               Turbo, get us a perrier and a wet
               wipe live-o.

     Lenny's panting.


               Tried to poison me the dirty
               Cossack...

     TURBO  is fumbling around in the front seat
     trying to get ice into a glass from the cooler that sits
     beside him.


               Stop messing about and give us the
               bottle Turbo.

               So, how's the billionaires club?

     Lenny grabs the drink, desperately takes a big glug of water
     and wipes his face.


               That Communism didn't seem to slow
               'em down did it? We've hit the big
               time here Archy boy!
                   
               What's wrong? Where's the old Archy
               smile?

                  You wanna watch out there. Times
                  are changing, they don't have too
                  much respect for the old school.

               Shut up Archy,...
                   
               No school like the old school,...I
               still run this town see? That's why
               he came to me right? Got that?


               Yeah, got that.



     Uri looks at VICTOR .   They're looking
     down at Lenny's disappearing car.


               You think you should have leant him
               your lucky picture?

               It makes the peasant feel royal,...
               don't spoil it, we need him at the
               moment. I want that consent.
                   
               Call the accountant and get her to
               clear the money.



     A man and woman sit on one side of a desk, MEET STELLA AND
     BERTIE. Bertie is 45 and handsome in a dark posh sort of
     way. Stella is 32, film star. Sitting opposite them are
     two TAX MEN(civil servant types, grey, middle aged, a little
     tubby and bald). There's a stand off.


               Look, can we shut the door?

     There's a pause while the TAX MAN looks at his colleague.


               Shut the door.

     His colleague gets up and shuts the door.


               Let's put our cards on the table.
               We both know you aren't going to get
               the full forty out of my clients.


               This is the tax office and in the
               end we get what we want.






     PINK Revision    -   6-19-07                                  9.




                  Save that speech for the tourists
                  Charlie and let's strike a deal -
                  take the twenty now and let it go.
                  Otherwise, they'll move the company
                  off shore tomorrow and you'll spend
                  the next twenty years chasing an
                  imaginary forty million around every
                  republic that grows bananas.

     Bertie lifts out papers from his brief case.


                  I see why you married her now Bertie.

     The two TAX MEN look at each other, they're thinking the
     same thought.




                  I told you we'd make a great team,..
                  You know why you get those deals?

     She looks relatively bored.


                  Because those fat, sad, old men like
                  it when you swear at them. They

                  that can be quite inconvenient at
                  times.

     The phone rings, Bertie picks it up and answers.

               seven million Euros from a bank I

               Yes,..I don't want this coming back
               to me so, if you could give them a
               black eye,..that might help.
     She see's a slight pause and look of concern from One Two.


               A black eye, nothing more.

     She passes him an envelope.


               Ok, very good Mrs. Dexter, a black
               eye it is then.

     Two guys are here counting money. MEET ROMAN and MICKEY,
     two black Americans. (Mid 30s dressed very classy, with a
     bit of an urban twist) They are in the managing game,
     exploiting the talents of the English.

     The sound of distant bass thudding through the walls can be
     heard while Mickey is on the phone trying to do some kind of
     business. A real ROCKER with long hair and good looks comes
     walking in distressed.

                  I need the dry ice Mickey, I need
                  the dry ice. My show just doesn't
                  work without it.


                      
                  If you told me yesterday you needed
                  dry ice, I would have gotten you the
                  driest ice the world could offer,
                  but you didn't ask for no dry ice.
                  You asked for two cases of Johnny
                  Walker black label and four ladies
                  of the pole and I got them for you
                  didn't I?

     There's a pause from the Rocker.


                  Didn't I?


                  Yes you did I do confess, but Mickey,
                  you're the manager and I am the
                  rocker. You've got on the managers
                  hat, now pluck something out of it.


                  My hat is deep and full of magic. I
                  got rabbits, handkerchiefs, and ladies
                  of the pole drinking Black Label. I
                  got smoke machines, bubble machines,
                  I even got love marines and still
                  the hat goes deeper, but....there
                  ain't no mother fuckin dry ice.


                  Ok, ok, come home, you've made your

     ROMAN looks up from his paper, having not got involved in
     the slightest. Roman taps the paper he has been reading.

               How many rock stars by the name of
               Johnny Story do you think there are
               in this universe Mickey?


               The only thing he's fallen off is
               his junkies spoon, he's no deader
               than the suit you're wearing now.
               He'll be gearing himself up somewhere
               happy as clam in a fisherman's net.

     On the tennis court we see the COUNCILOR(our man from the
     beginning), who is playing tennis with TERRY THE INSTRUCTOR.
     The Councilor is taking it seriously apart from the
     distraction of JACKIE on the next door court. ARCHY is here
     watching over the game and reading the paper, we see him
     read an article and look a little moved. Lenny comes up
     behind him and starts to read over his shoulder.

               We will never mention this again,
               all right Arch?

     Archy looks a little shocked.     Lenny carries on like nothing
     has happened.


               Now, tell the Councilor to stop fuckin
               about with sticks and balls and send
               him inside.

                Fancy a cool down and a chat with
                Lenny?

     The Councilor slyly looks over to Jackie, she looks back.
     The Councilor is thinking explicit thoughts.


                Do you know Jackie?

     Nervous, the Councilor knows these thugs aren't shy.


                No, no, no, Archy, don't say anything.

                Don't worry, she's a friend,..and a
                member.
                    
                Jackie,..fancy a run'a'round with
                the Councilor?

     Pause.   She looks sullen, stroppy and rude all at the same
     time.


                Only if he's wicked.

     She turns away to hit a ball, the Councilor's heart skips a
     beat.


                    
                What does she mean by that?


                I think she likes you boy-o.



     Lenny is at the bar on his own looking at the papers and
     picking at the nuts. In walks the Councilor with Archy, the
     Councilor sits next to Lenny at the bar.


                They say that times are changing
                Councilor, that this country isn't
                what it used to be, it's the new New
                York, they say. You being a political
                man must know all about that.

               times have changed, but that shouldn't
               affect you Lenny.


               They say it's all gone "international"
               now, out with the old guard in with
               the new, but I think they're wrong.
                   
               Anyway, where are my manners? Look
               at you sweaty as a native and pink
               as a pelican,...and I haven't even
               offered you a wet one.

               Oh that's nice,..refreshing, that'll
               put you back on top boy.

     Lenny pulls out the plans and a leather pack of cigars.


               Here you go, plans and papers.
                   
               Would you like a cigar?


               I don't mind if I do,...that's a
               nice lighter.


               Eight grand they wanted for it cheeky
               toads and I paid, you know why?


               Tell me Lenny.


               'Cos it's all about the details.

     Looking at the plans.


                   
               Is our little deal in there too Lenny?

     Lenny milks the silence while he lights his cigar, the
     Councilor feels like a prick waiting, it goes on and on.

               I gotta run, can't stay here chewing
               the fat all day, a mans got to make
               a living. Call me in the 'morrow.

     He walks toward the door as Jackie is walking in, Lenny looks
     slyly at her as they pass.


               Look after him Jackie.

     In the distance.


               Oh Lenny, you forgot your lighter.

     Lenny looks back to the Councilor.


               Can't be mine, it's got your name on
               it.

     CUT TO the bottom of the lighter, "THE COUNCILOR." Lenny
     carries on walking and smiling.



     It's the next morning, we SEE One Two running. Mumbles and

               Yeah, it looks like a heap of shit,
               but it can't half go.
                   
               A bit like you One Two.

     Mumbles turns to Handsome Bob


               I reckon he's trying to get fit for
               the lady. Nothing gets under his
               skin like a lady he can't have, does
               it?
                   
               A straight going, cocky, educated,
               arrogant posh bird trips him right
               up. I reckon we should set Handsome
               Bob on her. That'll liven you up
               One Two.


               Bob wouldn't know where to begin.


               I'm good with the posh ones, don't
               you worry about that.


               I've had enough of this, can you two
               piss off cos I am trying to find my
               "zone"

     One Two sprints off leaving them behind.


               He can't half run for a white fella.



     Lenny is pacing in a ladies dressing gown with long silk
     socks. He can't sleep, he pours a large one, lights a cigar,
     picks up the phone and dials.


               Archy? You awake?
                   
               Never mind, you are now. I had a
               horrible dream that the Councilor
               didn't come through, I don't want
               anything going wrong on this one,
               that Russian's the key to the big
               time.
                   
               You think he's all right?

                  What did Jackie say?

     His feet go back up on the desk with confidence.


                  She did? I knew he'd like the
                  lighter, nice touch eh? She's a
                  good girl that Jackie.
                      
                  Give her another drink.
                      
                  You're right, he wouldn't have leant
                  me his lucky painting if he didn't
                  mean business. Yeah, I had it taken
                  off it's easel and stuck it above my
                  desk, it's looks magnifi....

     He suddenly stops. His eyes have spotted something scary,
     the office chair disappears from under him, he takes the
     phone, the lamp, and the ash tray with him to the floor.


                      
                  Arch! Arch! I have been robbed.

     He turns the receiver the right way round.


                  I said I have been robbed.
                      
                  I don't know when. The painting,..
                  it's gone.

     He stands fumbling and screaming, his scotch all over him.


                  The one Uri gave me!
                      
                  All right LOANED for fucks sake!

     Beat while panic sets in and Archy is saying something on
     the other end.


                  This isn't good Arch, it's his
                  favorite painting, his lucky painting!
                  Get round here and bring the troops.

     Lenny's still pacing, a small gathering of tired looking
     HOOLIGANS are lined up in Lenny's office.


               Where was it Len?

     Lenny is standing in front of the fire place smoking and
     looking very anxious.

     There is a bald spot above his head where a picture once
     stood, a picture light illuminates an clearly empty space.
     He is horrified by the stupidity of the question.


                  Let's take a wild stab in the dark
                  shall we Bandy? Archy slap him and
                  then send him to school 'cos I can't
                  take any more of this. You sort it
                  out, get that picture back and bring
                  me a body, I am going to back to
                  bed.

     He stomps off to bed.


                  Bandy if you ever ask a stupid
                  question like that again, you see
                  Danny there? He's gonna slap you.


                  Sorry Arch, it's just,...I was trying
                  to use initiative.


                  Danny slap him.

     DANNY slaps him with the back of his left hand.       Archy's not
     happy - it was the wrong hand.


                  With the right Danny,..properly.

     DANNY slaps him again, it's weak.


                  I said properly, with the back of
                  your right hand Danny.


                  What is this a tennis match Arch?


                  Slap him!

     DANNY slaps him again, BANDY takes it good. Archy huffs and
     goes over to slap him proper, SLAP! Bandy's disappeared
     into another dimension.


                  Like that!

               like that, there's no need for your
               clients to hold back. They'll open
               up like a fountain full of words
               after one of those.

               Look, thinks he's back at school.


               But he never went to school.


               Daniel, do you want a slap as well?
               Now, if the slap doesn't work,..Cut
               'em...or pay 'em, but keep the
               receipts 'cos this ain't the Mafia.
                   
               Now, get to work and find that

     Mumbles, Handsome Bob, and One Two are standing here dressed
     as security guards. Handsome Bob is watching over the car
     that is waiting for the TWO ACCOUNTANTS to come out of the
     back door of the warehouse. One Two and Mumbles are to the
     side.


               You ready?


               Yup, load up boys and pay attention.

     One Two see's the door open and makes a move. Two ACCOUNTANTS
     come out of the back door, while in route they click their
     central locking open on the car waiting. One Two is already
     on them as the ACCOUNTANTS go to open their car door.


               Hello lads.

     He flashes the gun in his belt. The ACCOUNTANTS are too
     shocked to even know what is going on.


               Put the bags in the car and walk
               away.

     The ACCOUNTANTS see the gun, but still look for a way out.
     Mumbles meets them with another gun.

                  Don't be silly boys, do as you are

                  him the keys and walk away smiling.

     The ACCOUNTANTS do as they are told. One Two and Mumbles
     get into the car, calm as you like. One Two, starts the
     engine, but he can't find reverse. There is a crunching
     sound from the car, the accountants stop and look round.
     One Two puts down the window.


                   
               Oi, come back here.

     The ACCOUNTANTS come back.


               Where's reverse?


               You have to lift up the nob under
               the gear stick.
     One Two struggles, then finds the gear.


               Right, now fuck off.


                   
               Slowly and keep smiling.


               Shit,...


               What?


               I have got to hurt him.
                   
               Oi come back here.

               Why? What did he ever do to you?
               Come on we've got the money now let's
               piss off!

     The Accountant has made his away back to the car.


               Yes?

     One Two goes through the motions getting ready to hit the
     accountant without actually being able to do it.


               Shit, I can't do it.

     Mumbles and One Two take off driving.


                    
               You're an embarrassment to crime you
               are.


               She asked me to give him a black
               eye.


               She's sick that bird of yours, sick.
     Quickly changing the subject.


               Is Handsome Bob behind?


               He's there.



     Uri is walking around looking over one his sites, he's
     entertaining a corporate gathering of MEN all in suits and
     hard hats.


               The developement has been underway
               for four years and will be completed
               within another two. The area covers
               twelve acres and it will become one
               of Londons premiere residences.

     We can SEE VICTOR  in the background
     looking anxious.


               Thirty two floors and six
               acres,....excuse me gentlemen,..

     Victor leans in and whispers to Uri.    After 15 seconds Uri
     leans back.


                      
                  Do they know who we are?


                      
                  It's not like the old country, it's
                  cowboys and Indians out here.


                      
                  We don't have time to play
                  games,..people and business are
                  waiting. Speak to the accountant
                  and get some more money.
                      
                  And Victor, this time no problems.



     Stella is here again looking at the abstract pictures on the
     wall. One Two joins her, he's got a largish Louis Vuitton
     with the money and her twenty percent in it.

                  you didn't think much of the black
                  eye though.

                  I want the Tank.


                  You won't see him on the cobbles at
                  this time of night, you know how
                  much he likes the cold. He's at the
                  end of the street tucked up watching
                  a Zulu movie.



     Archy knocks on window of massive American 4x4. The window
     comes down, savage noises emanate from the interior, a massive
     black bald head turns, MEET TANK very street, very soft spoken
     and very articulate. He's sitting next to a SHAVAWN a street
     girl.


                  Hello Arch, what you doing here?


                  I need a word.


                  Well don't stand out there on the
                  cobbles it's freezing, step into my
                  world.
                      
                  Shavawn get us a couple of vanilla
                  chai lattes, there's a good girl.

     She disappears.




                  Great movie this Arch. They've had
                  it digitally re-mastered, glorious
                  picture and the sounds exquisite.

     He presses the remote, the sound goes up so all we can hear
     is the sound of spears on shields.

                  Oh I like this bit, thousands and
                  thousands of 'em, but them red coats
                  just don't move. That's courage
                  that is Arch.
                      
                  They did have guns mind.

     The sound of screaming and death is penetrating.


                  Turn it down a tad, I need to have a
                  word.

     Tank flicks the pause button.


                  Where are my manners? Sorry Arch,
                  what do you want, tickets? I got
                  just the show for you, a Chinese
                  orphan with a learning disability
                  that don't stop singing and dancing
                  all the way through the first half.
                  Then, up pops a Geisha girl and it
                  all goes magical in the second; the
                  wife will love it and you can't get
                  tickets for love nor,...


                  I don't want tickets, I need you to
                  find me a painting, a classic, been
                  nicked outta of Lenny's house. And
                  since you got more feet on the street
                  than coppers on the beat,...
                      (starting to make his
                       way out)
                  I'd like you to assist. I'll leave
                  you a little livener. There's a

                  wagging.


     All the boys are sitting around playing cards. The buzzer
     goes, buzzzzzzzzzzz, Fred answers the intercom.

     He presses the button and walks back to the group.


               How's your Mum taking it Handsome?

               Sorry Bob, I didn't mean to offend.

     In the background we see the door open and in comes two
     thieving SCOTSMEN, they are selling fur coats.


               Who wants another cuppa?


                   
               Thank you.


               Glass of milk for me, my love.

     Our thieves move over to the table. MEET our cocky Scotsmen
     MALCOLM and his partner in crime PAUL. Malcolm drops his
     bags and starts to get busy. He's got a strong Scottish
     accent that has been influenced by last nights crack for
     dinner and two large whisky's for breakfast.


               Good afternoon gentlemen.

     He coughs nervously as the boys look on dead pan.    He sees
     Dolly.

               Excuse me my love, any chance of a
               wee dram of water to oil the larynx?


               Get on with it.


                   
               Ok gentlemen here we go. First, my
               colleague Paul will be modeling the
               grey wolf.

     We see Paul who's obviously completely geared out of his
     nut, he's trying to squeeze in to the stolen grey wolf fur

     arms, it's not possible to do the buttons up.

               I must apologize for my assistants
               handicaps. He has unusually long
               arms and an alarmingly small neck.
                   (beat, the crowd is
                    unimpressed)
               Now, I do agree it doesn't seem like
               the right time to acquire a coat of
               such thermal efficiency. However, I
               have been informed that we are looking
               at a very white winter. PLUS
               gentlemen and fine lady,..
                   (He winks at Dolly
                    who has got him a
                    very large glass of
                    water)
               Christmas is always round the corner.
     He downs the water without it touching the sides.


               Where did you find these two junkies?


               What is this, a fuckin double act?


               Shut up and tell us the price.


               All in good time gentlemen, all in
               good time.
                   
               Paul, why don't you sit down for a
               while.

     If Paul doesn't sit down, he's gonna fall down. He stumbles
     into the card table on his way to a seat, knocking drinks
     and cards everywhere. Everyone protests.


                   
               Next, we have a very much sought
               after affair seen in very, very glossy
               magazines,..

     He jumps up wearing the most ridiculously oversized fur coat
     and matching hat you have ever seen.


               The famous, but rare black bear from
               the dark mountains of Siberian
               Calcutta.

     He starts to do a slow spin, at which point WE SEE a large
     white stipe running down the furs back.


               Get an eye full of that stripe
               gentlemen.


               Have a look at that, it's a six foot
               skunk.

     Everyone thinks its very fuckin funny.     The laughter is
     interrupted only by the buzzer.

     Buzzzzzzzzzz, Fred goes to answers the buzzer.


               And all of this could be yours for a
               staggeringly low,...

     Cut to Fred at the buzzer.


               All right Arch.

     Back to the table, everyone's ears prick up at the name.
     Malcolm pauses before he panics, he can tell something is
     up.


               Yeah, come on up.

     Everyone starts tucking their money into their pockets.
     Fred makes his way back to the table. He speaks to Malcolm
     and Paul.


               You two out, live-o.
                   
               The back door.

     Malcolm knows this is a sign to go.


               Come on Paul, we'll be going now.

     The two Scotsmen race in their fur coats toward the back
     door. IN WALKS Archy with Danny, the crew continue their
     card game.


               All right Arch?

     Pause while the boys carry on playing cards.


               So where is it then?


               What, can't you smell it?

     One Two slowly kicks it out from under the table. Archy
     leans over to take the bag and One Two sticks a few notes in
     his pocket.


               And buy yourself a new pair of shoes.

     Archy turns and heads out - he's smiling and mutters to
     himself.


               Silly bastards.



     Uri has got some serious stink boat gin palace on the River
     Thames. He's entertaining Stella.

               enjoy a boat, the day you buy it and
               the day you sell it.


               Well, according to my figures that
               sounds about right, but what can you
               do?
                   
               Beauty is a cruel mistress.

               pour you a glass?

                way you...are. Always thinking about
                business, very professional.


                That's what you pay me to be, isn't
                it?

     He nods.


                Tell me about your husband.

     Slightly uncomfortable


                My husband is a lawyer.

                I hear he is very good at what he
                does, maybe we can have some work
                for him.

     Pause, she's dead pan and not giving anything away.


                Tell me, what do you do for fun?

     Pause.


                Have I offended you in some way?


                I don't quite know where this is

                like to keep our relationship
                professional.

     There is a pause while Uri is slightly lost for words. Then
     he slams the table in excitement and looks up at Victor who
     is standing in the distance.


                You see Victor, this is what I am

               money, it does have to be accounted

     Lenny walks into the warehouse where we see TWO SLOANES (posh
     kids, 20s) strapped to a pair of chairs with weights on the
     bottom. There are large leather belts wrapped around them.


               Right, I am going to tell you how
               this works. You're going in the
               drink and I am going to make a cup
               of tea.

     Archy grabs a hook attached to an electric winch and attaches
     it to their leather belts.


               Underneath the floor boards is the
               famous river Thames. I hope for
               your sakes you can hold your breath
               for as long as it takes to boil that
               kettle. After that, I am going to
               ask you a question, one question.
               You are going to give me a name and
               if it's the right name, I send you
               home warm and dry in a fresh set of
               clothes. If it's the wrong name,
               you'll be fed to the cray fish,....see
               ya.

     He presses the green button and a hatch in the floor opens.
     The TWO SLOANES are lowered into the river protesting.



     Handsome Bob's got the long face on.

               What have I got to cheer up about, I

               But that's tomorrow night, tonight
               its take off time, we've prepared a

                  They've got a night off from the
                  Russians and they've all been greased
                  down just for the Bobski! It's going
                  to take you two and a half years
                  just to recover from this little
                  party.

     Handsome Bob isn't impressed.


               That cheered you up then?


                   (still not looking
                    happy)
               It's not that I am ungrateful One
               Two, it's just,....


               It's just what?


               Don't worry,..you wouldn't understand.

     Pause for a concerned thought from One Two.

               I understand anything coming from
               you Bobby boy.


               Would you?


               You're me best mate.

     There is a pause from Handsome Bob.


               I don't want the strippers One
               Two,....
                   
               I want you,....

     Pause. A little look from One Two like "Oh you're taken the
     piss", then a realization that he isn't. The brakes are
     slammed on and the car comes to a screeching halt. One Two
     is out before you know it, screaming through the windshield.




               You dirty bastard! I know all your
               girlfriends all of 'em!

               That you're a homa? You're Handsome
               Bob for Gods sake, Handsome Bob the
               lady killer! That is you Bob, do
               you hear me? God, I have had showers
               with you, you've seen my cock!


               I only told you cos I'm going away,
               but I should have kept my mouth shut.


               Fuckin right you should have kept
               your mouth shut, should have drowned
               the cat instead of letting it out
               the bag.

     Bob's now inconsolable sitting in the car.       One Two feels
     bad,...he catches himself.



     One Two is back in the car, he's trying to calm Handsome.


               All right Bob, I am sorry.        I went
               over the top, it was just a       surprise
               that's all.

     The TWO SLOANES have been brought back up and are covered in
     shit and cray fish, they are half drowned.

               Hose 'em down Danny. Get those cray
               fish off 'em. Now, who has that

               One name.

     Archy rips the tape off their mouths at the same time.


               Johnny, Johnny Story. You know the
               singer in that group Story Time.

     This means something to Lenny.

                  That didn't work did it? How can a

                  He's not dead, I know he's not dead
                  because he just tried to sell us
                  that picture and changed his mind at
                  the last minute. He's got like an
                  obsession with it.

     Lenny's face contorts with anger.


                  Put 'em back Arch, before I shoot
                  'em.

     The TWO SLOANES scream in horror.

                  Jesus! I know him, I know who he
                  is,...we went to school with him.

     The tape is put back over their mouths.      They're struggling
     to get free.


                  Len, could I have a word?    Private,..
                  it's worth it.



     Archy looks at Lenny, there is a PAUSE for a while.         They
     both feel uncomfortable.


                  Your boy's not dead, is he?


                      
                  Don't you dare call him my boy.


                  Sorry, I mean your boy, the Ex's
                  boy,...your step son. He had a set
                  of keys to the house didn't he?

     Lenny's red as a beetroot.

     WE CUT BACK TO TEN YEARS AGO. Cut to a shot of a 12 year
     old BOY with a cut under his eye singing "Bank Robber" by
     The Clash in to the mirror. He's wearing just his boxer
     shorts and enjoying himself, he's gonna be a rock star.
     From behind WE SEE his bedroom door open, but the music is
     to loud for the boy to have heard the entrance. We SEE Lenny,
     ten years younger entering, we can tell via the body language
     that he is irritated. He pauses then walks up suddenly
     slapping the boy very hard across the side of the face.
     It's enough to knock him out, the boy goes down - shot like
     a bullet out of a barrel. The red hand then slaps the stereo
     off.


               Listen to me boy, listen. I never
               did like you and neither did your
               real father. You're a reject, a
               wrong-un, a fuckin fairy in the mirror
               that I inherited from your mother,
               but she ain't with us no more, so
               now it's just you and me. In one
               week you go back to school, the best
               fuckin school in the country I might
               add, then you'll be gone for another
               term.
                   
               In the mean time, show me some
               gratitude and keep the fuckin music
               down.



     We CUT BACK to present and MEET JOHNNY STORY (think Pete
     Doherty meets Richard Ashcroft) or Posh John, posh, good
     looking, 25, alarmingly skinny and pale in a grey sort of
     way.

     He's still listening to "Bank Robber" dancing round with a
     couple of toy guns. His mate, who is not so posh, MEET PETE
     is sporting a balaclava at present. They've been cracking
     it up and the paraphernalia is everywhere.

     Johnny is standing in front of the mirror next to the mirror
     is the painting and oh he loves it. Pete rolls up his
     balaclava up and slams the stereo off.


                Just couldn't, it's got me,...that's
                what art does Pete, it gets you.


                You'd get a good few notes for that.
                Go on John, jog it on.


                You wouldn't understand.


                Why not?

                Because,.....You,.... Are street
                scum Pete.

     He does a quick moon walk, he's taking the piss.


                You're in need of an education, that's
                what you need, but your Dad never
                gave a shit about you did he? And
                that is why you are on the gear.
                Your gear is your surrogate father.


                Leave off John, what is this shrink
                time?


                Come on Pedro, share. I'm your
                sponsor, Doctor,...your dad if you're
                feeling a bit of regression coming
                on.
                    
                But first we should have a drink in
                our hands.



     Rough old bar, there are a couple of OLD WASTERS staggering
     around in the distance. Johnny and Pete have now got drinks
     in their hands.


                My Dad made me watch Bonanza every
                Sunday after church.

               You think? It wasn't all bad, he
               sometimes made me laugh too.


               Now we're getting somewhere. Did he
               interfere with you? You know, touch
               you inappropriate like?


               He tickled me if that's what you
               mean.


               Now that's it! That's what I was
               looking for, you see your Dad is a
               monster Pedro, a tickling monster.
                   
               Pedro's dad's a tickling monster!

     Johnny helps himself to some WASTERS drink at the bar for a
     quick refreshment. Understandably, the WASTER doesn't look
     happy and his three FRIENDS don't look happy either.


               That's my drink.

     Johnny gives the WASTER and his FRIENDS the masturbation
     signal without even bothering to look at them.


               Fuck you singalong, you're no help
               and stop calling me Pedro.

     The WASTER grabs a bottle from the bar ready to take some
     action. Johnny grabs a pencil from his top pocket, he holds
     it out like it's a knife. It's almost a joke.


               Come on boy, I'll have you and ya
               girlfriends! I'll do the lot of
               yazz.

     The WASTER is lost. Johnny is not physically scary, he's
     only scary because he's quite clearly mad. He looks like
     Robert Deniro in Taxi driver, mad as mars, he catches himself
     in the mirror, he likes what he sees. Ciggy falling out of
     his mouth, he sort of takes the piss out of himself, smiles
     "tough Johnny," the WASTER backs off he doesn't want junkie
     madness.

                    ridiculous eye brows)
               Junkies, I'll shit 'em!

     Johnny sits back down next to Pete.


               Did your Dad do anything else to you
               Pete?


               He hit me bad as well the slag.        Hit
               with a chain.

     Pete starts to lift up his shirt.


                    
               What are you doing? I'm not going
               to tickle you Pete, I'm not your
               Dad.

     He looks over and see's Pete has got the most horrific scars
     on his back. Johnny notice's them and stops in his tracks.
     Johnny walks back over to Pete and very tenderly touches his
     back, it feels horrible and bobbled.


                   
               I find that profoundly offensive
               Pedro. Two's up on a snout to show
               I care.

     He pulls out a ciggy.     Pete takes it.


               I used to think it had something to
               do with Bonanza.


               Your dad was jealous. Cos you dad
               isn't sure he's your dad, cos you
               don't look like him.


               Really?     What do I look like then?


               You have all the facial
               characteristics of North American
               native, Livapuddlian Indian.

                See your Dad thought you were a red
                Indian and Bonanza triggered your
                fathers unconscious feelings.


                Really?

     Pause.   Pete looks at Johnny,...Johnny starts to smile.


                You slag Story! I'm not telling you
                fuck all,...piss taker.

     Lenny pops it in his mouth, chews a while and spits out the
     middle. He turns to face ROMAN and MICKEY, he does not look
     happy.


                  How can we help?


                  Don't you have an act called Story
                  Time?


                  We did.


                  And isn't there a lead singer called

                  I would like to see him too, but
                  that might be tricky 'cos according

               And I shed a tear. I shed it for
               all those bone tops that read the
               papers and believe that shit.
                   
               Have you seen his body? Have you
               seen him smacked up and cracked up
               with his tongue on his chin and his
               cock in his hand, swinging from the
               rafters, like a real rock 'n' rolla?
                   
               No, you didn't did you? And nobody
               else fuckin did either, did they
               'cos he ain't dead. He's alive-alive-
               o somewhere selling cockles and
               mussels,...and a very important
               painting that doesn't belong to him.

               Sorry, but what has this got to do
               with us?


               You have twelve licenses within a
               jurisdiction which I control. You
               wanna play on, do what I tell you.
                   
               Now, I can tell what you're thinking.


               That there's not much you can't do?


               Slow down tinker bell, you'll never
               sing the same if ya teeth aren't

               That's not my style and especially
               not with genetics and all,...

     There is a look of confusion from Roman and Mickey.

     One Two walks into the speeler, he looks like a lost man.
     He looks over at the guys sitting around talking, they stop
     and look up.


               Where have you been? You were missed
               in court today. That's not very
               compassionate is it, didn't turn up
               for your amigos funeral.

     The phone rings in the back ground, Dolly answers it.


               Everybody else was there but you and
               I got the feeling you were the only
               person Handsome wanted to see.

     One Two turns a little nasty.


               What are you trying to say Fred?


               Eh?


               You wanna have it out now?

     From behind we see Handsome Bob and Mumbles walk into the
     Speeler. Handsome Bob sneaks up and put his hands over One
     Twos eyes.


               Guess whoooo?

     One Two spins round in major shock, he see's Bob and he
     doesn't like it. All the boys look on like One Two's going
     to hug him. He doesn't.


               The prosecution lost the paper work.
               I am offski, the case is closed.


                   
               Five years, you were supposed to
               get five fucking years!

     Everyone's in shock.    Dolly walks over and interrupts.

                  for you, she sounds very educated.

      One Two takes the call.


                How did you get this number?


                I can get any number, I work with
                numbers don't I?


                One point for initiative, two to
                tell me what's on your mind.



      Stella sits at her desk.

                I need a favor. My husbands having
                a party tonight and they need some
                "smarties" but they have nowhere to
                go. Look, I know it's a liberty,
                but I thought you might know people.
                Plus, I have another bit of work for
                you.
                     
                You can bring your friends. There
                will be interesting people - the
                rich and famous, the great and good.



      One Two looks through the crack in the door and sees Cookie.


                Let me see what I can do.



      One Two comes back into the room, he is still in disbelief.


                So Bob got off, big fucking deal.
                    (everyone looks a
                     little lost)
                I have a little bit of work for you
                Cookie we have a party to go to.



      Lenny has another large vodka in his hand, while Uri smiles.

     WHITE Revision   -   6-6-07                                46.




                Well thank you Uri, that's a real
                compliment from a man that obviously
                takes good care of himself.


                I suppose you're wondering why you
                are here?


                I assume you want to check that
                everything is still "kosher" at my
                end.
                     
                I was a little surprised you didn't
                come through at the appropriate time,
                but I reckon you have your reasons.
     Silence.


                I assume everything is still as you
                say,...Kosher?

     Pause. Lenny milks the moment and after a few seconds of
     mock thought, he speaks.


                Don't you worry Uri, that one's on
                me,...partners and all that, but I
                wouldn't like it to go south again,
                makes things difficult, if you know
                what I mean?


                I understand Lenny and I wouldn't
                like things to go wrong either.
                Which brings me conveniently to my
                next point. Ever since the painting,
                my lucky painting, hasn't been hanging
                on my wall, things have not
                been,....so lucky. I know this is a
                rude request because we have not
                concluded our business, but I feel
                as though I need it.

     Long pause while Lenny scrambles for an excuse.



     Lenny enters the car looking a little peachy.     Archy takes
     one look and grimaces.

                  Fuckin hell Len, he's given you that
                  bar tan again. You wanna leave that
                  vodka alone.

               Everything all right?


               No it's fuckin not all right, he
               want's his painting, his lucky
               painting.

     Archy looks a little worried.


               Oh, I see. That's a bit of a problem
               then isn't it?


               You should have seen his eyes I swore
               they changed color, went fuckin red
               they did.


               They don't care who's soil they are
               on that lot. They can buy half the
               country without breaking a sweat,
               you're small time to them. They
               could click their fingers and we'd
               be ether.

     Turning very nasty.


               You speak to me like that again and
               I'll cut your fuckin tongue out. I
               run this town, got that, me! Anybody
               who thinks he's rude enough, let 'em
               raise a finger, 'cos I'll take off
               his whole fuckin arm. Do you
               understand that Archy?
                   
               I said do YOU?

     Archy thinks his boss is going mad, but he doesn't let on.


               Yes, I do Len.



     The boys are still reeling from the news that Johnny is
     Lenny's son.

                  How about that then, Johnny Story's

               Would you want anyone to know that
               he was your Dad? Would we have taken
               him on if we had known?


               We're going to have to give him
               something, anything, a bed that's
               been slept in, a bone for his dog,
               some token of effort.


               We need to see Cookie.



     The door opens Mumbles, One Two, Cookie, and Fred stand there.
     A man, TOM in black tie opens the door, he looks posh and is
     in his boxers.

     He looks the boys up and down.                                     


               My name is Cookie.


               You must be with Stella?


               No, we're with the Grand Old Duke of
               York.


               Well you can't come in here, not                         
               without shaking my hand.                                 

     He offers it to One Two who accepts. Tom pulls it back at          
     the last minute and greases his hair back.                         


               So you're supposed to be a hard case

     Tom disappears inside where we see a mass of extremely drunk       
     TOFFS running around going wild in black tie.

                   Good evening gentlemen.

      All the boys give it the "oh you sly one" to One Two. There's
      a gathering of TOFFS starting to cluster, they're waiting to
      be fed. A semi naked WAITER appears with a drinks tray.


                   Help yourselves to drinks.

                   So! Who the man?


                   I think that's your cue Cookie.
      Cookie takes his cue.                                               


                   Come on then kids, get in a nice
                   orderly line and we'll get the party
                   started.

      The boys all head various ways into the party



      We see One Two walking through the party, when he runs into
      Handsome.


                   What the fuck are you doing here?


                   Well all the chaps were coming and I
                   didn't have any plans tonight did I?
                   Thought I might celebrate a little,
                   do you mind?


                   Yes I do fuckin mind. Now listen
                   Bob, what happened last night is our
                   little secret all right and it was
                   only cos you were supposed to be
                   doing your time, right? You tell
                   anybody and I swear to God,.... I
                   swear to God. Well fuck it Bob, I
                   think you understand.

      As One Two walks away he runs into Tom again who stands in          
      his way.

      One Two gives him the quick ONE TWO punch, Tom is knocked           
      out cold, he catches him standing up and lowers him to the          
      floor. One Two walks off.

      We CUT TO Mumbles on the sofa who is watching One Two, he         
      grimaces. Bertie is next to him.                                  


                And that's why they call him One

      Mumbles smiles and flicks his cigar ash into Bertie's glass.
      He knows he's a poof and keeps his eyes on him a second too
      long just to get Bertie excited.


                Does she now?


                So is your friend part of the wild
                bunch?

      Bertie is talking about Handsome and Mumbles knows it.


                That young man is the greatest gun
                slinger in town.


                    
                Then how come I don't know him?
                    
                I know all about your type.


                How is that then?

                I'm a criminal lawyer,..and I know a
                secret about your part of town.


                What secrets that then?


                You have an informer in your neck of
                the woods.


                Oh yeah, so what's his name?


                You have to pay for secrets.

                   That's not nice, but while your at
                   it, what's the price?


                       
                   I want to meet the gun slinger.

      Mumbles looks over to Handsome.



      CUT TO One two who has just run into Stella, there is a man
      holding a tray of drinks next to them.


                   Drink?

                   Large one,...Dance?


                   So, you're a dancer?


                   Am I a dancer? Shall we put the
                   record straight?

      One Two makes room in front of him and starts to dance
      relativity badly. You get the feeling he probably could
      dance, but he just can't be bothered to make an effort.


                   You see it's all in the genes.
                       
                   My Dad was a dancer and his Dad before
                   that so gradually it's percolated
                   the old DNA. You not joining me?

                   Sure, I like to dance.

      She stands up and dances just like him.

                   Hello, I can sense a little
                   competition. So what you got for
                   me?


                   The same job's back on again.


                   Oh yea?
                       
                   Don't throw my rhythm.


                   Same time, same place, same money.


                   What about security?


                   Same as before, but they're not my
                   accountants. A couple of
                   their's,..other than that, should be
                   just the same.



        We CUT TO Mumbles who has gone up to Handsome.


                   Handsome, I got a job for you.    See
                   that man on the couch.


                   The one that's staring at us?    How
                   can I miss him.


                   Do me a favor, chat him up.


                   Fuck off what do think I am?


                   He's some big wig lawyer who knows
                   about an informer in our part of
                   town and since you were just looking
                   at a five stretch, I thought you
                   might be interested.

      Handsome gets the picture and heads over to Bertie.       One Two     
      appears and approaches Mumbles.


                   We got another job on, same as before.

                   It's all go around here isn't it?
                   Den of iniquity this place is. You
                   know your old lady, well her big
                   time lawyer husband he's a beard got
                   a crush on the Handsome.


                   What are you talking about?


                   Put it this way, I don't think they
                   married for love.


                   I gotta get a breath of fresh air.


      We CUT TO to Handsome who has come to sit on the same sofa
      as Bertie.


                   So, I hear you have a secret, but
                   you look like you might have more
                   than one. Why don't you confess?


                   I don't want to talk about work.


                   If you tell me who the informer is,
                   we will talk about whatever you want
                   to, anyway, you don't have to tell
                   me anything. If he's an informer
                   you'll have his depositions and poems.                  


                   My, my not just a pretty face. How
                   do you know about those sort of
                   things?

      Handsome scribbles out his number on a piece of paper, and
      gives it to Bertie.


                   Let's have a drink during the week,
                   and I'll tell you all about it, all
                   I need is a little bit of paper work.

      One Two is on his way out the door when Cookie stops him.


                   Oi One Two, I am going to make a
                   killing out of this lot, they've
                   definitely got more money than brains.
                       
                   I owe you one boyo.



      Johnny is watching cartoons trying to skin up a joint using
      a page of a book, he puts it down in frustration. Pete walks
      in, grabs the picture from it's place and starts to walk
      out. Johnny squints.


                   Pedro?   Come back here.

      Pete stops in his tracks.


                   Where do you think you are going
                   with that painting?


                       
                   You never said it was your Dad's or
                   whatever you wanna call him. You
                   gotta give it back John people are
                   looking for it, bad people. The
                   streets are alive with the sound of
                   pain.


                   You may have a point Pete, but I
                   can't give it up. You know why?


                   No, why?


                   Meet me in the pub in two minutes.



      Johnny walks in and approaches the BARMAN.        He doesn't like
      Johnny.


                   What do you want?

                  Now, now no need for that tone bar
                  steward. I am merely on mission to
                  acquire a shot of your finest Scotch
                  and a packet of your,...
                      
                  Cheapest rolling paper.


                  Green or red?


                  King size of course - along with a
                  packet of your shiniest coffin nails.

     The BARMAN reaches for a pack of cigarettes.


                  Don't make a scene in here boy.

     Johnny puts a large note on the bar.


                  Put the change in the blind box my
                  good man and remember,...

     He leans into the bar and shuts one eye.


                  "In the kingdom of the blind, the
                  one eyed man is king"

     The BARMAN is left with his mouth open. Johnny walks to the
     piano to drink his Scotch. There are a few beer mats on the
     piano, Johnny wipes the mats off with a glide of his hand
     and they fall to the floor. He raises the lid, coughs,
     composes himself, and extends his hands through his sleeves.
     He hits the first note and takes his scotch down in one. A
     few of the old PUNTERS turn around. Johnny starts to play
     the most beautiful classical music with his eyes shut. Pete
     walks in, approaches Johnny and sits with him. He likes it
     when he plays. Johnny doesn't even need to see him to know
     that he's there.


                  You see that pack of Virginia killing
                  sticks at the end of the piano?

     We SEE the pack of cigarette's on the piano.


                  Yeah.

      Pete picks up the pack as Johnny keeps his eyes shut. The
      following story is a montage of pack shots of the cigarette
      box, intercut with Johnny's delicate fingers stroking the
      keys.


                You will notice that one of your
                personalities is seduced by the
                illusions of grandeur. A "gold"
                packet of "king" size and with a
                "regal" insignia. An attractive
                implication toward glamour and wealth,
                a subtle suggestion that cigarettes
                are indeed your "royal" and loyal
                friends. And that Pete,...is a lie.
                    
                Your other personality is trying to
                draw your attention to the flip side
                of the discussion. Written in boring,
                bold, black and white is the
                statement, that these neat little
                soldiers of death, are in fact, trying
                to "kill you." And that Pete,...is
                the truth.
                    
                Beauty is a beguiling call to death
                and I am addicted to the sweet siren
                of its pitch. And that,..is why,..you
                and I love the crack, and that is
                also why I can not,.. give that
                painting back.

      He opens his eyes and looks at Pete, his cigarette has gone
      out.


                Now, please pass me a light.


                    
                Oh you are something special Johnny
                Story.

      Johnny smiles and puts him in a head lock, they fall to the
      floor wrestling.





      One Two and Mumbles are here eating and holding their
      implements of destruction to be used on the next "job" we

                   We'll use rock salt in the shot gun
                   cartridges. Slip 'em into the
                   revolver, if it starts getting large,
                   we'll bang a couple in to 'em and
                   that'll slow 'em down. They won't
                   know the difference between lead or
                   salt and of course Bob's driving.


                   I don't want to use Bob.


                   What? He's our driver, the A-teams

                   What's happened between you and Bob?

      There's a bit of a pause.


                   I think there might be something
                   about Bob you don't know Mumbles.


                   What's that then?       That he's a poof?


                   What?   Eh?   How did you know?


                   Everybody knows he's a flamer, you're

                   What are you talking about, I am

                   Did he make a pass at you, is this
                   what this is all about?


                   Yes, he fuckin did.


                   Ok so what's the problem? It was
                   supposed to be his last night so you
                   "took care" of him, that's what
                   friends do for one another, well
                   done, I won't tell the chaps.

                What, there's more?

                 No, it was Bob around there six times
                 a week without fail making sure she
                 was looked after. You tore your
                 mums heart out when you went away
                 and Bob did his best to put it back.
                     
                 I tell you something One Two, if I
                 could be half the human that Bob is
                 and the price was being a poof, I'd
                 think about it.
                     
                 Not for too long, but I'd have to
                 think about it.


                 He looked after my Mum, how come he

       Roman and Mickey have got a BAND on stage and the place is
       filling up. Roman is on the phone looking concerned as Mickey
       looks on, he puts the phone down.

       We CUT TO our BAND playing on stage, modern young punksters,
       Arctic Monkey types. Plenty of attitude.

     There is a long line of people outside Roman and Mickey's
     venue. Johnny and Pete hustle their way through the crowd,
     the BOUNCER pulls them up.


               Oi you, what do you think you're
               doing?


               What do you think we're doing?   We're
               trying to get in.


               Go home wasters, costs money to get
               in here.

               Yes my good man, I am aware of that.

     Johnny goes for his money, but the BOUNCER pushes him on.




               What's wrong with you?


               Get that Archy on the phone, I think
               we've got a problem.

     WE CUT to the BAND smashing away.



     The BOUNCER is holding Johnny and Pete back.


               Run along junkies.


               Oi looky, but no touchy.

     Johnny pushes the BOUNCERS arm away. The BOUNCER retorts
     with a slap round the cheek. Pete won't stand for that, he
     goes for the BOUNCER in a pathetic junkie way.


               Get off him you slag, he's class.

     The BOUNCER smashes a big bouncer punch right on Pete's nose.
     Pete shoots back past Johnny and lays in the road, the line
     starts clapping.

     Roman is on the phone with Archy, we cut to them mid
     conversation.


                 Mr. Archy,....
                     
                 I hear you, but you can't just shut
                 us down! I've got an act on.



     Johnny stands over Pete, he notices Johnny's face. Pete's
     seen this before, he's changing like a madmen about to
     explode.


                     
                 Leave it John, I'm happy, I'm all
                 right down here mate. Let's call it
                 a night eh?


                 I'll show em' fuckin happy.



     We hear the BAND is starting to get louder and faster.


                 I understand, we'll find him,..
                     
                 But I have to keep the club open!   I
                 have four hundred people in here!
                     
                 Don't you dare shut us down!


     Johnny makes for the BOUNCER with menace, the BOUNCER looks
     at Johnny coming and smiles.


                 Fancy some more talent boy?

     Johnny   keeps coming, he's tiny in comparison, the BOUNCER
     stands   and waits - he's ready. Johnny gives the old two
     finger   poke to the eyes, the BOUNCER screams in pain and
     swings   into the ether

     Johnny pulls out his signature pencils.

                  Jog on boy, before I grind your bones
                  to make my bread.

     Without a hesitation Johnny sticks the pencils into the
     BOUNCERS leg, it's quite nasty. The BOUNCER stumbles forward
     like a wounded elephant, it's David and Goliath. Johnny's
     smart, he knows how to do this properly.


                  Oh I'm sorry did that hurt?   Here
                  let me help you up.


     Mickey walks back to Roman.


                      
                  They're trying to shut us down!

     CUT TO THE BAND going even madder - the crowd is loving it.



     Johnny picks up a trash bin lid and starts giving it to the
     bouncer. The crowd dances around this wounded beast.


                  What was that about grinding bones?




                  If we want to keep the licence and
                  the lights on, we need to find Johnny

     Mickey looks at the security camera and sees chaos.


                  There is a revolution taking place
                  outside.

     The BAND is still going when all of a sudden the lights get
     pulled, we cut to black.

                  Joke to be inserted by Cookie.

     The table laughs, Roman and Mickey approach.


                  Hello, it's Roman and Mickey, what
                  are you doing here boys?

                  We need to find Johnny Story.


                  Well, you should be the first to
                  know this, but isn't he,...


                  You know and I know nothing kills
                  Johnny.

                  It's an unpleasant place called "curl
                  up and die." Might sound like a
                  hair salon, but it don't fuckin look
                  like one I can tell ya. It's a
                  horrible sight and a terrible sound
                  listening to a man sucking his soul
                  through the hole in "the pipe" and
                  even worse when he tries to tear it
                  back.
                      
                  I've been there, I've done that,...
                  then I nailed that demon in a smoke
                  proof coffin and I did it all with
                  Johnny. I love that man, he's what
                  you call class..and if you would use
                  your heads, you would love him too.
                  You know his music sales have gone
                  up a thousand percent in two weeks.

     We SEE inside the Range Rover where there is a DRIVER with
     our TWO CHECHNYANS. The CHECHNYANS have suitcases handcuffed
     to their wrists. They speak in their native tongue.


               Victor is Uri's right hand man, we
               served together for four years in
               Chechnya. We used to have a good
               time together, he's a real soldier,
               strong, hard, we made much trouble.
               I saved his life and he saved mine
               many times,...

     CHECHNYAN 1 pulls up his sleeve to reveal a massive tattoo.
     His arm is filled with slash marks on it.

               Caught in tank tracks!      He pulled me
               out and this one,...

     He unbuckles his trousers and shows a massive gouge in his
     thigh.


               Stem grenade.


               I have one of those,...

     CHECHNYAN 2 pulls up his trouser leg to reveal massive scars
     on his shin.


               How many of these have you got?

       SMASH!!!! Their car is smashed into a tailspin, by Handsome
       Bob's truck. The Range Rover eventually lands on it's side,
       steam, spinning wheels, smoke, and glass is everywhere.

      Bob jumps out of his truck and runs down to the second getaway
      car waiting. We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their
      car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are
      carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly
      opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the
      window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans
      in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's
      wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles
      uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free.


                There's another case, grab it.

      One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1.
      As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the
      car by CHECHNYAN 2.


                The bastard's still kicking.     Mace
                him, mace him!

      Mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays
      mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes.


                Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot,
                the Guerrilla!

      CHECHNYAN 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength
      and is still pulling One Two into the car with him. We can
      SEE Bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car
      looking concerned.


                Shoot him, shoot him, the bastards
                going to eat me!
      Mumbles pulls out a revolver, sticks it in the window and
      fires it into CHECHNYAN 2's leg. This just aggravates the

                   In his arms!

      Bang.


                   Arhhhhhhhhhhh.     That's my fuckin
                   arm!

      One Two manages to head butt CHECHNYAN 2 and goes back to
      reclaiming the case from CHECHNYAN 1. He pulls it out and
      Mumbles cuts the chain. One Two can't see a thing.


                   Let's go, we've got it.


                   Give me a hand, you've blinded me!
      Major confusion is setting in. They run back to their car,
      which is still running, Mumbles shoves One Two into the back
      and jumps in the drivers seat.


                   Go, go, go, go!!!!!!

      With his window open, Mumbles wheel spins out of the situation
      and turns to check on One Two. From out of nowhere a very
      large CHECHNYAN arm shoots through the window and puts Mumbles
      in a neck lock. The CHECHNYAN 2 is holding on and not letting
      go.

      The car tears across the road and enters a shop window that
      has a mezzanine. The car comes to a halt on a precarious
      ledge, it's dangling with the CHECHNYAN 2 still not letting
      go.




                   Give me the gun.

      One Two can get a clear shot into the CHECHNYAN 2's side.
      He shots him once, CHECHNYAN 2 doesn't move, twice, three
      times, four times, he finally lets go and falls down on the
      floor.


                   Shit, what are these two made out
                   of?

      Mumbles is coughing and slowly coming back to life.

               Grab my hand, we're getting out of
               here.


               Who's got the cases?


               I've got 'em.

     As they get out of the car, WE SEE CHECHNYAN 1 has now made
     his way down the street. He is punch drunk with mace in his
     eyes, but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket. The
     boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but CHECHNYAN 1
     is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. He
     lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who
     all hit the deck. The magazine runs dry, CHECHNYAN 1 dips
     into his belt to extract a fresh one. Mumbles see's his
     opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to
     him, runs at CHECHNYAN 1 and takes a massive swipe at his
     head. CHECHNYAN 1 goes down, but he has already put in a
     new magazine. Mumbles is still carrying the cases, One Two
     is attached to his arm.


               Shoot him Mumbles or we won't get
               out of this!


               I can't fuckin shoot him, you do it.

     A baseball smashes into Mumbles face, he goes down, and he's
     out. CHECHNYAN 2 has appeared carrying a metal baseball
     bat. One Two picks up the machine gun.


               Stop or I'll shoot!

     CHECHNYAN 2 will not stop, he just keeps on coming.


               I mean it, get down,...get down!

     CHECHNYAN 2 keeps coming, One Two doesn't want to do it but
     he has to. He lets off twenty three bullets into the
     CHECHNYAN 2's chest, the CHECHNYAN is knocked back and
     disappears over the mezzanine. One Two is in shock, he has
     never killed a man. He stands there numb.


                   (who has come back to
                    life)
               I got the cases, now let go.

               Now One Two, now!

     They make their way to the entrance. There is a crowd of
     PEOPLE gathered, a great "ohhhhhhhh" goes up.




               Where's Bob?

     Beep. Beep. A car slowly makes it way through the crowd.
     It pulls up and the boys pile in, what's left of them. They
     pull away from the sports shop.



     Bob looks in his mirror, he can see a gun being raised, there
     is someone on the trunk.


               Down.

     He slams on the brakes. CHECHNYAN 2 goes flying over the
     roof, but stops himself hitting the road by perforating the
     hood with his massive knife. He proceeds to perforate the
     wind screen with another knife that he extracts and (because
     of laminate) starts to saw through the wind screen. The
     boys are in horror.


               Abandon ship!



     One Two gets caught in a head lock by CHECHNYAN 2, they
     struggle. Mumbles hits the CHECHNYAN from behind with a car
     Jack and CHECHNYAN 2 goes down again. One Two's eyes have
     just about come back.

               Run!     Run for your lives.

     The crew split in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. Bob takes the cases
     and plucks some poor bystander out of their car and takes
     off. Mumbles disappears another way. CHECHNYAN 2 is up and
     follows One Two - terminator style, a foot chase begins.
     One Two, split from the group and being pursued, jumps over
     a wall.

     One Two has ended up on a railway track. He turns back, why
     should CHECHNYAN 2 chase him, he hasn't got the money. But
     no, CHECHNYAN 2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping
     in the wind, and coming after him. One Two finds his strength
     this is his world, the world of the runner - he's off down
     the tracks.

     The pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a
     pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. The run goes
     on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can
     see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and
     sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and
     starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2
     is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his
     eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will
     remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he
     almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to
     him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.

     One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from
     a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the
     machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than
     One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the
     moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the
     moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the
     moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he
     can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit."
     This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play. He drifts
     in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and
     runs and runs. Up, down, through and in.



     We see Mumbles has caught up with One Two along side the
     tracks. He is on a motorbike that he has stolen.


                  Get on!

     One Two jumps on the back and they speed away leaving our
     Chechnyan's behind.


     We are on another one of Uri's construction sites, Lenny is
     here to do the money exchange, again.


                  I will have that painting   with you
                  in a couple of days Uri.    It got
                  locked up with some other   goods of
                  mine, I wanted to keep it   safe, but
                  Archy lost the key to the   lock.
                  Didn't you Arch?

     Archy nods like an idiot.

                  Now, I'm not being funny Uri, but I
                  have a payment to make. So if there
                  is any chance that I could get the
                  money.

      Victor walks up, there is something wrong.


                    
                I need to speak to you Uri.



      Uri concludes the meeting with Lenny and Archy and they walk
      to the exit where Turbo is waiting by the door. Something
      has obviously just happened.


                Something wrong with these immigrants
                Arch, I don't fuckin trust 'em.
                We're being set up, don't know how,
                but something's wrong, I can smell
                it with my sniffer. I thought he
                was made of fuckin money, not too
                happy about flashing it around here
                though is he?



      Uri watches Lenny walk off.


                He is the only one that knows.


                He doesn't have the balls or the
                brains.


                He's a crook, a small time back
                handing crook. Once could be a
                coincidence, but twice and the
                painting - your "lucky painting" I
                think he is trying to make a fool
                out of you.



      One Two walks into the restaurant with Handsome Bob. One
      Two is bashed to a pulp, but he's wearing a nice suit and
      carrying a bag full of money. There is a slight silence as
      his appearance arrests conversations. Handsome waits near
      the entrance and One Two sits down across from Stella, there
      is a pause. The odd PERSON passes and double takes at One
      Two.


                Oh my God, are you all right?

                 Don't you want to know what happened?


                 I know what happened, it's been all
                 over the news, but I didn't
                 realize,...


                 You didn't say anything about guns,..
                 machine guns with war criminals stuck
                 to the trigger.

                 I am sorry I didn't know, but
                 shouldn't you have taken precautions?


                 I'll leave your bag under the table
                 all right?
                     
                 But this isn't about the money is
                 it? I saw you there on that last
                 job. At first I thought it was
                 curiosity,..

      CUT BACK TO THE ROBBERY we see Stella in her car that One
      Two had seen, but we didn't.


                 But then I realized what was going
                 on. You don't need the money, you
                 liked the rush. Your old man, can't
                 give you the action can he?
                     
                 Good-bye sweetheart you're too
                 dangerous for me.

      He gets up and limps out.



      One Two and Handsome get into the car where Mumbles, nursing
      his own wounds, is already waiting. Handsome sits in the
      drivers seat when his phone goes.


                 Is that you Bertie?

                   What's happening about that paper
                   work?


                   I am busy tonight, but Monday looks
                   good. I'll leave the papers at my

                   I'll be round in a jiffy and I'll
                   see you Monday.
      The phone goes down, One Two narrows his eyes.


                   You are scary good at that.


                   Do you miss it?

      Lenny is walking down the main corridor, he's a man on a
      mission. Archy is next to him, not looking so enthusiastic.

                   Arch I don't care if he's fuckin
                   busy, if we call, he answers, that's

      The Councilor is walking down the corridor he's with some of

                   I can't do it, you've left it too
                   long Lenny. You want something that
                   the city has a ruling against,
                   something they said they wouldn't
                   give permission to build.

                   they'd never build, how did that

                   can't do it this time.

      Lenny grabs the Councilor by the bollocks and pushes him up
      against the wall.

      out a lot of money too much for Malcolm to say no to.

                   I'll have that painting in a couple
                   of days Uri, trust me on that.

      Uri's not sure about that last statement.


                   You like it out here Lenny?


                   Can't beat the great outdoors can
                   you Uri? I can't understand it, not
                   a soul out here.


                   That's because I have had the course
                   cleared for us Lenny, we are not
                   going to be disturbed.

                   Oh that's good, I love a clear fair
                   way, that's a bitta me that Uri.
                   Nothing worse than being jogged on
                   by blind tourists swinging a stick
                   on a Sunday.


                   What are we going to do Lenny? Every
                   time I am about to make my payment
                   something dishonest happens.
                       
                   You, wouldn't know anything about
                   that, would you?

      Clearly shifting gears, could he be saying what he thinks.


                   Excuse me? Are you trying to say
                   something Uri?


                   I am not trying Lenny, I am saying
                   something.

      Lenny is not having any of this, after all he's "top dog."


                   I think you forget who you are
                   speaking to you insolent bastard.
                   You forget where you are you fuckin
                   immigrant. This is my land, my fuckin
                   show, I run this tow,....

      Victor has extracted a five iron from out of the golf bag
      and has decided to break both of Lenny's legs in ten different
      places. Lenny screams in unimaginable agony, writhing on
      the green. Uri almost ignores the activity.

                 I have to go now Lenny, I am having
                 lunch with the Councilor, your
                 Councilor. This, as you know, is
                 the ninth hole and it is a long crawl
                 back to your car. You should make
                 it by sunrise, just in time to bring
                 me my "lucky picture." I want it
                 back do you hear me?

      Victor kicks him.


                 Yes,..yes.


                 After that, I don't want to hear
                 from you again, disappear do you
                 understand me Lenny?
                     (Victor stands on his
                      broken legs arrrrgh)
                 Lenny?


                 Yes, yes, I understand.

      Victor dips into his Lenny's pocket and extracts his phone.


                 Times just change.
                     
                 Good bye Lenny.

      He gets into the buggy with Victor and drives off.



      One Two comes in and closes the door behind him.

      He looks down on the floor and there is THE PAINTING, we see
      a large note on it that says.

      "Let myself in, thought your lady would like the painting.
      Love, Cookie"

      The door bell rings, he opens it and there stands Stella.
      She walks in straight past One Two, he turns round with his
      mouth open, she gently slaps it shut and kisses him.



      We are outside Bertie's office - Handsome opens the car door
      and jumps in, he's holding a brown envelope.

      Mumbles is waiting there.

      One Two is sitting on the bed that has been torn apart.
      He's in his boxer shorts with a ciggy in his mouth. Stella
      is walking toward the bathroom, the phone rings.


                 Yeah?



      We see Mumbles and Handsome driving they are talking on the
      speaker phone.


                 We've found out about that informer.
                 Your lady "the beard," her old man
                 came through.


                 What?


                 It's here in my hands, THE informer,
                 the one responsible for all the
                 sentences we have been seeing - all
                 of 'em, including me.


                 Well, who is it then?


                 Who's Sidney Shaw?




                 Sidney Shaw is a pseudonym you idiot,
                 they never use the real name. Get
                 around here and let me have a look.



      A gang of VILLAINS are lining the corridor, Archy walks
      through them.



      Lenny is here with a NURSE.


                 Don't try and move it'll be too
                 painful before tonight.

                   Give me the water, Aaaaaahhhhh,..


                   I told you not to move.

      Archy walks into the room.

                Broke my legs in four places Archy,
                did you hear that? The bastard's
                made me limp for the rest of my days.


                What do you want me to do?

      Lenny is clearly distressed, his confidence has gone.


                I need that picture Archy, I need it
                bad.


                I'll get it, don't you worry and I
                think I can do better than that.
      This catches his attention.


                What?


                Someone has been at the Russian's
                money, a couple of silly gun
                slingers,..he wasn't making up
                stories.


                What?


                You know 'em and you don't like 'em
                either.


                I ain't playing fuckin games here
                Arch look at me, who?


                Mumbles, Bob and One Two.



      Stella walks out of the bathroom, she looks immaculate.


                Look at you, good as new.


                I have to go now.

                   Fancy sharing some dancing lessons
                   with me later in the week, a bitta
                   the 'ol salsa?








      WHITE Revision   -   6-6-07                               82.




                    
                I'll take you up on that.


                I got something for you. Thought
                you might like it, seeing as you
                like paintings and all.
                    
                There, it's on floor.

      Leant up against the wall is the lucky painting, she stops
      and looks at it, the camera slowly creeps into her face. We
      observe One Two looking for a reaction.


                Like it?

                You have very good taste,...Mr One
                Two.

      She picks up the painting and turns smiling.


                Good bye.

      With that she is off and out the door. One Two grabs the
      70s retro headphones above his head and slaps them on his
      ears. He presses the remote control and the music kicks in.



      Mickey and Roman approach the crack house door and flick up
      the letter box. They see a string hanging, they pull it and
      down comes a key.



      Roman and Mickey walk in to see Johnny slouched and watching
      TV, more silly cartoons. He's got his top off and he's
      smoking a ciggy. His feet are resting on an old chair and
      Pete is asleep next to him. Johnny hardly moves.


                So why did you call Johnny?


                Sorry, Johnny's not home right now,
                but the pipe is and the pipe says
                that Johnny heard you were getting
                in trouble boys.

      Roman gives a slight roll of the eyes.




      WHITE Revision    -   6-6-07                                83.




                   Look, whoever I am talking to please
                   relay the message to Johnny. His
                   Dad, his jack in the box surprise
                   gangster Daddy, paid us a visit.
                   Shut down a few of our venues and he
                   intends to shut down a few more unless
                   Mr Story puts in an appearance.


                   Why are you talking to a pipe Roman?
                   You're madder than I am.


                   Come back Johnny, come back home.


                   But home is where your head is and I
                   don't feel at home in my head.
                       
                   Come back Johnny!

      Johnny smiles and pulls out a gun from under his arse. He
      points it at Roman, waits until he knows they feel it and
      pulls the trigger.

      It's a lighter. He relights his splif, hot hash dropping on
      his chest, he ignores it.


                   I bet our Lenny gave you the "I'm
                   his old man" speech didn't he?
                       
                   I've seen jelly fish with closer DNA
                   than that slag. Now Johnny will
                   come quietly, but you might have a
                   couple of problems with the pipe.
                       
                   Come on boys, buy us both a cup of
                   tea. No need for any noise, let
                   Pete sleep on.



      One Two has still got the headphones on, his eyes shut and
      he's tapping his knees. All of a sudden the music stops
      coming out of the headset and is now filling the room, someone
      else is here.



      WE CUT BACK to an earlier scene that we weren't a part of
      until now.

      Victor is talking to a man, we can't see who it is.








      WHITE Revision    -    6-6-07                           84.




                Uri is a man born with nothing, carved
                his way up the hard way, he's smart,
                young and only one thing will stop
                him from reaching his goals,...women.
                And this woman has become a problem.
                    
                My job is to protect Uri and in this
                department he needs protecting, I
                don't like her or trust her and I
                want you to follow that snake.

      We reveal it's CHECHNYAN 1 our war criminal who is looking
      battered from the beating the day before.


                Leave it with me Victor.



      We go back to the scene at the restaurant from a different
      perspective. The two CHECHNYAN'S see One Two and Handsome
      Bob walk out of the restaurant, they two look at one another,
      their brows steel.



      CUT BACK to present with the music being cut off from One
      Two's head phones. He opens his eyes, on his throat lies a
      very long and sharp knife. The two CHECHNYANS have entered
      the room and pulled the wire out of the machine. CHECHNYAN
      1 is sitting on a chair next to One Two, he's the one with
      the blade. He smiles, One Two doesn't.



      Archy approaches the door with Danny behind, he pushes it,
      it opens. Concerned, he pulls out a shooter, so does Danny,
      they go in.



      The music is very loud, it's Russian. Archy and Danny make
      their way to it's source, up the stairs, to the bedroom door.
      The base thumps out. Archy tries the handle, it turns, he
      pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we
      reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little
      amused.

      Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head
      is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle
      of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles
      uselessly.

      On the floor facing the other direction is our pretty much
      naked Chechnyan doing a traditional Chechnyan dance, which
      involves lots of extended leg action.








      WHITE Revision   -   6-6-07                                   85.



      He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from
      his military hat. He is "having much fun." His massive
      frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two
      previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly
      dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all
      sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by
      the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused.
      He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking
      distressed. Silence ensues.


                Is this a bad time One Two?


                    
                Emmm, emmmmmmmmmmmm.


                Shall we come back later?


                    (still unable to say
                     anything)
                Emmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

      The Chechnyans make a quick move, their last ever.        We hear
      FOUR shots ring out quickly.



      Handsome Bob and Mumbles pull up and get out. Handsome Bob
      puts the paper work in his top pocket and bangs on the front
      door.



      One Two is being wrapped up in a carpet on the floor. He's
      still emmmmmmmmming and wriggling. We hear Handsome Bob and
      Mumbles at the front.

                One Two, it's us.

      Archy pays no attention to the door yet, he is on the phone
      to Lenny.


                Bring 'em to the warehouse and don't
                hurt 'em until I've spoken to 'em,
                all right?


                All right Lenny, I got a call waiting
                here, I'll see ya at the show.

                Hello?



      Roman and Mickey are still here with Johnny.    Roman speaks.


                Archy?



      Archy leans against a ROLLSROYCE with another HEAVY. Young
      Johnny walks up, he's wearing tales and a bow tie, he's with
      two of his toffy school FRIENDS.


                Hello Archy.

                Johnny, you do look the part.


                Show us your guns Uncle Arch, I told
                the boys all about it.


                Shut up and get in the car.

      Archy throws Johnny a packet of rolos and turns to get in
      the car. As he turns, Johnny lifts up the back of his sports
      jacket and steals his gun. The two FRIENDS are in shock,
      needless to say so is Archy. Johnny holds it on his two
      friends.


                Give us your money boys.
      Archy grabs the gun and hits Johnny on the back of the head,
      not too hard.


                You little swine,... now get in the
                car.

      Archy puts the gun away and looks at the two shocked school
      friends. He gently slaps them on the cheek in an intimidating
      way and gives them a tener.


                Be good boys, you never know who's
                watching.

                   You wanna take the stairs or the
                   elevator Mr Cole?

      Lenny's in a wheelchair, he looks at Bandy.


                   Come here Bandy.

      Bandy comes near, Lenny takes a sniff.


                   You been drinking again?


                   No,....Mr Cole.

      Lenny slaps him.

                   Think before you drink and before
                   you drive me mad Bandy.

      Bandy goes back to his position of pushing the boss towards
      the elevator.



      Johnny, Roman and Mickey walk toward the entrance.


                   Don't worry boys, nothing to be
                   nervous about, some of my Dad's best
                   friends ended up here.

      Archy arrives with a couple of old carpets, One Two, Mumbles
      and Handsome Bob are wrapped inside.


                   Hello Arch, wrapped up in a carpet
                   just like the old days?
                       
                   What is it today? The rack? The
                   garotte? Or is it the old cray fish
                   trap?


                   Still full of hot air Johnny.

      They walk inside the warehouse doors, Danny follows with the
      carpets.

                   You always were loyal - no dog like
                   a loyal dog.

                   Don't hit me Archy, I'm a singer not
                   a fighter.
                        
                   I've just the remedy for you, a story,
                   a Johnny Story and it's all about
                   you.
      Archy presses a button to call the elevator.       They wait.


                   I don't want to hear it.


                   Sorry, that's right get into
                   character.
                       
                   Look at him boys, scary ain't he?

      Roman and Mickey don't like any of this.


                   That's what four years inside does
                   to a man, eats his soul and when
                   it's all gone it makes a man quite
                   scary. Ever wondered how you got
                   there? Ever wondered what grass
                   informed on you?

      The elevator arrives and they all pile in, including the
      rugs with One Two, Mumbles and Handsome Bob.



      A noise comes from one of the carpets.


                   So who we got in there? Anyone I
                   know? Anyone famous? That's right
                   it's only a job, isn't it? Just
                   being loyal, just following orders.

      Archy turns and slaps him the famous "Archy slap" it's nasty,
      Archy's getting wound up.


                Shut it, otherwise you will get hurt.

      His face has been slapped into the direction of Roman and
      Mickey. Johnny keeps his head still,...


                That, Roman and Mickey, is the famous
                Archy slap. I have been magically
                transported straight back to my
                childhood.

      He speaks next in a little boys voice, he's taking the piss.


                Don't turn Archy in, he's your friend,
                he's loyal, just like the dog.

      He changes to impersonate Lenny, its deep and over the top.


                Shut up boy, don't stick your nose
                where it don't belong otherwise I'll
                chop it off.
                    
                But you can't do it to Uncle Arch, I
                love him.
                    
                Needs a little lesson though don't
                he? Left his station hasn't he? A
                little time inside to remember who
                the boss is.

      Archy straightens his tie to remain calm, but can't take it
      any longer. He picks Johnny up and slams him against the
      wall.

                    
                Shut it, you hear me or I'll do ya
                myself, you poisonous little fucker!


                    
                Don't hurt me Arch, I'm only little.



      The elevator door opens and we see skinny Johnny stuck up in
      the air held by Archy. Danny looks on a bit disturbed.

                   Put him down Arch, he's only little.

      Archy drops him, his wires crossed.        He needs a little time
      to think.

      Johnny is off out of the elevator walking away happy as a
      clam. Back to Archy in the elevator.


                   You all right?     You look a little
                   green.


                       
                   Fine, roll out the carpets.


      Johnny comes bowling in like a 'rocknrolla' coming on to
      stage. He spots Lenny.


                   Sidney!   Nice wheels.

      Archy comes in with Danny and the carpets, Handsome Bob hears
      this, is Lenny Cole the Sidney Shaw?


                   Sorry about the painting, needed the
                   cash for a little bit of the old
                   "dusty show bizzzzzzzz."
                       
                   So, it's gone now, lost in the world
                   of degenerate and stoned no hopers,
                   never to be seen again by the eye of
                   a clean soul.

      There is a pause while Lenny considers just shooting him.
      He changes his tone, he gets serious and slow.


                   Tell me, what are you boy if you are
                   not poison? Look what you've left
                   behind you. Your Dad couldn't even
                   bear the sight ya, no wonder he fucked
                   off and left me to pick up the pieces,
                   but that wasn't enough for you was
                   it? No, had to drive your mum into
                   a bottle of pills and house full of
                   nutters. All she got then was a hot
                   bath a ice cold razor, why?
                       
                   Cos your poison Johnny, that's why.

                   Archy get him out of here.


                   I've had enough of him, I don't trust
                   myself.
                       
                   Use someone else.

      Johnny grabs the back of Lenny's chair and pushes him around
      like he's a two year old, Lenny feels a right twit. One
      Two, Handsome Bob, and Mumbles observe.


                   It's a gathering, I love a gathering
                   look, Mumbles, One Two, Handsome Bob
                   all the old faces today.
                       
                   It's all going so well apart from
                   Archy who's ruining the day. I tried
                   to cheer him up with that story about
                   how you grassed him u,...

      BANG! Lenny shoots Johnny in the hip with a gun he has kept
      hidden. Everybody is shocked, Danny jumps back in horror
      that was pretty close.


                   Whooooa,...


                   All right calm down, give me that,
                   I'll take care of him.

      Danny moves in to take the gun from Lenny.    Johnny speaks in
      pain, but still chipper.


                   That wasn't one of your better shots
                   was it now Daddy. If you want to
                   shut me up it should have been a bit
                   higher.

      Danny takes Roman, Mickey and Johnny out towards the elevator.


                You don't know how much trouble you
                have caused me so please understand
                that I will kill you very slowly if
                you do not tell me where my money
                is.


                The address is in my top pocket.
                Here, Archy,...you know I wouldn't
                mess you around.

      Lenny is out of reach of them, Archy can tell Handsome Bob
      is implying something.


                Take it Arch.

      Archy leans forward to take it,      Lenny interrupts wheeling
      himself over.


                Let me have a look first.

      He takes the letters out of Handsome Bob's top pocket and
      opens them up. He squints, the print is too small he can't
      read what it says.


                Here you can't read it without your
                glasses, let me have a look.

      Lenny looks uncomfortable, Archy almost snatches the letters
      and flicks through the pages. He reads to himself, could it
      be true? Could Lenny be the informer sending everyone around
      him down?


                What does it say?      Hurry,...



      Mickey and Roman are holding Johnny up, he's bleeding all
      over the place. Danny is facing front while another MAN is
      keeping an eye on them. We SEE, but the other's don't, Danny
      is slowly screwing on a silencer.

                A sort of, "get out of jail free"
                card, but this comes along with the
                trail of a good alibi.



      Archy turns the pages of the letter. WE SEE different JUDGES
      giving different sentences to different FACES, some of these
      faces we know, one of them is Fred the Head, Handsome Bob
      and one of them is ARCHY.

                The only evidence that will ever
                remain of this deal is that form of

                Who's this Sidney Shaw Len?


                    
                Give us that here.

                   No, I am being set up.


                   You're a dirty bastard Sidney, a
                   very dirty bastard.

      Archy grabs the belt that's used to tie up drowning victims,
      he throws it round Lenny's chair and stuffs a bit of cloth
      into Lenny's wide open mouth.


                       (to One Two, Handsome
                        Bob and Mumbles)
                   You three, cut yourself free and get
                   out of here,...

      Archy throws a knife across to Mumbles who just catches it
      and starts to cut his way out of the ropes. Archy gets back
      on with the job at hand. He reads through the names Lenny
      has grassed on over the years.


                   Michael Finny, ten years. Frazier
                   Nash, fifteen years. Cousin Ronnie,
                   six years,..you dirty bastard.
                       
                   Michael Dexter, eight years.

      Archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish
      death and bangs it on to the back of the wheel chair. He
      presses the start button and the wheelchair is raised with
      haste.


                   The Jew twins, fourteen years and of
                   course ME, Archy, four years.

      One Two, Mumbles, and Handsome Bob are free.


                   See ya Arch,....

      The three of them are out like rats up ropes, they start to
      run down the stairs.



      We pick up where we left off with this group.


                   Shouldn't have brought me here fellas,
                   you're just going to end up as
                   witnesses.

      We continue with his description of what is going to happen.

                After they have "dealt" with us,
                they're gonna put all three of us in
                the trunk of a stolen car,...



      We see six gallons of petrol in the trunk of the car in our
      imaginary scene.


                And pour six gallons of petrol on
                top, I can let your imagination fill
                in the rest.



      Back to present.


                But now Danny's rattled, he won't be
                able to wait because you now know
                what's coming, so he's gonna fire.

      Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted
      everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun.
      Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger,
      and the other MANS head is drilled through. Roman joins the
      wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's
      head. The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets
      a drilling. Silence. Johnny, who is smothered in blood,
      speaks coolly.


                Mickey, pass me the gun.

      Mickey is out to lunch, but Johnny sounds commanding.

                MICKEY quickly, pass me that gun in
                Dannys hand. Don't worry he can't
                defend himself he doesn't have a
                head, quickly now. Does this answer
                the question that you two so
                frequently asked as to why I sought
                refuge in the depths and perverse
                beauty of the crack pipe?

      The elevator door opens.






      PINK Revision   -   6-20-07                        96A.





      There stands Bandy, his gun drawn.








      WHITE Revision    -   6-6-07                                97.




                   Get fucking down!

      He looks on in horror and points the gun at Johnny. Just as
      he's about to fire,..there is a great smash of bone on timber.
      Bandy falls to reveal One Two standing there with a large
      piece of timber.


                   I think we should get out of here
                   now, don't you John?

      At which point in the background WE SEE Lenny being lowered
      to his demise. He looks at the group in horror as he is
      quickly lowered to his death by drowning and cray fish.





                   I don't like it Uri, I don't trust
                   her. I put two of my people on her
                   and they haven't come back.

      Very insulted.


                   You what? I did not tell you to do
                   this. If I had wanted her spied on
                   I would have asked for it, wouldn't



                   Yes Uri, you would have, but I still
                   don't like it.


                   I don't care what you like Victor, I
                   am in charge, now wait here.

      He gets out and walks to the door.



      She answers the door - she is surprised.


                   Can I come in?






      PINK Revision   -   6-20-07                           97A.






                Sorry to surprise you, but I have
                something for you, a token of my
                appreciation.

      He hands her a check.








      WHITE Revision    -   6-6-07                               98.




                   What is this for?


                   Please do not be insulted, you have
                   come to mean a lot to me and I value
                   you much more than just your services.
                       
                   This is simply a reflection of my
                   appreciation.
                       (vulnerable he likes
                        her)
                   I would like to ask you something
                   personal.

      His phone rings, he frowns slightly and answers it.


                   Not now Victor, I am busy.

      Uri turns. There, casually resting on the floor is his
      painting, his lucky painting. Uri's expression changes, his
      world has been shattered, he's thinking very ugly thoughts.
      He turns back to Stella, dead pan.


                   A very nice painting. How long have
                   you had it?

      A little caught off guard.


                   Years, it's my lucky painting,...
                   it's very special isn't it?


                   Beauty is a cruel mistress, is it
                   not?

      Pause, she smiles. Uri talks back into the phone, the other
      darker Uri is now in charge.


                   Victor please, come to join us.
