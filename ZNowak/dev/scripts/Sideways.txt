                                        "SIDEWAYS"

                                      Screenplay by

                               Alexander Payne &amp; Jim Taylor

                                  Based on the novel by

                                       Rex Pickett

                                       May 29, 2003





               KNOCKING at a door and distant dog BARKING.

               NOW UNDER BLACK, a CARD --



               The rapping, at first tentative and polite, grows insistent. 
               Then we hear someone get out of bed.


                         ...the fuck...

               A DOOR is opened, and the black gives way to BLINDING WHITE 
               LIGHT, the way one experiences the first glimpse of day amid, 
               say, a hangover.

               A WORKER is there.


                         Yeah?


                         Hi, Miles. Can you move your car, 
                         please?


                         Why?


                         The painters got to put the truck 
                         in, and you didn't park too good.


                              
                         Yeah, hold on.

               He closes the door with a SLAM.







               Wearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, MILES RAYMOND 
               comes out of his unit and heads toward the street. He passes 
               some SIX MEXICANS waiting to work.

               He climbs into his twelve-year-old CONVERTIBLE SAAB, parked 
               far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway. The car 
               starts fitfully.

               As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck.



               Miles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot.



               He cuts the engine, exhales a long breath and brings his 
               hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just 
               anguish. He leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and 
               soon NODS OFF.



               The door bursts open. Miles runs into the kitchen, looking 
               just past camera.


                         Fuck!



               THE MICROWAVE CLOCK that reads 10:50.



               Miles hurriedly throws clothes into a suitcase.


                         Yeah, no, I know I said I'd be there 
                         by noon, but there's been all this 
                         work going on at my building, and 
                         it's like a total nightmare, and I 
                         had a bunch of stuff to deal with 
                         this morning. But I'm on my way. I'm 
                         out the door right this second. It's 
                         going to be great. Yeah. Bye.





               Miles has a BOOK propped open on his knees. He turns a page, 
               lost in his reading.



               Miles SHOWERS.



               Miles FLOSSES.



               Miles finally makes it to the front of the line.


                         Hey, Miles.


                         Hey, Simon. Triple espresso, please.


                         Rough night, huh?
                              
                         For here?


                         No, I'm running late. Make it to go. 
                         And give me a New York Times and...
                              (scanning the display 
                              case)
                         ...a spinach croissant.



               Miles's Saab chugs up the ramp and merges.



               -- pressed against the STEERING WHEEL. The puzzle is about 
               1/3 finished.



               As though from an adjacent car, we see Miles driving while 
               carefully filling in an answer.





               A SIGN reads:





               PAN TO MILES as he signals to change lanes. The finished 
               puzzle lies on the passenger seat.



               The houses on this block are blandly palatial as in so many 
               affluent Southern California suburbs.

               Miles's car pull into the driveway behind an older BMW and 
               two LEXI. He gets out and trots toward the front door.





               In a large split-level living room displays a GOLF TOURNAMENT.



               Watching from the ultra-comfortable furniture are MIKE 
               ERGANIAN, a tanned, silver-haired real estate caudillo; bride-
               to-be CHRISTINE ERGANIAN, his oldest daughter; and JACK 
               LOPATE, wearing bowling shirt, shorts and flip-flops.

               MRS. ERGANIAN, a warm and elegant housewife, shows Miles 
               into the room.


                         Look what the cat dragged!


                         Hi, everybody.

               Mr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with 
               Miles. Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine 
               irritation.


                         About time you got here, bud. Mr. 
                         Prompt.


                         We were thinking maybe you took the 
                         wrong way and went to Tijuana and 
                         they didn't let you back in.

               The Erganians laugh. Miles works up a smile too.


                         I had to bribe them.

               More lame laughter.


                         Hey, Miles.


                              (leaning in to kiss 
                              Christine)
                         Seriously though, the freeway was 
                         unbelievable today. Unbelievable. 
                         Bumper to bumper the whole way. People 
                         getting an early start on the weekend, 
                         I guess. Granted I got a late start, 
                         but still.

               Although Mr. Erganian presses MUTE on the remote, he keeps 
               watching for an extended moment, as do Jack and Miles.


                         Christine, why don't you ask Miles 
                         about the cake?


                         Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to 
                         the kitchen with me.


                         Don't bother him with that. We got 
                         to get going.


                              
                         It'll just take a second.



               Jack and the Erganians surround Miles as he eats from a plate 
               with two pieces of CAKE -- one white, one dark.


                         Jack tells us you are publishing a 
                         book. Congratulations.


                         Yes, congratulations.

               Miles shoots Jack a look. Mr. Erganian gets some ice cubes 
               from the refrigerator door.


                         Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized 
                         yet, but, um, there has been some 
                         interest and --


                              
                         Your friend is modest.


                         Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest. 
                         Indulge them. Don't make me out to 
                         be a liar.


                         What subject is your book? Non-
                         fiction?


                         No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although 
                         there's a lot from my own life, so I 
                         guess technically some of it is non-
                         fiction.


                         Good, I like non-fiction. There is 
                         so much to know about the world that 
                         I think reading a story someone just 
                         invented is kind of a waste of time.


                         So which one do you like better?


                         I like them both, but if pressed I'd 
                         have to say I prefer the dark.


                              
                         See?





               The Erganians wave good-bye.



               Miles accelerates as he and Jack wave back.


                         Where the fuck were you, man? I was 
                         dying in there. We were supposed to 
                         be a hundred miles away by now.


                         I can't help the traffic.


                         Come on. You're fucking hungover.


                         Okay, there was a tasting last night. 
                         But I wanted to get us some stuff 
                         for the ride up. Check out the box.

               Jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a CARDBOARD 



                         Why did you tell them my book was 
                         being published?


                         You said you had it all lined up.


                         No, I didn't. What I said was that 
                         my agent had heard there was some 
                         interest at Conundrum...


                         Yeah, Conundrum.


                         ...and that one of the editors was 
                         passing it up to a senior editor. 
                         She was supposed to hear something 
                         this week, but now it's next week, 
                         and... It's always like this. It's 
                         always a fucking waiting game. I've 
                         been through it too many times 
                         already.


                         I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds 
                         like you're in to me.


                         It's a long shot, all right? And 
                         Conundrum is just a small specialty 
                         press anyway. I'm not getting my 
                         hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's 
                         it. I've stopped caring.

               Jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of CHAMPAGNE 
               and TWO GLASSES.


                         But I know it's going to happen this 
                         time. I can feel it. This is the 
                         one. I'm proud of you, man. You're 
                         the smartest guy I know.

               Jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle.


                         Don't open that now. It's warm.


                         Come on, we're celebrating. I say we 
                         pop it.


                         That's a 1992 Byron. It's really 
                         rare. Don't open it now. I've been 
                         saving it!

               Jack untwists the wire. Instantly the cork pops off, and a 
               fountain of champagne erupts.


                         For Christ's Sake, Jack! You just 
                         wasted like half of it!

               Jack begins pouring two glasses.


                         Shut up.
                              
                         Here's to a great week.


                              
                         Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass 
                         behavior, I'm really glad we're 
                         finally getting this time together.


                         Yeah.


                         You know how long I've been begging 
                         to take you on the wine tour. I was 
                         beginning to think it was never going 
                         to happen.

               They clink and drink.


                         Oh, that's tasty.


                         100% Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. 
                         They don't even make it anymore.


                         Pinot Noir? How come it's white? 
                         Doesn't noir mean dark?


                         Jesus. Don't ask questions like that 
                         up in the wine country. They'll think 
                         you're a moron.


                         Just tell me.


                         Color in the red wines comes from 
                         the skins. This juice is free run, 
                         so there's no skin contact in the 
                         fermentation, ergo no color.


                              
                         Sure is tasty.



               The Saab heads north.



               The boys continue to drink and drive.


                         Did you read the latest draft, by 
                         the way?


                         Oh, yeah. Yeah.


                         And?


                         I liked it a lot. A lot of 
                         improvements. It just seemed overall, 
                         I don't know, tighter, more... 
                         congealed or something.


                         How about the new ending? Did you 
                         like that?


                         Oh yeah. Much better.


                         There is no new ending. Page 750 on 
                         is exactly the same.


                         Well, then I guess it must have felt 
                         new because everything leading up to 
                         it was so different.



               Miles is pumping gas. Jack is stretching his legs nearby or 
               perhaps cleaning the windshield.

               A CELLPHONE RINGS. Jack reaches into his pocket.


                              
                         It's Christine.
                              
                         Hey you.


                         You guys having fun?

               Christine's voice is so loud that Jack has to hold the phone 
               away from his ear.


                         Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have 
                         been a blast.


                         Good. That's good.

               A silence, then --


                         So what's up?


                         Just seeing how you're doing. And, 
                         um, Mom and I were starting to look 
                         over the seating charts again, and 
                         we're wondering if you wanted Tony 
                         Levin to sit next to the Feldmans, 
                         or should he be at one of the singles 
                         tables?

               Jack looks at Miles in a mute appeal for sympathy.


                         So what do you think? With the 
                         Feldmans?

               Jack hasn't even really heard the question.


                         Yeah. The Feldmans.

               As the conversation continues, Miles replaces the GAS PUMP, 
               screws the GAS CAP back on, and together the guys get back 
               into the car. We DRIVE AWAY WITH THEM.


                         Really? Because I don't know, I was 
                         thinking that --


                         Well, then put him at the singles 
                         table.


                         The problem with that is that then 
                         there's one extra --


                         Then put him with the Feldmans. 
                         Whatever you and your Mom decide is 
                         fine with me.


                         Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to 
                         include you in this decision. He's 
                         your friend.


                         I didn't dismiss you. I told you 
                         what I thought, but it didn't seem 
                         to matter, so you decide. Besides, 
                         this is supposed to be my time with 
                         Miles. I hope you're not going to 
                         call every five minutes.


                         I'm not going to call every five 
                         minutes, but this is important.


                         Honey, I'm just saying you know I 
                         need a little space before the 
                         wedding. Isn't that the point of 
                         this? Isn't that what we talked about 
                         with Dr. Gertler?

               A silence. Then --


                         Why are you being so defensive?


                         I don't know, Christine. Perhaps 
                         it's because I feel attacked.


                         I ask you one simple question, and 
                         suddenly I'm attacking you.


                         Listen. I'll call you when we get 
                         there, and we can talk about it then, 
                         okay?


                         Bye.


                         I love you.


                         Bye.

               Jack SLAMS his cellphone shut, momentarily blinded with rage.


                         Tony Levin? Why did you fucking invite 
                         Tony Levin?



               The Saab heads north -- now passing through LOS ANGELES.



               Miles signals and begins to head for an EXIT.


                         Whoa, why are we getting off?


                         I've just got to make one quick stop. 
                         Won't take a second.  


                         What?


                         I thought we could just say a quick 
                         hello to my mother.


                         Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were 
                         supposed to be up there hours ago.


                         It's her birthday tomorrow. And I 
                         don't feel right driving by her house 
                         and not stopping in, okay? It'll 
                         just take a second. She's right off 
                         the freeway.



               The Saab takes an EXIT.


                         How old's she going to be?


                         Um... seventy... something.


                         That's a good age.







               The Saab rounds a corner and parks in front of a modest CONDO.







               Approaching the front door, Miles pulls a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS 
               out of a plastic grocery store bag. Jack carries a bottle of 


               Miles pulls a BIRTHDAY CARD out of the bag too.


                         Wait a second.

               He pulls a PEN from his pocket and signs it. As he licks the 
               envelope, Jack rings the bell.

               Moments later PHYLLIS comes to the door. She is a matronly 
               older woman in a nightgown and housecoat.


                         Surprise! Happy Birthday!

               The boys offer up the flowers and champagne. Phyllis slurs 
               slightly as she speaks -- she's been doing some celebrating 
               of her own.


                         My God. Miles. And Jack! What a 
                         surprise. I can't remember the last 
                         time you brought me flowers.

               They hug.


                         They're from both of us.


                         A famous actor bringing me flowers 
                         on my birthday. Don't I feel special?


                         A famous actor who's getting married 
                         next week.


                         Oh, that's right. Isn't that nice? I 
                         hope that girls knows how lucky she 
                         is, marrying no less than Derek 
                         Summersby.

               The boys follow her inside.




                         Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven 
                         years ago.


                         Well, you were wonderful on that 
                         show. I never understood why they 
                         had to give you that brain tumor so 
                         soon. Why that didn't make you the 
                         biggest movie star in the world is a 
                         sin. It's a sin.


                         Yeah, well, you should be my agent.


                         If I was, I would sing your praises 
                         up and down the street until they 
                         put me in the loony bin. Now Miles, 
                         why didn't you tell me you were coming 
                         and bringing this handsome man? Look 
                         how I'm dressed. I've got to run and 
                         put my face on.  


                         You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.


                              
                         Oh, stop it. Make yourselves 
                         comfortable.
                              
                         You boys hungry?


                         Yeah, I'm hungry.

               Jack gives Miles a look.


                              
                         Just a snack. Calm down.

               Miles leads Jack into this small condo. The TV is on, and 
               it's MESSY. Amid the newspapers and junk mail and dishes, an 
               AB-ROLLER and an ancient SCHWINN EXER-CYCLE sit forgotten in 
               a corner.



               Miles finishes twisting ice trays into a MOP BUCKET as it 
               fills with water in the sink. He puts the champagne in and 
               carries it into the --



               He takes a seat on the sofa next to Jack, who is watching 



                         Let me show you something. The secret 
                         to opening champagne is that once 
                         the cork is released, you keep 
                         pressure on it so you don't --


                              (concentrated on the 

                         Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.

               Miles finishes opening the bottle with an elegant silence.


                         Ready for my close up!

               The boys turn to see Phyllis now dolled up in thick make-up 
               and a PANTSUIT. Her eyebrows are painted and cock-eyed. 
               Overall she looks much worse than before.


                         Oh, champagne! Miles, why don't you 
                         bring that out onto the lanai? I 
                         thought we could eat on the lanai.



               Miles and Jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular 
               glass table. They are mid-meal.

               Everyone is more than a little lubricated, especially the 
               birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another 
               plate of food.


                         Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. 
                         Absolutely delicious.


                              
                         They're just leftovers.


                         Is it chicken?


                         I could have made something fancier 
                         if a certain someone had let me know 
                         that a certain someone was coming 
                         for a visit with a certain special 
                         friend. Could have made a pork roast.


                         It was a surprise, Mom.


                         And I could have already put clean 
                         sheets on the other bed and the fold-
                         out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and 
                         the twins are picking us up at 11:30 
                         to go to brunch at the Sheraton. 
                         They do a magnificent job there. 
                         Wendy is so excited you're coming.

               Silence. Jack freezes, his fork halfway to his mouth.


                         You talked to Wendy?


                         Just now. She's thrilled. And the 
                         kids.


                              
                         Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty 
                         eager to get up to... you know, but, 
                         uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.


                         Well, you boys do what you want. I 
                         just think it would be nice for us 
                         to be together as a family on my 
                         birthday.


                         Uh-huh.
                              
                         I'll be right back.

               He gets up and heads into the house.



               Miles heads toward...



               ...and goes directly to her dresser, opening a drawer filled 
               with bras, panties and stockings.

               He burrows through his mother's lingerie until locating a 
               CAN OF RAID. A can of Raid?

               He twists open the bottom and pulls it apart, revealing it 
               to be a SECRET STASH for valuables disguised as a common 
               household product. Inside are stacks of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR 



                              (quickly peeling some 
                              off)
                         ...six, seven, eight,...
                              (one more for good 
                              luck)
                         Nine.

               His task complete, he closes the drawer, and as he stuffs 
               the bills in his pocket, his glance falls upon FRAMED PHOTOS 
               atop the dresser --

               -- A proud NINE-YEAR-OLD MILES poses in front of his childhood 
               San Diego home, showing off a WAGON filled with freshly 
               harvested lettuce. On the wagon is a hand-lettered sign --
               "10 cents a bunch."

               -- A Sears portrait shows the RAYMOND FAMILY: a much younger 
               Phyllis, her husband, and their two children -- a 12-year-
               old Miles and seven-year-old Wendy.

               -- Miles at his wedding. He and his bride VICTORIA look young 
               and attractive, their faces radiant and hopeful.



               Miles enters, flushes the toilet and leaves.



               As Miles slides open the door and takes his seat again, Jack 
               is pouring Phyllis another glass.


                         And what was that other one you did, 
                         the one where you're the jogger?


                         Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That 
                         was for Spray and Wash.


                         Spray and Wash. That's the one.


                         Yeah, I remember the girl who was in 
                         it with me. She was something.


                         I just remember you jogging. So when's 
                         the wedding?


                              
                         This Saturday, Mom, remember? We 
                         told you.


                         And Miles is my best man, Mrs. 
                         Raymond. My main man.


                              (another drink of 
                              wine)
                         Miles, when are you going to get 
                         married again?


                         I just got divorced. Phyllis.


                         Two years ago, buddy.


                         You should get back together with 
                         Victoria. She was good for you.

               Embarrassed for his friend, Jack just stares at his food.


                         She was good for you.
                              
                         And so beautiful and intelligent. 
                         You knew her, right?


                         Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.


                         I'm worried about you, Miles. Do you 
                         need some money?


                         I'm fine.

               Miles takes another drink of wine.



               UNDER BLACK, a CARD --




                         Jack. Jack.



               Jack finally awakens with a start and finds Miles standing 
               above him, shaking him.



               As Jack gets up, we see he has crashed on Phyllis's bed 
               adorned with all her decorative PILLOWS.



               Still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies 
               sprawled and snoring on the sofa. On the TV, ostensibly never 
               turned off the night before, is an inane CARTOON.

               As Miles opens the front door, he spots Jack heading toward 
               the TV to turn it off. Miles waves him off.


                              
                         She'll wake up.

               As they leave and Miles closes the front door quietly behind 
               him, we PAN to the flowers still wrapped and forgotten on a 
               side table.



               TWO PLATES OF FOOD float in front of two breasts tucked inside 
               a zippered uniform.



               Disheveled and unshaven, Jack and Miles are served breakfast 
               by a young, innocently sexy WAITRESS. Jack leers after her.


                         Fuck, man. Too early in the morning 
                         for that, you know what I mean?


                         She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look 
                         at that stuff anymore.


                         That's your problem, Miles.


                         As if she'd even be attracted to 
                         guys like us in the first place.


                         Speak for yourself. I get chicks 
                         looking at me all the time. All ages.


                         It's not worth it. You pay too big a 
                         price. It's never free.

               They eat in silence a moment.


                         You need to get laid.

               Miles shrugs off the comment.


                         It'd be the best thing for you. You 
                         know what? I'm going to get you laid 
                         this week. That's going to be my 
                         best man gift to you. I'm not going 
                         to give you a pen knife or a gift 
                         certificate or any of that other 
                         horseshit.


                         I'd rather have a knife.


                         No. No. You've been officially 
                         depressed for like two years now, 
                         and you were always a negative guy 
                         anyway, even in college. Now it's 
                         worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching 
                         English to fucking eighth-graders 
                         when they should be reading what you 
                         wrote. Your books.


                         I'm working on it.

               Miles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns


                         You still seeing that shrink?


                         I went on Monday. But I spent most 
                         of the time helping him with his 
                         computer.


                         Well, I say fuck therapy and what's 
                         that stuff you take, Xanax?


                         And Lexapro, yes.


                         Well, I say fuck that. You need to 
                         get your joint worked on, that's 
                         what you need.


                         Jack. This week is not about me. 
                         It's about you. I'm going to show 
                         you a good time. We're going to drink 
                         a lot of good wine, play some golf, 
                         eat some great food, enjoy the scenery 
                         and send you off in style.


                         And get your bone smooched.

               Jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions 
               for more coffee. She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be 
               right over. Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to 
               signal he'll wait. Jack turns back to see Miles watching 
               him.


                         What?



               In a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN --
               makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that 
               those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize.

               MUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the 
               rhythm of a road trip.



               The car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward 
               Buellton. Miles and Jack must SHOUT to be heard in the open 
               car.


                         You know what? Let's take the Santa 
                         Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.


                         Whatever's closest, man. I need a 
                         glass.


                         These guys make top-notch Pinot and 
                         Chardonnay. One of the best producers 
                         in Santa Barbara county.
                              
                         Look how beautiful this view is. 
                         What a day!


                         I thought you hated Chardonnay.


                         I like all varietals. I just don't 
                         generally like the way they manipulate 
                         Chardonnay in California -- too much 
                         oak and secondary malolactic 
                         fermentation.



               The Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto SANTA ROSA road.



               The boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines.


                         Jesus, what a day! Isn't it gorgeous? 
                         And the ocean's just right over that 
                         ridge. See, the reason this region's 
                         great for Pinot is that the cold air 
                         off the Pacific flows in at night 
                         through these transverse valleys and 
                         cools down the berries. Pinot's a 
                         very thin-skinned grape and doesn't 
                         like heat or humidity.

               Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and 
               articulateness.

               The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long 
               gravel DRIVEWAY.


                         Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel 
                         sells.


                         Thanks, Jack. So do I.
                              
                         Here we are.



               Miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. As they 
               get out and walk --


                         So what'd you guys finally decide on 
                         for the menu?


                         I told you. Filet and salmon.


                         Yeah, but how are they making the 
                         salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill 
                         sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?


                         I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always 
                         have white wine with fish?


                         Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we 
                         have to find out because it's going 
                         to make a big difference.


                              
                         Let me call Christine.


                         Doesn't have to be now. Let's go 
                         taste.


                         I owe her a call anyway.

               Miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room 
               as Jack SPEED DIALS.


                         Hey, honey. So we're up here about 
                         to taste some whites, and we need to 
                         know how the caterers are going to 
                         make the salmon.

               Jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.


                         No, I know, I didn't forget, but we 
                         wound up at Miles's mom's house, and 
                         it got really late, and it was hard 
                         to call, so I'm calling you now. I 
                         said I was sorry. Yes, I did.
                              
                         You heard me say I was sorry, right?

               Miles just shrugs.


                         Miles heard me say I was sorry.

               As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he 
               wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of 
               earshot.


                         Give me a break, will you? I just 
                         called to find out about the salmon -- 
                         for our wedding -- to be more 
                         involved, like you said -- and all 
                         you want to do is get into it about 
                         last night and, okay, I'm sorry. I'm 
                         sorry I didn't call. You're totally 
                         right. I know, but I'm trying to 
                         make this the best wedding I can 
                         with the best wine we can find. Don't 
                         I get any credit for that? Okay. 
                         Look, I've got to go. I'm out here 
                         in the parking lot, and Miles is 
                         waiting for me...

               And so it goes, Jack's voice rising and falling. Miles decides 
               to head inside.



               Miles is at the bar, TWO GLASSES in front of him. Jack walks 
               in and bellies up next to him.


                              
                         Baked with a butter-lime glaze.


                         Now we're talking.

               CHRIS BURROUGHS, a POURER in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes 
               over.


                         This is the condemned man?


                         Here he is. Jack, Chris. Chris, Jack.

               Chris and Jack shake hands.


                         How you doing?


                         You guys want to start with the Vin 
                         Gris?


                         Sounds good.

               TWO GLASSES are filled with small amounts of PINOT NOIR VIN 



                         This is rose, right?


                         Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this 
                         one is rather atypically made from 
                         100% Pinot Noir.


                         Pinot noir? Not again!
                              
                         You know, not all Pinots are noir.

               They laugh.

               Miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then 
               lifts it to smell. Jack clumsily imitates Miles, perhaps 
               even spilling some wine in the process.


                         Let me show you.

               We see details of what Miles now describes.


                         First take your glass and examine 
                         the wine against the light. You're 
                         looking at color and clarity.


                         What color is it supposed to be?


                         Depends on the varietal. Just get a 
                         sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? 
                         Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...


                         Huh.


                         Now tip it. What you're doing here 
                         is checking for color density as it 
                         thins toward the rim. Tells you how 
                         old it is, among other things, usually 
                         more important with reds. This is a 
                         very young wine, so it's going to 
                         retain its color pretty solidly. Now 
                         stick your nose in it.

               Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume 
               bottle.


                         Don't be shy. Get your nose in there.

               Jack now buries his nose in the glass.


                         What do you smell?


                         I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?

               Miles smells.


                         There's not much there yet, but you 
                         can still find...
                              
                         ...a little citrus... maybe some 
                         strawberry... passion fruit... and 
                         there's even a hint of like 
                         asparagus... or like a nutty Edam 
                         cheese.

               Jack smells again and begins to brighten.


                         Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, 
                         strawberry. I'm not so sure about 
                         the cheese.


                         Now set your glass down and get some 
                         air into it.

               Miles expertly swirls the wine. Jack follows suit.


                         Oxygenating it opens it up, unlocks 
                         the aroma and the flavors. Very 
                         important. Now we smell again.

               They do so. Jack smiles.


                         That's what you do with every one.


                         When do we get to drink it?


                         Now.

               Jack gulps his wine down in one shot. Miles chews his before 
               swallowing.


                         How would you rate this one?


                         Usually they start you on the wines 
                         with learning disabilities, but this 
                         one's pretty damn good.
                              
                         This is the new one, right, Chris?


                         Released it about two months ago.


                         Nice job.


                         We like it.


                              
                         You know, you could work in a wine 
                         store.


                         Yeah, that would be a good move.

               Now Miles notices something about Jack.


                         Are you chewing gum?


                         Want some?



               The Saab passes through this Danish-themed tourist town. 







               The Saab makes its way into this very average-looking Central 
               coast town right off the freeway.







               The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel. And look --
               there's the WINDMILL itself, its decorative blades motionless.  



               Miles and Jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto 
               their respective beds.



               The sounds of a SHOWER and OFF-KEY SINGING come from the 
               bathroom while Miles sits impatiently on the bed. He pounds 
               on the wall.


                         Hey Jack, hurry up!


                         Just a minute!

               Opening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a GIDEON'S BIBLE and 
               tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine.



               Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble 
               along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway. They 
               pass a mall and a car dealership.


                         I thought you said it was close. Now 
                         I'm all pitted out.


                         It's not even a mile.


                         We should have driven.


                         Not with the wine list these people 
                         have. We don't want to hold back.


                         You think I'm making a mistake 
                         marrying Christine?


                         Whoa.


                         Come on, do you think I'm doing the 
                         right thing? Tell the truth. You've 
                         been through it.


                         Well, you waited for good reason, 
                         and you proposed to Christine for 
                         some good reason. So I think it's 
                         great. It's time. You've got to have 
                         your eyes open, that's all. I mean, 
                         look at me. I thought Victoria and I 
                         were set for life.


                         Christine's dad -- he's been talking 
                         about bringing me into his property 
                         business. Showing me the ropes. And 
                         that's something, considering how 
                         long it took him to get over I'm not 
                         Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. 
                         But I don't know, might get a little 
                         incestuous. But Mike does pretty 
                         well. A lot of high-end commercial 
                         stuff.


                         So you're going to stop acting?


                         No way. This would just provide some 
                         stability is what I'm saying. I can 
                         always squeeze in an audition or a 
                         commercial here and there, you know, 
                         keep myself in the game in case 
                         something big comes along.


                         Uh-huh.


                         We're not getting any younger, right? 
                         And my career, well, it's gotten 
                         pretty, you know, frustrating. Even 
                         with my new manager. Maybe it's time 
                         to settle down.


                         If that's what feels right.


                              
                         It does. Feels right.


                         Then it's a good thing.


                              (nodding, feeling 
                              better)
                         Yeah. It's good. Feels good.

               Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking 
               lot. The camera PANS to reveal --

               THE HITCHING POST, a local institution.



               Miles and Jack belly up. GARY, the Samoan bartender, spots 
               Miles and extends a welcoming hand.


                         Hey, Miles. Long time no see.


                         Gary.


                         When's that novel of yours coming 
                         out?  We  all want to read it.


                         Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy 
                         Jack. He's getting married next week.


                              
                         My condolences.


                         What are you pouring tonight?


                         Lot of good stuff.
                              (looking at a row of 
                              bottles)
                         Got the new Bien Nacido. Want a taste?


                         Absolutement.
                              
                         They have their own label that's 
                         just outstanding.

               Gary pours Jack and Miles a generous sample and the two men 
               swirl, sniff and taste. Jack is beginning to get the hang of 
               things.


                         What do you think?


                         Tight as a nun's asshole but qood 
                         concentration. Nice fruit.


                         Yeah. Tight.


                              
                         Pour us a couple.

               Gary fills their glasses and corks the bottle. Jack raises 
               his glass to toast.


                         Here's to my last week of freedom.


                         It's going to be great. Here's to 
                         us.

               They clink their glasses and take a drink. We linger on them 
               as Miles retreats inward and a restless Jack scans the room.



               Jack and Miles review their menus. Jack looks up and spots a 
               PRETTY WAITRESS placing an order at the bar.


                         Miles. Check it out.

               Miles glances at the waitress and returns to his menu.


                         Oh, yeah. That's Maya.


                         You know her?


                         Sure I know Maya.


                         You know that chick?


                         Jack, this is where I eat when I 
                         come up here. It's practically my 
                         office. And sometimes I have a drink 
                         with the employees. Maya's great. 
                         She's worked here about a year, maybe 
                         a year and a half.


                         She is very hot.


                         And very nice. And very married. 
                         Check out the rock.

               Jack leans forward and squints.


                         Doesn't mean shit. When Christine 
                         was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she 
                         wore a big engagement ring to keep 
                         guys from hitting on her. Think it 
                         worked? Fuck no. How do you think I 
                         met her?


                         This gal's married to I think a 
                         Philosophy professor at UC Santa 
                         Barbara.


                         So what's a professor's wife doing 
                         waitressing? Obviously that's over.


                         You don't know anything about this 
                         woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, 
                         okay?
                              
                         The duck is excellent and pairs nicely 
                         with the Highliner Pinot.

               Just then Maya comes by carrying a tray of food on her way 
               to another table.


                         Hey, Miles. Good to see you.


                         Maya, how are you?


                         I'm doing good, good. You look great. 
                         Did you lose some weight?


                         Oh, no, actually. Busy night.


                         Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been 
                         out tasting today?


                         You know it. This is my friend Jack. 
                         Jack, Maya.


                              
                         Hiya.


                              
                         Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. 
                         Bye, Miles.

               She goes.


                         Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes 
                         you. What else do you know about 
                         her?


                         Well, she does know a lot about wine.


                         Ooooooohh. Now we're getting 
                         somewhere.


                         And she likes Pinot.


                         Perfect.


                         Jack, she's a fucking waitress in 
                         Buellton. How would that ever work?


                         Why do you always focus on the 
                         negative? Didn't you see how friendly 
                         she was to you?


                         She works for tips!


                         You're blind, dude. Blind.

               Miles focuses again on the menu.


                         I also recommend the ostrich. Very 
                         lean. Locally raised.





               are refilled with the contents of yet another bottle of 
               Hitching Post Pinot Noir.

               Jack and Miles are enjoying a post-prandial drink.



               Looks like he's thinking about something. Then --


                         I hate Tony Levin.

               Jack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp. Just then --



               Walks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down. She 
               has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys, 
               lovely but tired.


                              
                         Highliner, please.


                         That's on us.

               Maya looks over and smiles as Gary pours her a glass from 
               their bottle.


                         Hey, guys.

               Maya gets an American Spirit Yellow out of her purse and 
               lights it while Gary pours her a glass.


                         You want to join us?


                              
                         Sure.

               In no hurry, she takes a long sip of her wine, gets up and 
               comes down the bar.


                         So how's that book of yours going, 
                         Miles? I think you were almost done 
                         with it last time we talked.


                         I finished it.


                         Good for you.


                         It's getting published. That's what 
                         we're up here celebrating.

               Miles shoots Jack a look. Jack responds with a "don't-fuck- 
               it-up-brother" glower.


                         That's fantastic. Congratulations.

               She offers her glass, and all clink.


                              
                         Are you a writer too?


                         No, I'm an actor.


                         Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?


                         A lot of TV. I was a regular on a 
                         couple of series. And lately I've 
                         been doing a lot of commercials. 
                         National mostly.


                         Anything I'd know?


                         Maybe. Recognize this?

               Jack takes a deep breath, and out comes a perfect VOICE-OVER 



                         "Now with low, low 5.8% APR 
                         financing."

               Maya's mouth drops open and curves into a big smile.


                         That's hilarious. You sound just 
                         like one of those guys.


                         I am one of those guys.


                         You are not.


                         He is.

               Jack launches into another one of his sure-fire hits.


                              
                         Consult your doctor before using 
                         this product. Side effects may include 
                         oily discharge, dizziness, hives, 
                         loss of appetite, difficulty breathing 
                         and low blood pressure. If you have 
                         diabetes or a history of kidney 
                         trouble... you're fucked!

               This makes Maya laugh a big throaty laugh. Jack joins in. 
               Nervous about Jack's aggressive flirtatiousness, Miles musters 
               a tight courtesy smile.


                              
                         Oh. I needed that. Thank you.

               They all take a drink of wine.


                         So what are you guys up to tonight?

               Before Jack has a chance to speak --


                         We're pretty wiped. Probably go back 
                         to the hotel and crash.

               This makes Maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent 
               availability, but she recovers quickly, remains breezy.


                         Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a 
                         long drive up here. Where're you 
                         staying?


                         The Windmill.


                         Windmill.

               Maya downs the rest of her wine, stamps out her smoke, and 
               picks up her jean jacket and purse.


                         Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.


                         See you.

               As she leaves --


                         We'll catch up with you later, okay?

               But she's gone. Jack gives Miles a slow burn look.


                         We'll probably go back to the hotel 
                         and crash?



               The guys walk drunkenly along the shoulder as CARS WHIZ BY.


                         The girl is looking to party, and 
                         you tell her we're going to go back 
                         to our motel room and crash? Jesus, 
                         Miles!


                         Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?


                         The chick digs you. She lit up like 
                         a pinball machine when she heard 
                         your novel was getting published.


                         Now I've got another lie to live 
                         down. Thanks, Jack.


                         I'm trying to get you some action, 
                         but you've got to help me out just a 
                         little bit.


                         Didn't seem to me like that's what 
                         was going on. You were all over her.


                         Somebody had to do the talking. And 
                         by the way, I was right. She's not 
                         married.


                         How do you know?


                         No rock. When she came to the bar, 
                         sans rock.



               The screen is absolutely BLACK.


                         Single. Waitress. Getting off work. 
                         Looking for love. A little slap and 
                         tickle.


                         Shut up.


                         She probably went home, lit some 
                         candles, put on some relaxing music, 
                         took a nice hot bath, and laid down 
                         on her bed with her favorite vibrator.

               Jack begins to make a soft BUZZING noise, growing gradually 
               louder and more rhythmic.


                         Have you no shame?


                         Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.


                         Fuck you.

               There's now a rustling noise and footsteps. Then a LIGHT is 
               flipped on in the BATHROOM.

               Miles closes the door behind him, and the only light visible 
               is at the bottom of the bathroom door.

               Miles PEES -- a series of semi-forced SHORT SQUIRTS. Then a 
               FLUSH as a door opens and the light goes off. Jack starts 
               BUZZING again.


                         Shut the fuck up!

               Jack stops and Miles climbs into bed. Silence. Then --


                         You need to get your prostate checked.







               Establishing.



               Miles and Jack are glancing at the menus. For some reason 
               Jack is humorless and grumpy.


                         So what're we going to have? Pigs in 
                         a blanket? The "rancher's special 
                         breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease 
                         and fat with a side of lard?


                              
                         So what's the plan today?


                         We head north, begin the grape tour 
                         up there, make our way south so the 
                         more we drink the closer we get to 
                         the motel.

               Jack sarcastically taps an index finger to his temple.


                         What's your problem?

               Jack exhales and looks away, as though he doesn't want to 
               get into it.


                         What is it?

               Jack sucks his teeth a moment searching for the right words. 
               Then the dam bursts.


                         I am going to get my nut on this 
                         trip, Miles. And you are not going 
                         to fuck it up for me with all your 
                         depression and anxiety and neg-head 
                         downer shit.


                         Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.


                         Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do 
                         not fuck with me. I am going to get 
                         laid before I settle down on Saturday. 
                         Do you read me?


                         Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. 
                         It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in 
                         the way and dragging you down. Maybe 
                         you'd have a better time on your 
                         own. You take the car. I'll catch 
                         the train back.


                         No, see, I want both of us to get 
                         crazy. We should both be cutting 
                         loose. I mean, this is our last 
                         chance. This is our week! It should 
                         be something we share.

               The older WAITRESS comes over.


                         Can I take your order?


                         But I am warning you.


                         Oatmeal, one poached egg, and rye 
                         toast. Dry.


                         Okay. And you?


                              
                         Pigs in a blanket. With extra syrup.



               The Saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through 
               large open vineyards.





               A MAP and a MOVING LINE show the boys' route.





               GRAPES growing on the vine.





               Framed by foreground grapevines, the Saab passes in the 
               distance.





               Miles has just downed a taste of red wine.


                         How much skin and stem contact?


                         About four weeks.


                         Huh. That explains all the tannins. 
                         And how long in oak?


                         About a year.


                         French or American?


                         Both.


                         Good stuff.


                         Yeah, oak. That's a good wood.

               Just as the pourer turns away toward other TASTERS, Jack 
               GRABS the bottle and helps himself and Miles to another glass. 
               They slam back their drinks like tequila.





               Miles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out. Before 
               them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards.


                         Nice, huh?


                         Beautiful.


                         Victoria and I used to like this 
                         view.
                              
                         Once we had a picnic here and drank 
                         a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon 
                         and artichokes, but we didn't care.


                         Miles.


                         She has the best palate of any woman 
                         I've ever known. She could even 
                         differentiate Italian wines.


                         Miles, I gotta tell you something. 
                         Victoria's coming to the wedding.


                         I know. You told me. I'm okay with 
                         it.


                         Yeah, but that's not the whole story. 
                         She got remarried.


                         She what?
                              
                         When?


                         About a month ago. Six weeks.


                         To that guy? That guy with the 
                         restaurant...

               Jack nods. Miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long 
               breath. Then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes 
               the door.


                         Miles... MILES...

               Miles continues to stare straight ahead.


                              
                         Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!


                         I want to go home now.


                         You've been divorced for two years 
                         already. People move on. She has! 
                         It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes 
                         you feel special or something.


                         Is she bringing him to the wedding?


                         What do you think?


                         You drop this bombshell on me. Why 
                         didn't you tell me before?


                         Because I knew you'd freak out and 
                         probably get so depressed you wouldn't 
                         even come on this trip. But then I 
                         figured here would be the best place 
                         to tell you. We're here to forget 
                         about all that shit. We're here to 
                         party!


                              
                         I'm going to be a fucking pariah. 
                         Everyone's just going to be holding 
                         their breath to see if I'm going to 
                         get drunk and make a scene. Plus 
                         Tony fucking Levin?


                         No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to 
                         Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's 
                         cool.


                              
                         You've all been talking about it? 
                         Behind my back? Talking about it?

               Miles turns and locates an open BOTTLE of wine in the back 
               seat. He uncorks it and begins to swig.


                         Hey, hey, hey. No, you don't!

               Jack tries unsuccessfully to grab the bottle from Miles, but 
               Miles bolts out of the car.



               Pursued by Jack, Miles dashes down the hill, all the while 
               taking huge swigs from the bottle.





               Miles slows to walk between rows of GRAPEVINES. He polishes 
               off the bottle and tosses it. A painting Jack catches up 
               with him in the adjacent grapevine corridor.

               Miles's face crumbles as though he were about to cry. Then 
               he collapses to the ground and closes his eyes tight.

               Jack looks around impatiently for a moment. Then he squats 
               down so he can see Miles underneath the vines.


                         Miles?

               Miles ignores Jack and focuses on the beautiful RIPE GRAPES 
               that surround him. They seem to distract him from his pain.


                         You going to be okay?

               Miles looks up and shakes his head a definitive NO. Jack 
               can't help but LAUGH.





               The sun hangs low as the Saab pulls into the parking lot, 
               Jack at the wheel.



               The pourer, a brunette in her early thirties, breaks away 
               from a BORING COUPLE down the bar. This is STEPHANIE.


                         Hey, guys. How's it going?


                         Excellent. My friend and I are up 
                         here doing the wine tour, and he 
                         tells me that you folks make one 
                         hell of a Syrah.


                         That's what people say.


                              
                         You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he 
                         didn't know Pinot Noir from film 
                         noir.


                         I'm a quick learner.

               Stephanie laughs. She apparently likes big good-natured lunks 
               like Jack.


                         I'm trying to teach my friend here 
                         some basics about wine over the next 
                         few days before he goes off and --

               WHOOMP! Under the bar Jack stomps on Miles's foot. Miles 
               winces.

               Stephanie slides TWO GLASSES in front of them.


                         That's right -- I'm here to learn. I 
                         never had that much interest in wine 
                         before, but this trip has been very 
                         enlightening. Always like wine, of 
                         course, but I don't know. More of a 
                         beer man, really. Microbreweries.

               She THUMPS the cork off a bottle of Chardonnay.


                         Well, no better way to learn than 
                         tasting.

               She pours almost flirtatious amounts.


                         Now there's a girl who knows how to 
                         pour. What's your name?


                         Stephanie.


                         Nice.

               Jack swirls the wine as though he were by now a sommelier. 
               They look, they smell, they taste.


                         So what do you think?


                         Quaffable but far from transcendent.


                         I like it. Tastes great. Oaky.

               Stephanie reaches for another bottle and pours. Jack's eyes 
               never leave her.


                         Cabernet Franc.
                              
                         This is only the fifth year we've 
                         made this varietal. Very few wineries 
                         around here do a straight Cabernet 
                         Franc. It's from our vineyard up in 
                         Santa Maria. And it was a Silver 
                         Medal winner at Paso Robles last 
                         year.


                         Well, I've come to never expect 
                         greatness from a Cab Franc, and this 
                         one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, 
                         overripe --


                              
                         Tastes good to me. You live around 
                         here, Stephanie?


                         In Santa Ynez.
                              
                         And I agree with you about Cab Franc.


                         Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. 
                         Windmill Inn.


                         Oh yeah.


                         You know a gal named Maya? Works at 
                         the Hitching Post?


                         Sure I know Maya. Real well.


                         No shit. We just had a drink with 
                         her last night. Miles knows her.


                         Could we move on to the Syrah, please?

               As she turns to reach for the right bottle, Jack winks at 
               Miles. Miles shakes his head.


                         This is our Estate Syrah...

               She pours each of them a full HALF GLASS.


                         You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.


                         I know. I might need to be spanked.

               She notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has 
               been monopolized.


                         Excuse me.

               As she wanders down the bar, Jack turns to Miles, his mouth 
               wide open.


                         A bad girl, Miles. She might need to 
                         be spanked.


                         Do you know how often these pourers 
                         get hit on?

               They glance down the bar at Stepanie. She smiles back.



               Miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes. He 
               looks over and sees Jack waddling over from the tasting room 
               with TWO CASES OF WINE.


                         Get the trunk.


                         You have the keys.

               Jack puts the cases down and glances back at the building.


                         We're on.


                         What?


                         She called Maya, who's not working 
                         tonight, so we're all going out.


                         With Maya?


                         Been divorced for a year now, bud.

               Jack puts the wine in the trunk, and they get in the car.


                         Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it 
                         all going on.


                         Well, she is cute.


                         Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And 
                         you almost tell her I'm getting 
                         married. What's the matter with you?
                              (drumming on the 
                              steering wheel)
                         Gotta love it. Gotta love it.





               GOLF on ESPN.



               sit transfixed, each on his own bed. The curtains are drawn. 
               Then out of nowhere --


                              
                         You know how often these pourers get 
                         hit on?
                              
                         I'm going for a swim. Get the blood 
                         flowing. Want to come?


                         Nah. I want to watch this.



               A guy gets ready to putt. The announcer whispers what an 
               important moment this is. The guy misses.





               The sound of an AEROSOL CAN.


                         Miles. Hey, Miles. Time to get up.



               Jack spraying his feet with some Dr. Scholl's product.



               Miles pulls himself out of bed and slouches toward his 
               suitcase.


                         Fucking chick in the Jacuzzi --
                         goddamn, Miles, fucking going nuts 
                         up here. Whole place is wide open. 
                         Assylvania.

               Jack does some actor's weird warm-up stretch.


                         So what should I wear?


                         I don't know. Casual but nice. They 
                         think you're a writer.

               As Miles begins to dig through his suitcase, Jack flips open 
               his cellphone and speed-dials.


                         Don't you have any other shoes?

               Miles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor.


                              
                         Hello? Oh hey, baby, just checking 
                         in. Not much. We're about to go out 
                         for dinner, probably be out pretty 
                         late, so I thought I'd say goodnight 
                         now. I know, I love you too. I miss 
                         you.



               The boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk 
               in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet 
               restaurants.


                         Please just try to be your normal 
                         humorous self, okay? Like who you 
                         were before the tailspin. Do you 
                         remember that guy? People love that 
                         guy. And don't forget -- your novel 
                         is coming out in the fall.


                         Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it 
                         called?


                         Do not sabotage me. If you want to 
                         be a lightweight, that's your call. 
                         But do not sabotage me.


                         Aye-aye, captain.


                         And if they want to drink Merlot, 
                         we're drinking Merlot.


                              
                         If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. 
                         I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!


                         Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No 
                         Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?

               Miles takes a SMALL BOTTLE from his pocket and rattles it.


                         And don't drink too much. I don't 
                         want you going to the dark side or 
                         passing out. Do you hear me? No going 
                         to the dark side.


                         Okay! Fuck!

               Miles quickly POPS A XANAX. Jack gives him a final look in 
               the eye.


                         We're going in.



               The boys enter this cozy if crowded restaurant and exchange 
               words with the HOSTESS. Then they notice --



               at a booth waving at them. They look great.



               make their way to the table, Jack wearing a broad, confident 




               Jack plops down next to Stephanie, while Miles politely eases 
               in on Maya's side. Jack touches a hand to Stephanie's bare 
               neck and massages it meaningfully.


                         How you doin' tonight, beautiful?


                         Good. How're you?


                         Great. You look great.
                              
                         You both do.


                         Not so bad yourself.

               Meanwhile Miles looks over at Maya and purses his lips in an 
               affable if uncomfortable smile. Then --


                         What are you drinking?


                         A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.


                         Oh yeah? How is it?


                              
                         Try it.

               As Miles swirls the wine and takes a sip, he begins to relax.


                         Nice. Very nice.


                         Twelve months in oak.


                         On a Sauvignon Blanc?


                         I know the winemaker. She comes in 
                         the restaurant all the time.


                         This is good. Little hints of clove.


                         I know. I love that.



               A WAITER finishes listing off the specials.


                         ...medallions of pork with a dusting 
                         of black truffles served with a root 
                         vegetable foulon and wasabi-whipped 
                         potatoes. And finally a Copper River 
                         salmon grilled on an alder wood plank. 
                         And that comes with roasted new 
                         potatoes and steamed watercress.

               The four diners exchange looks of delight.


                         And who gets the wine list?

               Miles raises his hand and takes the leather-bound book.


                              
                         I guess Miles wants it.

               Jack glares at Miles, who immediately gets the hint.


                         Nope. You ladies choose.

               Jack smiles and nods his approval. Jack takes the book out 
               of Miles's hands and offers it to the girls.


                         You choose, Stephanie.


                              
                         So what does everyone feel like?


                         Whatever you girls want. It's on us 
                         tonight. Sky's the limit.


                         No, we're paying for the wine.


                         I don't think so. We're celebrating 
                         Miles's book deal.


                         Well, in that case...

               Miles draws a long breath.


                         What's everyone ordering? Then we 
                         can sort out the wine.


                         Exactement!

               Jack shoots Miles a look.


                         I'm having the salmon.


                         That's what I'm having.


                              (still scanning the 
                              wines)
                         I'm thinking about the duck breast.


                              (slapping his menu 
                              shut)
                         Me too.


                         Well, that narrows things down.

               Stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over 
               the top. She looks at the others, and they look back at her.


                         Sounds like... Pinot Noir to me.

               Jack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a HIGH-FIVE.


                         Pinot!

               Miles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand. This causes the girls 
               to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF!

               DINNER is improvised, but includes:

               -- The arrival of the FIRST WINE.

               -- The SALADS.

               -- Maya takes a turn with the wine list. Miles pushes her 
               finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS.

               -- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND 


               -- The four of them DRINK. Particularly Miles.

               -- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier.

               -- The SALMON and DUCK arrive.

               -- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes. She's interested 
               and available -- it's too much for him.

               -- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier, 
               the cutting choppier.

               -- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya 
               and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his 
               jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't.

               -- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm 
               shoots out to stop him -- "Slow down."

               CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble 
               of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much 
               that he spaces out, descending into --



               Miles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river, 
               the River Styx. Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded 
               boatman CHARON wields a long staff. Miles is crossing over 
               to the dark side.



               Miles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in 
               their own little world -- Jack explaining something to 
               Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING.

               -- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused 
               expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent.

               -- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard.

               -- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie. They share a short 
               but sensual kiss.



               Miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables. 
               He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person 
               perspectives.



               He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked. He pulls the 
               XANAX out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing 
               it dry.

               He notices a PAYPHONE nearby. Thinking better of it for a 
               moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver.



               as many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely 
               out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone 
               RINGING and a PICKUP.



               As Miles presses it desperately to his head.


                         Hello?


                         Victoria.


                         Miles?

               Miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone.


                         Victoria! How the hell are you?


                         Fine. What's, uh, what's on your 
                         mind?


                         Heard you got remarried! 
                         Congratulations. Didn't think you 
                         had the stomach for another go-round.


                         Oh, Miles. You're drunk.


                         Just some local Pinot, you know, 
                         then a little Burgundy. That old 
                         Cotes de Beaune!

               Miles laughs at his own non-existent joke.


                         Where are you?


                         A little place in Los Olivos. New 
                         owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent 
                         food too -- you should try it. Thought 
                         of you at the Hitching Post last 
                         night.

               Silence.


                         Hello?


                         Miles, don't call me when you're 
                         drunk.


                         I just wanted you to know I've decided 
                         not to go to the wedding, so in case 
                         you were dreading some uncomfortable, 
                         you know, run-in or something, well, 
                         worry no more. You won't see me there. 
                         My wedding gift to you and what's-
                         his-name. What is his name?


                              
                         Ken.


                         Ken.


                         Miles, I don't care if you come to 
                         the wedding or not.


                         Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you 
                         guys have fun.


                         I'm going to hang up now, Miles.


                              (rushing to keep her 
                              on)
                         You see, Vicki, I just heard about 
                         this today, you getting married that 
                         is, and I was kind of taken aback. 
                         Kind of hard to believe.

               Silence.


                         I guess I just thought there was 
                         still some hope for us somewhere 
                         down the road and I just, I just --


                         Miles, maybe it is better if you 
                         don't come to the wedding.

               Miles sucks something from between his two front teeth.


                         Whatever you say, Vicki. You're the 
                         boss.

               He HANGS UP as nonchalantly as if it had been a sales call 
               and heads back to the table.



               For a flash, Miles is walking an unstable, narrow ROPE BRIDGE 
               extending vertiginously across a great CHASM.



               Miles reaches the table, tries to sit and SLIPS ONTO THE 


               Although at first Jack blinks heavily in disgust, the girls 
               burst into hysterical LAUGHTER. Jack then laughs too, perhaps 



                         Easy, boy. Easy.

               Maya helps him back into the booth.


                         Are you all right?


                         Fine. Just slipped.
                              
                         This is my blood.

               Miles drinks. Stephanie makes a head gesture to Maya, who 
               nods in return.


                              
                         Excuse us.


                         Sorry to make you get up again, Miles.


                         That's okay.

               Miles and Jack allow the girls to pass. Then --


                         What the fuck, man? What is up?

               Miles reaches for his wine glass, but Jack moves it away.


                         Pull yourself together, man.


                         I'm fine!

               But in throwing open his arms for emphasis, he spills a WATER 
               GLASS. Jack rights it and throws a napkin on the tablecloth.


                         Where were you?


                         Bathroom.


                         Did you drink and dial?

               Miles's silence confirms his guilt and shame.


                         Why do you always do this? Victoria's 
                         gone, man. Gone. Poof.

               Miles looks down and squeezes his eyes tight while pushing 
               out an exhale through his nose.


                         Stop it. You are blowing a great 
                         opportunity here, Miles. Fucking 
                         Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. 
                         She's funny. She knows wine. What is 
                         this morose come-down bullshit? These 
                         girls want to party. And what was 
                         that fucking ten-minute lecture on, 
                         what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come 
                         on!


                         Let's just say I'm uncomfortable 
                         with the whole scenario.


                         Oh Jesus, Miles.

               Miles belligerently reaches for his Comte Armand. Jack lets 
               it pass.


                         And don't forget all the bad times 
                         you had with Victoria. How small she 
                         make you feel. That's why you had 
                         the affair in the first place.


                         Shut up. Shut your face.


                         Don't you see how Maya's looking at 
                         you? You got her on the hook. Reel 
                         her in! Come on, let's rachet this 
                         up a notch. You know how to to do 
                         it. Here.
                              
                         Drink some agua.

               Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it.

               The girls now return to the table. The guys slide over.


                              (trying to appear 
                              sober)
                         Should we get dessert?


                         We were thinking. Why don't we go 
                         back to my place? I've got wine, 
                         some insane cheeses, music, whatever.

               Jack raises both arms like a football referee.


                         Excellent idea. Waiter!





               Trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed 
               into the woods.



               Jack drives. Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense 
               of A HAND-DRAWN MAP.


                              
                         Let me see that.



               The Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop 
               outside this wood-framed cottage.

               Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door. On the 
               way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string 
               of FOUR CONDOMS.


                              
                         Here. One for you, three for me.

               Miles wordlessly takes his. Just before they climb the porch 
               steps --


                         You sure you want to do this?

               Jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile 
               incredulity.

               THE FRONT DOOR is open. Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR 
               before going in.



               The boys enter this modest living room furnished with 
               weathered but charming old furniture. Scattered here and 
               there are CHILDREN'S TOYS. FINGER-PAINTINGS are taped to the 
               walls. CANDLES are lit, and MUSIC is playing.


                         We're here!

               Stephanie sails in.


                         What happened to you guys?


                         Couple of wrong turns.
                              (pointing a thumb at 
                              Miles)
                         Thanks to Magellan, here.

               After a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss.


                         Hi.


                         Hi.
                              
                         Maya's in the kitchen.

               Miles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward --



               Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little 
               temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT.


                         Hi.


                         Hey.


                         She got anything good?


                         Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots 
                         and Syrahs.
                              
                         Hey, Steph? You sure we can open 
                         anything? Anything we want?


                         Anything but the Jayer Richebourg!


                         She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I 
                         have completely underestimated 
                         Stephanie.


                         Who do you think you're dealing with 
                         here?

               Maya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX.


                         How about this?

               Miles nods vigorously. Maya looks back and forth between 
               Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. Then she slides it 
               back in.


                         Nope. I don't think we know each 
                         other well enough.
                              (picking out another 
                              bottle)
                         I'd say this guy's more our speed.

               They rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and, 
               raising his eyebrows, agrees. Maya begins opening it.


                         So what gems do you have in your 
                         collection?


                         Not much of a collection really. I 
                         haven't had the wallet for that, so 
                         I sort of live bottle to bottle. But 
                         I've got a couple things I'm saving. 
                         I guess the star would be a 1961 
                         Cheval Blanc.


                         You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's 
                         just sitting there? Go get it.
                              (pushing him, playfully 
                              stern)
                         Right now. Hurry up...

               Miles laughs, fights back a bit.


                         Seriously, the '61s are peaking, 
                         aren't they? At least that's what 
                         I've read.


                         Yeah, I know.


                         It might be too late already. What 
                         are you waiting for?


                         I don't know. Special occasion. With 
                         the right person. It was supposed to 
                         be for my tenth wedding anniversary.

               Understanding, Maya considers her response.


                         The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, 
                         that's the special occasion.


                         How long have you been into wine?


                         I started to get serious about seven 
                         years ago.


                         What was the bottle that did it?


                         Eighty-eight Sassicaia.

               Miles whistles and raises his eyebrows. Maya pours, and they 
               clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.


                         Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but 
                         this is tasty. Really good. How about 
                         you?


                              
                         I think they overdid it a bit. Too 
                         much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.


                              (tasting again, 
                              impressed)
                         Yeah, I'd say you're right on the 
                         money.

               Then Miles absently scans the REFRIGERATOR DOOR and spots a 
               PHOTO of Stephanie holding a LITTLE GIRL.


                         Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is 
                         cute.


                         Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.


                         Is she sleeping or...?


                         She's with her grandmother. She's 
                         with Steph's mom. She spends a lot 
                         of time over there. Steph's... well, 
                         she's Stephanie.  

               Jack's voice-over voice from the other room...


                         "And now for a low, low 4.8% APR..."

               ...is followed by PEALS OF LAUGHTER.


                         You got kids?


                         Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. 
                         That was the one unpolluted part of 
                         my divorce -- no kids.


                         Yeah, same here.

               Maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment, 
               thinking about something else.


                         Let's go in there.

               Maya takes the bottle, and they wander into --



               Jack and Stephanie are gone. From a distant bedroom comes 
               more laughter.


                         Looks like our friends are hitting 
                         it off.

               While Maya goes to turn down the STEREO, Miles sits on the 
               couch. Maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving Miles a 
               glimpse of the small of HER BACK.

               She takes a seat opposite Miles on the couch. They look at 
               each other without speaking. Just what is the vibe here?


                         It's kind of weird sitting here with 
                         you in Stephanie's house. All those 
                         times you came into the restaurant. 
                         It's like you're a real person now. 
                         Almost.


                         Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. 
                         Out of context.


                         Yeah, weird. But great.


                         Yeah. Definitely.

               An awkward silence, broken by Maya.


                         So what's your novel about?


                         Well, it's a little difficult to 
                         summarize. It begins as a first-person 
                         account of a guy taking care of his 
                         father after a stroke. Kind of based 
                         on personal experience, but only 
                         loosely.


                         What's the title?


                         "The Day After Yesterday."


                         Oh. You mean... today?


                         Um... yeah but it's more...


                         So is it kind of about death and 
                         mortality, or...?


                         Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It 
                         shifts around a lot. Like you also 
                         start to see everything from the 
                         point of view of the father. And 
                         some other stuff happens, some 
                         parallel narrative, and then it 
                         evolves -- or devolves -- into a 
                         kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- 
                         you know, with no real resolution.


                         Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing 
                         you're getting it published. Really. 
                         I know how hard it is. Just to write 
                         it even.


                              
                         Yeah. Thanks.


                         Like me, I have this stupid paper 
                         due on Friday, and as usual I'm 
                         freaked out about it. Just like in 
                         high school. It never changes.


                         A paper?


                         Yeah. I'm working on a masters in 
                         horticulture. Chipping away at it.


                         Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know 
                         there was a college here.


                         I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a 
                         week.


                         So... you want to work for a winery 
                         or something someday?


                         Well...


                         I do have a copy of the manuscript 
                         in the car. It's not fully proofed, 
                         but if you're okay with a few typos...


                         Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of 
                         typos.
                              
                         Wow, this is really starting to open 
                         up. What do you think?


                         My palate's kind of shot, but from 
                         what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty 
                         damn good.


                         Can I ask you a personal question?


                              
                         Sure.


                         Why are you so into Pinot? It's like 
                         a thing with you.

               Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question. 
               He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.


                         I don't know. It's a hard grape to 
                         grow. As you know. It's thin-skinned, 
                         temperamental, ripens early. It's 
                         not a survivor like Cabernet that 
                         can grow anywhere and thrive even 
                         when neglected. Pinot needs constant 
                         care and attention and in fact can 
                         only grow in specific little tucked-
                         away corners of the world. And only 
                         the most patient and nurturing growers 
                         can do it really, can tap into Pinot's 
                         most fragile, delicate qualities. 
                         Only when someone has taken the time 
                         to truly understand its potential 
                         can Pinot be coaxed into its fullest 
                         expression. And when that happens, 
                         its flavors are the most haunting 
                         and brilliant and subtle and thrilling 
                         and ancient on the planet.

               Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.


                         I mean, Cabernets can be powerful 
                         and exalting, but they seem prosaic 
                         to me for some reason. By comparison. 
                         How about you?


                         What about me?


                         I don't know. Why are you into wine?


                         I suppose I got really into wine 
                         originally through my ex-husband. He 
                         had a big, kind of show-off cellar. 
                         But then I found out that I have a 
                         really sharp palate, and the more I 
                         drank, the more I liked what it made 
                         me think about.


                         Yeah? Like what?


                         Like what a fraud he was.

               Miles laughs.


                         No, but I do like to think about the 
                         life of wine, how it's a living thing. 
                         I like to think about what was going 
                         on the year the grapes were growing, 
                         how the sun was shining that summer 
                         or if it rained... what the weather 
                         was like. I think about all those 
                         people who tended and picked the 
                         grapes, and if it's an old wine, how 
                         many of them must be dead by now. I 
                         love how wine continues to evolve, 
                         how every time I open a bottle it's 
                         going to taste different than if I 
                         had opened it on any other day. 
                         Because a bottle of wine is actually 
                         alive -- it's constantly evolving 
                         and gaining complexity. That is, 
                         until it peaks -- like your '61 -- 
                         and begins its steady, inevitable 
                         decline. And it tastes so fucking 
                         good.

               Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells 
               us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs 
               another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches 
               out and places one hand atop his.


                              
                         Bathroom over there?


                         Yeah.

               Miles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets and American 
               Spirit out of her purse.



               The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and 
               the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S 


               Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face, 
               trying to sober up and gather his courage. He stands, and 
               without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks. 
               Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands.


                         You are such a loser. Come on!



               Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's 
               not there.

               Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through 
               the door into --



               Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.


                         I was just getting some water. You 
                         want some water?

               Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water. 
               Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and 
               looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is 
               long gone.

               He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels 
               strained and awkward.

               After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.


                         Nice.

               But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading 
               back into the living room.


                         I should probably get going.

               Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.



               Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads 
               him through this very rural road.



               Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab. She puts 
               it in PARK and gets out.



               Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over.


                         You know how to get back to the 
                         Windmill, right?


                         Got it.


                         I had a good time tonight, Miles. I 
                         really did.


                         Good. So did I.


                         Okay. See you around.


                         Um... did you still want to read my 
                         novel?


                         Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.

               Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large MANUSCRIPT BOX, 
               and hands it to Maya.


                         Wow. Great.

               He turns around again, produces a SECOND BOX, and hands it 
               over as well.


                         Hope you like it. Feel free to stop 
                         reading at any time. I'll take no 
                         offense.


                         Goodnight, Miles.

               She gives him a friendly peck on the cheek.

               After she gets back in her car, she heads in one direction 
               while Miles heads in the opposite.







               Jack's cellphone RINGS.





               Still fully clothed, Miles staggers across the room.

               Fishing the phone out of Jack's windbreaker pocket, he looks 
               at the CALLER ID: "Erganian, Christine" and the number. He 
               briefly considers his options -- answer it? shut it off? --
               before placing it atop Jack's suitcase.

               The moment he lies back down on the bed, the MOTEL PHONE 
               RINGS. An old DIGITAL CLOCK next to it reads 7:l0.

               As Miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching 
               head, we again --





               VROOM! Outside a roaring MOTORCYCLE comes to a stop. Then 
               over the sound of an IDLING ENGINE come familiar if indistinct 
               VOICES and LAUGHTER.

               Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens.

               FOOTSTEPS pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself 
               in, flushed and exuberant.


                         Fucking chick is unbelievable. Un-be-
                         lieve-able!

               He pounds on the wall, then goes into the bathroom and without 
               closing the door unzips his pants to PEE.


                         Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty 
                         nasty nasty.


                         Well, I'm glad you got it out of 
                         your system. Congratulations. Mission 
                         accomplished.

               A hungover Miles gets up and looks out the door Jack has 
               left open. Down in the parking lot he sees --



               atop a mid-sized MOTORCYCLE, wearing a weathered fringed 
               suede jacket. She gives him a big friendly wave.



               returns the wave and goes back inside.


                         You didn't invite Stephanie to come 
                         with us, did you?

               With a FLUSH Jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his 
               bag.


                         Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's 
                         off today, so she and I are going on 
                         a hike.


                         We were supposed to play golf.


                         You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're 
                         brand new -- gift from Christine's 
                         dad.
                              (slapping some cash 
                              on the dresser)
                         It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, 
                         Stephanie and me were thinking we'd 
                         all go to the Hitching Post tonight 
                         and sit at one of Maya's tables, and 
                         she'll bring us some great wines and 
                         then we can all --


                              
                         Count me out.


                         Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last 
                         night, huh? That's a shocker. You 
                         mean getting drunk and calling 
                         Victoria didn't put you in the mood? 
                         You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's 
                         getting real old real fast, dude.

               Miles looks down. Jack heads for the door.


                         Later.


                         Yeah, well, maybe you should check 
                         your messages first.

               Jack stops, eyeing Miles suspiciously. Miles tosses Jack his 
               phone. Jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb. 
               He doesn't like what he sees.


                         Oh, boy.


                              (pointing at the room 
                              phone)
                         She's been leaving messages here 
                         too.


                         Yeah. Okay.

               He SNAPS the phone shut and puts it back.


                         You should call her.


                         I will.
                              
                         See ya!


                         Right now.


                         Okay! Jesus!

               Jack picks up his phone, sits on the bed and looks defiantly 
               at Miles.


                         I've got no problem calling her.

               Now Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to 
               his forehead as he begins to concoct the BIG LIE.


                              
                         Wait outside, will you?



               Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie.


                         That was fun last night.


                         Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a 
                         wine collection. Very impressive.


                         Thanks. Hey, I talked to Maya this 
                         morning. She said she had a good 
                         time too. You should call her.

               Miles says nothing.


                         Where's Jack?


                         He had to make a phone call.

               Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it 
               up on the kickstand.


                         So what are you up to today, Miles?


                         Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't 
                         know. Jack and I were supposed to go 
                         golfing.


                         Huh.


                         Yeah, I reserved the tee time about 
                         a month ago.


                         Oops. Sorry.


                         You golf?


                         Me? No, I think it's kind of a stupid 
                         game. I mean, at least, I could never 
                         get into it. I tried it once.


                         Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about 
                         it.

               Just then Jack cracks open the motel room door.


                              
                         Hey Miles. Miles.

               Miles ducks back inside.




                         Do you have that other condom?

               Miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil 
               square.


                         What'd Christine say?


                         Lucked out -- got voice mail. 
                         Everything's cool.



               Jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child 
               on Christmas morning.

               Miles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie, 
               grasping her waist.

               Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the 
               balcony.



               As we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to --



               Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails. SNIP, 
               SNIP, SNIP. MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of 
               solitude.



               Miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of 
               complimentary COFFEE from a PUMP THERMOS.

               Then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local TOURIST 
               ATTRACTIONS -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course 
               winery after winery.



               Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers. 
               He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS 
               play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS.



               The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling 
               errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out. Finding 
               a new error, Miles writes "NO!!!"

               CAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked 
               with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains.



               Miles FLOSSES, his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue. 
               Then he brushes with a SONIC-CARE TOOTHBRUSH.



               Miles checks his machine.


                         No new messages.

               He hangs up, disgusted.



               A small Buellton eatery.



               The only customer right now, Miles eats awkwardly with his 
               chopsticks.



               Miles DRIVES ball after ball, unsuccessfully trying to release 
               his frustration.



               The Saab roars past us, perhaps going a little too fast.



               Whistling absently as he drives, Miles leans over to turn 
               the radio on and fiddle around to find a good station. Then 
               all of a sudden --

               WHUMP! The car has struck something with a hideous sound 
               followed immediately by the receding "ARF-ARF-ARF-ARF" of an 
               injured DOG in the Saab's wake. Miles applies the BRAKES.



               Miles gets out of his car just in time to see --



               scampering into the nearby woods. Miles looks around -- has 
               anyone seen him? Is there a nearby residence? Finding nothing, 
               Miles momentarily weighs his options before finally GIVING 


               He follows the path of the dog into --



               Still hearing occasional distant barking, Miles finds his 
               way among the trees and bushes, looking in vain for the ill-
               fated cur.

               After a frenetic search, Miles reluctantly gives up and heads 
               back.





               Miles has returned to where he hit the dog. Just then, Miles 
               notices TWO MEXICAN CHILDREN watching him from just down the 
               road. They disappear into the bushes.

               Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs 
               behind the wheel and speeds away.



               The Saab pulls into the parking lot.



               Miles trudges up the stops to the room. He opens the door 
               and sees --



               atop Stephanie, plowing her fertile fields. Despite the 
               interruption, their pace does not alter.


                         Not now! Not now!

               Miles quickly shuts the door.



               Miles pours himself another glass of Pinot. Jack comes in 
               and spots his morose friend.


                         Hey, there you are.


                         Yep.


                         What're you drinking?

               Jack reaches over to check out the bottle's label. Miles 
               remains cool to Jack's amiability.


                         Any good?

               Miles shrugs.


                              
                         Could I get a glass please?
                              
                         Stephanie took me out into the Pinot 
                         fields today. It was awesome. I think 
                         I finally got a handle on the whole 
                         process, from the soil to the vine 
                         to the -- what do you call it? -- 
                         selection and harvest. And the whole, 
                         you know, big containers where they 
                         mix it. We even ate Pinot grapes 
                         right off the vine.
                              
                         Still a little sour but already 
                         showing potential for great structure. 
                         Stephanie really knows her shit, 
                         Miles.

               Jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine.


                         Where is Stephanie?


                         Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.


                         What the fuck are you doing?


                         What?


                         With this chick.

               Jack just looks at him.


                         Does she know about Saturday?


                         Um... not exactly. But I've been 
                         honest. I haven't told her I'm 
                         available. And she knows this trip 
                         up here is only for a few days. 
                         Besides...

               Jack stops short in a rare instance of self-censorship.


                         Besides what?


                         Well... I don't know, just... the 
                         wedding.


                         What?


                         Well, I've been doing some thinking.


                         Oh, you've been thinking. And?


                         I may have to put the wedding on 
                         hold is all.

               Miles looks at him with incredulity.


                         I fully realize that making a change 
                         like that might be tricky for certain 
                         people to accept at first, but life 
                         is short, Miles. I've got to be sure 
                         I'm doing the right thing before 
                         taking such a big step. And not just 
                         for my sake. I'm thinking about 
                         Christine's feelings too. I take 
                         marriage very seriously -- always 
                         have. That's why I've never done it 
                         before. The day I get married, it's 
                         going to be the real thing.

               Miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more.


                         Being with Stephanie has opened my 
                         eyes. She's not uptight or 
                         controlling. She's just cool. Things 
                         are so easy with her. Smells 
                         different. Tastes different. Fucks 
                         different. Fucks like an animal. I'm 
                         telling you, I went deep last night, 
                         Miles. Deep.


                         Deep.

               Miles draws a long sigh.


                         Don't get all judgmental on me. This 
                         is my deal. It's my life, and it's 
                         my call.

               They fall silent for a moment. Then --


                         I was hoping to get some understanding 
                         from you. And I'm not getting it.


                         Understanding of what?


                         Like I might be in love with another 
                         woman.


                         In love? Twenty-four hours with some 
                         wine-pourer chick and you think you're 
                         in love? And give up everything?


                         Look who's talking. You've been there.


                         Yes I have, and do I look like a 
                         happy man? Was all that drama with 
                         Brenda a happy thing for me to do? 
                         Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my 
                         life now?


                         This is totally different. I'm talking 
                         about avoiding what you're talking 
                         about. That's the distinction. I 
                         have not made the commitment yet. I 
                         am not married. I have not said the 
                         words. In a few days, I might get 
                         married, and if I do, then I won't 
                         be doing stuff like this anymore. 
                         Otherwise, what's the whole point of 
                         getting married?


                         And what about Stephanie? She's a 
                         woman -- with a kid. A single mom. 
                         What do you think she's looking for? 
                         Huh?


                              
                         Here's what I'm thinking. We move up 
                         here, you and me, buy a vineyard. 
                         You design your own wine; I'll handle 
                         the business side. Then you get 
                         inspired and write a new novel. As 
                         for me, if an audition comes along, 
                         hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.


                         You're crazy. You've gone crazy.


                         What do you care anyway? You don't 
                         even like Christine.


                         What? Of course I like Christine.


                         You said she was shallow. Yeah, and 
                         a nouveau riche.


                         That was three years ago after that 
                         first party!


                         Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an 
                         actor. All I have is my instinct.
                              
                         My intuition -- that's all I have. 
                         And you're asking me to go against 
                         it. And that's just wrong.

               Just then Stephanie walks in. She cozies up to Jack, and he 
               kisses the top of her head.


                         Hi, guys. We should probably get 
                         going.


                         Where?





               as a crazy car races through the obstacle-ridden track, often 
               leaving the road, much like Jack's libido.



               to reveal six-year-old SIENA seated in Jack's lap as they 
               drive together. A delighted Siena laughs and giggles.

               Miles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something, 
               two-pack-a-day MOTHER CARYL.


                         Stephanie's heard this a thousand 
                         times, but if I'd done what I wanted 
                         and I'd bought up in Santa Maria 
                         when I had the chance, I would have 
                         made a fortune when they put in that 
                         outlet center and that Home Depot.
                              (a drag off her 
                              cigarette, then to 
                              Stephanie)
                         Your father knew it too, but he was 
                         a fucking chickenshit. Always was.

               Caryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and 
               Siena, so completely happy together.

               Caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches. Stephanie is 
               equally enthralled. Miles takes it all in, trying his best 
               not to shake his head in disgust.



               Caryl is behind the wheel of her OLDSMOBILE as Stephanie 
               gets Siena buckled up in the backseat. Jack pulls Miles aside.


                         Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph 
                         and Siena get home safe, and then 
                         maybe we'll hook up with you later, 
                         okay?


                              
                         Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a 
                         movie.

               Stephanie kisses Miles's cheek before getting in the car 
               next to her mom.


                         See you, Miles. You take care.


                         Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.


                         Bye, Miles.

               As he gets in the car --


                         Call me on my cell if you go out.


                         Yeah.

               Miles watches them drive away, then heads toward his Saab.





               as Miles places a box of security ENVELOPES, a packet of 
               BEEF JERKY and some TROPICAL FRUIT SKITTLES.



               Miles points over the CASHIER'S SHOULDER.


                         And could I get a Barely Leqal?

               As the cashier reaches for the magazine --


                         NO, um, the new one.



               Miles is once again FLOSSING.



               POP! Miles opens a bottle of Pinot and pours himself a glass. 
               He carries it to bed, takes a nice big slug, lies down on 
               the bed and opens his magazine.



               The Barely Legal face down on his chest, Miles awakens with 
               a start and looks at the clock-radio. He thinks a moment, 
               takes a deep breath, and bounds off the bed.



               as little needles of water come at us.



               Miles takes a nice hot SHOWER. But wait -- he has forgotten 
               to put the shower curtain inside the tub. A closer look 
               reveals a growing PUDDLE OF WATER on the floor.



               Miles walks across the parking lot. He pauses before entering, 
               then forces himself to take the leap.



               Miles affects nonchalance as he searches briefly for Maya. 
               He continues on into the BAR.


                         How's it hanging, Miles?


                         You know me. I love it up here. How 
                         about you?


                         Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a 
                         busload of retired folks in on a 
                         wine tour. Usually they're not too 
                         rowdy, but tonight there was something 
                         going on. Full moon or something. 
                         What can I get you?


                         Highliner.


                         Glass or bottle?


                              
                         Bottle.


                         You got it.


                         Say, is Maya working?


                         Maya? Haven't seen her. I think she's 
                         off tonight. Say, where's your buddy?

               Miles just smiles.



               Gary serves Miles, alone at the bar. Miles takes his first 
               drink.


                         Oh, that's tasty.



               It's closing time. The front door flies open, and Miles 
               staggers out sideways. Gary follows him out, concerned.


                         You okay, Miles?


                         I'm good.

               Miles heads in the wrong direction at first, then realizes 
               his mistake and steers himself back toward the Windmill.









               The door bursts open, and Jack comes bounding in.


                         Come on, dude. Let's go golfing! I 
                         got us in at Alisal.

               Miles comes to, very hungover.


                         That's a public course.
                              
                         No Stephanie?


                         She's working. I need a break anyway. 
                         She's getting a little clingy.
                              
                         This is our day!



               WHACK! Jack TEES OFF with a manly athletic swing and shades 
               his eyes to watch the ball's trajectory.


                         Crap.

               Miles, disheveled and sullen, approaches the teebox, sticks 
               a tee in the ground and sets his ball.


                         Did you ever got ahold of Maya 
                         yesterday?


                         Nope.


                         She likes you, man. Stephanie'll 
                         tell you.


                              
                         Can you give me some room here?


                              
                         Oh yeah. Sure.

               Miles lifts his club.


                         You know, in life you gotta strike 
                         when the iron's hot.


                         Thanks, Jack.

               Miles refocuses and SWINGS just as Jack offers more helpful 
               advice.


                         Don't whiff it.

               WHACK! Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good, 
               long drive.


                         Nice shot.


                         You're an asshole.



               Jack is pouring two Dixie cups of wine as Miles prepares to 
               take his next swing.


                         What about your agent? Hear anything 
                         yet?


                         Nope.


                         What do you think's going on?


                         Could be anything.


                         Been checking your messages?


                         Obsessively.


                         Huh.


                         They probably think my book is such 
                         a piece of shit that it's not even 
                         worthy of a response. I guess I'll 
                         just have to learn how to kiss off 
                         three years of my life.


                         But you don't know yet, so your 
                         negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't 
                         you say?

               Miles says nothing.


                         Or fuck those New York publishers. 
                         Publish it yourself. I'll chip in. 
                         Just get it out there, get it 
                         reviewed, get it in libraries. Let 
                         the public decide.

               Giving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's 
               talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses.


                         Don't come over the top. Stay still.


                         Shut up.


                         Just trying to be helpful.
                              
                         It's all about stillness, Miles. 
                         Inner quiet.

               Miles drops his club and turns to Jack.


                         Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's 
                         the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!


                         Why are you so hostile? I know you're 
                         frustrated with your life right now, 
                         but you can choose not to be so 
                         hostile.
                              (holding out a cup of 
                              wine)
                         Here.

               Still fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a 
               taste. He's immediately distracted from his woes.


                         What is it?


                         I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.

               Miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste.


                         Huh. Let me see the label.

               Suddenly a golfball THUDS against the hard fairway directly 
               behind them.


                              
                         What the fuck?

               Way back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a FOURSOME 
               of two couples. One of the MEN is waving his driver.


                              (shouting, barely 
                              audible)
                         Hurry it up, will you?

               Jack looks at Miles, the two incredulous.


                         Fucker hit into us.


                              
                         Hey, asshole! That's not cool!


                         Throw me his ball.

               Jack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it 
               to Miles. Miles gets out his 3-wood and -- THWOCK! -- cuts 
               it back low and hard.


                         Nice shot.



               duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads.



               laugh hard.



               climb in their CART and hasten down the fairway toward Jack 
               and Miles.



               watches their approach, grinning.


                         Oh, this is going to be fun.
                              (jerking a driver 
                              from his bag)
                         This is going to be fun.

               Jack heads in their direction, brandishing the club like a 
               medieval knight with a mace.

               As the husbands get a look at this sight, they turn their 
               cart around and speed back toward their wives.


                         Hit into us again, motherfuckers, 
                         and I'll ass-rape all four of you!



               Jack and Miles are turning in their cart and hoisting their 
               clubs over their shoulders.


                         Just don't give up on Maya. Cool 
                         smart chicks like that --they like 
                         persistence.


                         I don't want to talk about it.


                         All I know is she's beautiful. Lots 
                         of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not 
                         going to feel good about this trip 
                         until you guys hook up. Don't you 
                         just want to feel that cozy little 
                         box grip down on your Johnson?

               Nearby a GOLFER is with his YOUNG SON.


                         Hey, you mind keeping it down, buddy?



               Miles and Jack walk toward their car.


                         Is it the money thing?


                         Is what the money thing?


                         With Maya.


                         Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman 
                         finds out how I live, that I'm not a 
                         published author, that I'm a liar 
                         essentially, then yeah, any interest 
                         is gonna evaporate real quick. If 
                         you don't have money at my age, you're 
                         not even in the game. You're just a 
                         pasture animal waiting for the 
                         abattoir.


                         Is an abattoir like a... like a... 
                         what is that?


                         Slaughterhouse.


                         Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to 
                         get the good news this week about 
                         your book. I know you are. I can 
                         feel it.

               Jack's CELLPHONE rings, and he checks the caller ID.


                         It's Steph.
                              
                         Hey, baby. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yesssss. I 
                         mean I would, but let me see. Hey, 
                         Miles... Oh fuck it, we're going. 
                         We'll be right there. Me too.

               He snaps his phone shut and turns to Miles.


                         We're on.


                         What's happening?


                         We're going to have some fun. Remember 
                         fun? We're going to have some of it. 
                         Okay?


                         What exactly are we going to do?


                         I said okay?


                         You have to tell me --




               Miles finally smiles.


                         Okay.









               The Saab pulls up where Stephanie and Maya await with bottles 
               of wine and a PICNIC BASKET. The girls climb into the back 
               seat, and the car speeds away.



               They're going FAST, hair whipping around.


                         Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the 
                         restaurant last night looking for 
                         me.


                         Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped 
                         by for a drink. Didn't see you.


                         I had class.


                         Well, nice to see you now.


                         You too.



               WHOOSH! That car's going a little too FAST!



               The two couples wander around this historic site.



               The girls have led them to a beautiful spot.



               we see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but 
               there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even 
               Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness 
               from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other 
               as they eat and sip wine.

               Finally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET.



               The parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed 
               toward the main building.



               A LECTURE by British wine sage LESLIE BROUGH is in progress. 
               He holds aloft a RIEDEL BURGUNDY GLASS containing one of the 
               few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention.



               As our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles.


                         You ever actually read any of this 
                         guy's books?


                         He wrote a great one on Burgundy, 
                         and I used to get his newsletter, 
                         but then there were doubts about 
                         whether he does all his own tasting. 
                         Plus a couple of times he declared 
                         certain years vintages of the century, 
                         and they turned out to be turkeys. 
                         Fucker never retracted.


                         Huh.

               Stephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a YAWN or a 
               GAGGING FINGER IN MOUTH that they hightail it. Although Miles 
               protests at first, they stand and leave.



               Stephanie finds a DOOR which she tests to see whether it is 
               open. It is! She leads her pals furtively inside --



               This is an enormous, dimly-lit chamber filled with stainless 
               steel FERMENTATION TANKS and stacks of OAK BARRELS.

               As the two couples walk in the near-darkness, they are 
               entranced. Maya takes Miles's hand and leads him away.



               In the background, Stephanie and Jack lean against a tank, 
               kissing.

               CAMERA DOLLIES to reveal Miles and Maya among the barrels in 
               the foreground. They are shy with each other, on the verge 
               of kissing but holding back.





               THREE BOTTLES OF WINE sit empty on the coffee table.



               The four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table. 
               They drink wine and pass a JOINT. Suddenly they explode in 


               A sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes. 
               Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his 
               arms, and takes her back to bed.



               The Saab pulls away from the house.



               Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand 
               at the Saab.



               Maya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little 
               woozy from the hours of drinking.



               Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles 
               hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear?

               Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans 
               forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is 
               immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long 
               KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes 
               the door in our face.

               The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS.







               The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a 
               blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand 
               picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to -- 



               It is a small, clean apartment furnished with simple taste.

               Maya is dressed in a ROBE and holds a COFFEE MUG. She drops 
               the paper on the dining table and continues into --



               where Miles lies on his stomach DEAD TO THE WORLD. His stubbly 
               face is squished against the mattress and he SNORES lightly.

               Maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot.



               This is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic 
               produce, candles and incense, honey and cider.

               Maya and Miles are shopping. Miles carries the bags.



               Across from each other at a PICNIC TABLE, and surrounded by 
               the remnants of BREAKFAST, Miles and Maya read the NEWSPAPER. 
               Miles is doing the CROSSWORD PUZZLE.


                         You guys should stop by the restaurant 
                         for lunch today.


                         Great. What's the latest we can get 
                         there?


                         About two-thirty.


                         Okay.


                              
                         Did you hear about this Bordeaux 
                         tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara 
                         Saturday night? It's a little pricey, 
                         but if you wanted to go, I'd be into 
                         it. Why don't you stay through the 
                         weekend?

               Miles has just figured out a difficult clue. As he writes it 
               down --


                         No, we've got to get back Friday for 
                         the rehearsal dinner.


                         What rehearsal dinner?

               Miles stops writing.


                         Who's getting married?



               Maya leads the way toward the Saab.


                         Were you ever going to say anything?


                         Of course I was. I mean, just now I 
                         could have made up some story, but I 
                         didn't. I told you the truth.

               Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break." 
               Miles reaches out to touch her.


                         Maya.


                              
                         Don't touch me. Just take me home.



               Miles drives, glancing occasionally at Maya, who stares 
               straight ahead.


                         I've told him. I've told him over 
                         and over, but he's out of control.


                         Do you know what he's been saying to 
                         her?


                         He's an actor, so it can't be good.


                         Oh, just that he loves her. That 
                         she's the only woman who has ever 
                         really rocked his world. How he adores 
                         Siena. How he wants to move up here 
                         and get a place with the two of them 
                         and commute when he has to.


                         I'm sure he believed every word.

               A stony silence.


                         Please believe me. I was even on the 
                         verge of telling you last night, 
                         but...


                         But you wanted to fuck me first.


                         Oh, Maya. No.


                         Yeah.



               Miles brings the car to a stop. Maya opens the door and begins 
               to get out.


                         You know, I just spent three years 
                         trying to extricate myself from a 
                         relationship that turned out to be 
                         full of deception. And I've been 
                         doing just fine.


                         And I haven't been with anyone since 
                         my divorce. This has been a big deal 
                         for me, Maya -- hanging out with 
                         you, and last night. I really like 
                         you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm 
                         just his... his freshman roommate 
                         from San Diego State.

               Maya wants to let Miles's words reach her, but she can't 
               just yet.


                         Could I have my paper, please?

               Unsure what she wants at first, Miles reaches into the back 
               seat for the New York Times. He hands it to her and watches 
               until she goes inside.



               Miles pulls up and parks.



               As Miles enters, a shirtless Jack drops the Barely Legal and 
               is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big BEARHUG. The 
               TV is on, perhaps showing an E! True Hollywood Story.


                         Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my 
                         boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is 
                         yo' daddy?


                         Put me down, Jack.

               Jack continues his paean to Miles's triumphant night.


                         I said put me down. Jack!

               Still gripping Miles in a bearhug, Jack flings the both of 
               them onto the bed. Now on top of Miles, Jack KISSES both 
               cheeks.


                         I'm so proud of you! Let me love 
                         you!

               Now they get up off the bed.


                         So tell me everything. Details. I 
                         like details.


                         No.


                         What?


                         It's private.


                         You're kidding, right? Tell me what 
                         happened, you fucker, or I'll tie 
                         your dick in a knot.


                         Let's leave it alone.

               Jack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension.


                         You didn't get any, did you?
                              
                         You're a homo.


                         Just stop, okay? Make something up, 
                         and that's what happened. Whatever 
                         you want. Write my confession, and 
                         I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me 
                         all the time! I can't take it! You're 
                         an infant! This is all a big party 
                         for you, but not for me! This is 
                         serious. And you -- Just... leave me 
                         alone, okay? You're fucking me up.


                         Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.

               Miles begins to calm down. Jack grows concerned and 
               sensitively puts one arm around his friend.


                         Did you have trouble performing? 
                         Yeah, that's...


                         Shut up! Shut up, Jack!

               The phone RINGS and both men look at it, silenced by the 
               ominous sound.


                         Don't answer it.

               But Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game 
               of Russian roulette.


                         I'm telling you, don't.

               Jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.


                         Hello? Oh, hey, honey. How you doing? 
                         Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
                              
                         Christine.

               Miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears. 
               His face is dark with resentment.


                         Listen, honey. Let me call you back. 
                         Miles and I are in the middle of 
                         something. No, it's nothing serious -- 
                         Miles is just having one of his freak-
                         outs. Yeah. Love you too. I'll call 
                         you right back.

               Jack hangs up.


                         This whole week has gone sour. It 
                         isn't turning out like it was supposed 
                         to.
                              
                         I want to go home.


                         Who's being selfish now? I'm the one 
                         getting married. I thought this week 
                         was supposed to be about me.


                         We gotta slow down.
                              
                         I'm so tired. Let's just get out of 
                         here.


                         I know what you need.



               Jack watches Miles be fitted for SNEAKERS. A SALES ASSOCIATE 
               ties Miles's laces.


                         There you go.

               Miles gets up and walks in a circle.


                         Do you like them?


                         Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're 
                         really sporty.


                         Are they too sporty?



               The boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying 
               a PLASTIC BAG with a string handle.


                         Feel better?

               Miles shrugs.


                              
                         Oh here, wait a second. I want to 
                         run in here real quick.

               He heads toward a TOYS STORE.


                              
                         I want to get something for Siena.

               Mildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store.



               Miles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They 
               pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to 
               turn in.


                         How about this one? We didn't hit 
                         this one.


                         Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.


                         You ever actually been in there, 
                         Miles?


                         I don't have to.


                              
                         I say we check it out. You never 
                         know.



               The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS, 
               whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of 
               letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly.



               The room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display 
               after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate 
               sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the 
               winery's logo.

               In the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays 
               soothing Windham Hill-ish music.

               The tasting bar is packed three-deep with TASTERS attended 
               to by HARRIED POURERS.

               Finally the POURER gets to their glasses. Miles chews a sip 
               and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp.


                         Tastes like the back of a fucking LA 
                         schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, 
                         hoping for some semblance of 
                         concentration, crushed it up with 
                         leaves and mice, wound up with this 
                         rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash 
                         bullshit. Fucking Raid.


                         I don't know. Tastes okay to me.
                              (looking at the tasting 
                              sheet)
                         Hey, they got a reserve pinot.


                         Let me use your phone.


                              
                         What's up?


                         I can't take it anymore. I've got to 
                         call Evelyn.



               Walking across the lawn outside, Miles holds the cellphone 
               to his ear.


                         Evelyn Berman-Silverman's office.


                         Hi, it's Miles.


                         Oh, hi, Miles. Let me see if I can 
                         get her.
                              
                         You're in luck. I'll put you through.


                         Miles.


                         Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite 
                         client.


                         How's the trip?


                         Good, good. Drinking some good wines 
                         and kicking back, you know. So what's 
                         happening? Still no word?


                         Actually there is word. I spoke to 
                         Keith Kurtzman this morning.


                         And?


                         And... they're passing. Conundrum's 
                         passing. He said they really liked 
                         it. They really wanted to do it, but 
                         they just couldn't figure out how to 
                         market it. He said it was a tough 
                         call.


                         Huh.


                         I'm sorry, Miles.
                              
                         So I don't know where that leaves 
                         us. I'm not sure how much more mileage 
                         I can get out of continuing to submit 
                         it. I think it's one of those 
                         unfortunate cases in the business 
                         right now -- a fabulous book with no 
                         home. The whole industry's gotten 
                         gutless. It's not about the quality 
                         of the books. It's about the 
                         marketing.

               Miles is at a loss for words. A distant RUMBLE begins to 
               sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.



               Once again we see the narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending 
               vertiginously across a great CHASM.




                         Are you there? Miles?


                         Yeah, I'm here.


                         I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. 
                         You've been a real trooper.
                              (loudly, to her 
                              assistant)
                         Tell him I'll call back.


                         So I guess that's it.


                         You're a wonderful writer, Miles. 
                         Don't be discouraged.



               Miles STAGGERS toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax 
               and downing a couple, as Evelyn's clichs of consolation 
               continue in his head.


                         Just hang in there, and who knows? 
                         After you get something else 
                         published, we can revisit this one. 
                         And next time we can try a different 
                         title.

               Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt 
               to steady himself. The RUMBLE grows deafening.



               Now inside, Miles grabs the first DIRTY WINE GLASS he finds 
               and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting 
               station. He pushes his way to front.

               The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop. Miles jacks it 
               back, immediately extending his glass for more.


                         Hit me again.

               The same small amount is poured and downed. Once again Miles 
               holds out his glass.


                         Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for 
                         it.


                         This is a tasting, sir. Not a bar.

               Miles slams a TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL on the table.


                         Just give me a full goddamn pour.

               The pourer turns away to serve another party. Miles looks 
               around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic 
               to this injustice.

               Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right 
               up to the brim and beyond.


                         Sir, what are you doing?


                         I told you I need a drink.


                         Then buy a bottle and go outside.

               The pourer grabs Miles by the wrist before he can drink.


                         Put the glass down.

               In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby 
               steps back.


                         You're going to have to leave, sir.

               The pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door. Across the 
               room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over.

               Miles hoists up the SPIT BUCKET, holds it aloft and starts 
               to GUZZLE it. Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto 
               his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes.

               The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags 
               him toward the EXIT. Jack catches up.


                              (to the horrified 
                              onlookers)
                         It's all right. His mother just died.



               Two PELICANS soar low over the water. One of the DIVES, 
               crashing into the water and disappearing from view.

               Jack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the 
               ocean, sharing a bottle of wine.


                         Just write another one. You have 
                         lots of ideas, right?


                         No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. 
                         I'm a middle-school English teacher. 
                         I'm going to spend the rest of my 
                         life grading essays and reading the 
                         works of others. It's okay. I like 
                         books. The world doesn't give a shit 
                         what I have to say. I'm unnecessary.
                              
                         I'm so insignificant, I can't even 
                         kill myself.


                         What's that supposed to mean?


                         You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, 
                         Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't 
                         kill yourself before you've even 
                         been published.


                         What about that guy who wrote 
                         Confederacy of Dunces? He committed 
                         suicide before he got published, and 
                         look how famous he is.


                         Thanks.


                         Don't give up. You're going to make 
                         it.


                         Half my life is over, and I have 
                         nothing to show for it. I'm a 
                         thumbprint on the window of a 
                         skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement 
                         on a tissue surging out to sea with 
                         a million tons of raw sewage.


                         See? Right there. Just what you just 
                         said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint 
                         on a skyscraper. I couldn't write 
                         that.


                         Neither could I. I think it's 
                         Bukowski.

               Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach.



               ZOOM! There goes the Saab.

               The CAMERA lingers behind and PANS to reveal THE DEAD DOG, 
               now covered with FLIES AND MAGGOTS.



               Jack and Miles pull into the parking lot.


                              
                         Oh, look. There's Steph!

               He smiles broadly and honks his horn. Miles turns to see --



               seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her 
               lap, watching patiently as --



               pulls to a stop in a parking space.

               Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches 
               in the backseat for his Sears bag.


                              
                         Hey, baby.

               Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack 
               reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL.


                         Look what I got for our favorite 
                         girl.

               Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging 
               the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms 
               with rage.




               She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE.

               Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands 
               over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he 
               rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed 
               lion.

               Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out 
               of range.


                         Stephanie! Stop!


                         You fucking bastard! Lying piece of 
                         shit! You're getting married on 
                         Saturday? What was all that shit you 
                         said to me?


                         I can explain.


                         You said you loved me! You fuck! I 
                         hope you die!

               With that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet, 
               she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike.


                         Fuckface!
                              
                         You too!

               As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded 
               friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.



               Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses 
               a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face.


                         Aren't you glad you didn't move up 
                         here and marry her?


                         Don't need a lecture. You fucking 
                         told Maya, didn't you?


                         No, I did not. Must have been Gary 
                         at the Hitching Post. I think we 
                         mentioned it to him the first night.


                         You told him. I'm fucking hurting 
                         here.


                         Keep it elevated.



               CLOSE ON A COSMOPOLITAN open to an article titled "24 Ways 
               To Please Your Man."



               Miles reads, while nearby a YOUNG BOY dry-heaves into a 
               garbage can held by his FATHER. An OLD WOMAN parked in a 
               wheelchair faces the wall.



               Miles is at a PAYPHONE. As he speaks he tries to peel off 
               the metal LONG DISTANCE STICKER.


                         Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.


                         It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if 
                         you even care, but I had to call and 
                         tell you again how much I enjoyed 
                         our time together and how sorry I am 
                         things turned out the way they did. 
                         I think you're great, Maya -- always 
                         have. From the first time you waited 
                         on me.
                              
                         And while I'm at it, I guess you 
                         should know that my book is not 
                         getting published. I thought this 
                         one had a chance, but I was wrong. 
                         Again. Don't bother reading it -- 
                         you've got better things to do. So 
                         you see I'm not much of a writer. 
                         I'm not anything really. The only 
                         real talent I seem to have is for 
                         disappointing people and now you 
                         know that firsthand. We're leaving 
                         in the morning, and I want you to 
                         know that I take with me wonderful 
                         memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really 
                         sorry.

               What else to say? He hangs up.

               He returns to his seat. A moment later he extends his legs 
               to look at his new SHOES now STAINED WITH WINE.



               Jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency 
               room, his face purple and swollen beneath the HUGE WHITE 
               BANDAGE that holds the NOSEGUARD in place. Miles walks with 
               him toward the exit.


                         Well?


                         I'm going to need an operation. Maybe 
                         a couple of them. They have to wait 
                         for it it to heal first. Then they 
                         break it again.


                         Good thing you have a voice-over 
                         career.


                         Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue 
                         her ass. Only reason I won't is to 
                         protect Christine.


                         That's thoughtful.


                              
                         Yeah.

               They walk by us and out the door.



               Jack sits in the Saab's passenger side with the seat almost 
               fully reclined. When his agony allows him to open his eyes, 
               he glares at the DANISH THEMED STORES lining the street. An 
               ABELSKIVER MAKER plies his lofty trade in a nearby window. 
               He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see 
               a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed 
               in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA. Jack 
               takes a slug of wine.

               Just then Miles gets back in the car.


                         I hate this place.

               Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills. 
               A closer angle reveals them as VICODIN.


                         Take a couple of these, and you'll 
                         learn to love it.

               Miles opens the bottle and hands Jack two PILLS.


                         Two for you. And two for me.

               Jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to Miles, 
               who follows suit.



               Jack and Miles sit across from each other. For the first 
               time we see LARGE PURPLE BRUISES on Jack's arms and chest.


                         So how did Stephanie know it was 
                         Saturday? We didn't get into that 
                         with Gary.


                         Huh. Let me think.


                         You sure you didn't say anything to 
                         Maya?


                         Sure I'm sure. And just what are you 
                         implying? I'm really pissed off at 
                         you about all this, if you want to 
                         know the truth. What's Maya going to 
                         think of me now just for associating 
                         with you? You're the one who's 
                         sabotaging me, not the other way 
                         around, pal. Not by a longshot.

               Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles.


                         I don't know. Just seems fishy.



               The boys lie on their respective beds staring at the TV. 
               Jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser MIRROR like a 
               large dog who has just been neutered.


                         What's it look like to you?


                         Looks like you were in a bad car 
                         accident.

               Jack turns to Miles, nodding and thinking. Then he looks 
               back in the mirror.


                         I'm hungry.



               Establishing. Thursday night is Cajun Wings Night.



               Miles and Jack are finishing their SALADS in the rustic- 
               themed restaurant festooned with animal trophies.


                         You know what I'm thinking?


                         What's that?


                         I'm thinking it's time to settle 
                         down. One woman. One house. You know. 
                         It's time.


                         Uh-huh.

               Jack nods his head with no self-awareness or acknowledgment 
               of the irony.



               mounded high with ribs, slaw, beans and butter-whipped mashed 
               potatoes.


                         Mm. Mm.

               Their cheery, saftig blonde WAITRESS removes several FOIL 
               PACKETS from her apron and places them on the table.


                         And here're your Handi-wipes.


                         Oh, so that's what those are? For a 
                         second there I thought you guys were 
                         promoting safe sex.

               The waitress OVER-LAUGHS and swipes a hand at her naughty 
               customer.


                         I'll be right back with more corn 
                         bread.

               Jack watches her go and leans in close to Miles.


                         I bet you that chick is two tons of 
                         fun. You know, the grateful type.


                         I don't know. I wouldn't know.

               Now she comes back toward the table carrying a BIG BASKET. 
               Beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons SH-SH-SH as she walks. 
               When she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket 
               using big TONGS. Jack watches attentively.


                         Nice technique there...
                              (checking her name 
                              tag)
                         ...Cammi.


                         It's all in the wrist.
                              
                         You know, you look really familiar. 
                         You from around here? Where'd you go 
                         to high school?


                         No, we're from San Diego. Why?


                         I don't know. You just seem really 
                         familiar to me. Never mind. Enjoy 
                         your meals.


                         Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek 
                         Sommersby?


                         Doctor Derek Sommersby? You mean 
                         from "One Life to Live"?

               Miles looks away and sighs.


                         You have to imagine him with a bandage 
                         and shorter hair.

               As Cammi stares at Jack, her face transforms in astonishment.


                         No. Way. No way!

               Jack smiles and nods.


                         Oh, my God!


                         Could you tell me where the bathroom 
                         is?


                              (her eyes barely 
                              leaving Jack)
                         Uh, sure, it's right over there, 
                         right past the buffalo.



               Miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as Jack's 
               flirtation with Cammi continues.

               The camera PANS with Miles as he walks by us and goes through 
               the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame 
               with the word "MEN."



               A TOOTHPICK DISPENSER as a finger tips it forward to dispense 
               one.



               Miles stands by the cash register and PICKS HIS TEETH as he 
               watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way.


                         She gets off in an hour, so I think 
                         I'm just going to have a drink and 
                         then... make sure she gets home safe.


                         You're joking, right?
                              
                         What are you doing? Un-fucking-
                         believeable. Can we just go back to 
                         the hotel and hang out and get up 
                         early and play nine holes before we 
                         head home?

               Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head, 
               thinking how best to put it.


                         Look, Miles. I know you're my friend 
                         and you care about me. And I know 
                         you disapprove. I respect that. But 
                         there are some things I have to do 
                         that you don't understand. You 
                         understand wine and literature and 
                         movies, but you don't understand my 
                         plight. And that's okay.



               as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment.







               Now comes the sound of hysterical KNOCKING.



               Despite the knocking, Miles remains motionless in bed, his 
               expression serene.

               Finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door, opening 
               it to find --



               silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn. He is 
               barefoot. In fact he is clad only in his UNDERWEAR. Hugging 
               himself, he PANTS and SHIVERS.


                         Jesus fucking Christ, it's freezing.

               He limps past Miles, yanks off the bed covers and wraps them 
               around himself.


                         Vicodin. Where's the Vicodin? My 
                         nose.

               Miles hands him the bottle, and Jack frantically pops a couple 
               of pills, chewing them like candy. He sits down and bends 
               over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash.


                         Fucking chick's married.


                         What?


                         Her husband works a night shift or 
                         something, and he comes home, and 
                         I'm on the floor with my cock in his 
                         wife's ass.


                         Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked 
                         all the way back from Solvang?


                         Ran. Twisted my ankle too.


                         That's five clicks, Jackson.


                         Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one 
                         point I had to cut through an ostrich 
                         farm. Fuckers are mean.

               Miles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole 
               scene, and he LAUGHS HARD. The blanketed bulge just sits 
               there. Finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage.


                         We gotta go back.


                         What?


                         I left my wallet. My credit cards, 
                         cash, fucking ID, everything. We 
                         gotta go back.


                         Big deal. We'll call right now and 
                         cancel your cards.


                         You don't understand. The wedding 
                         bands. The wedding bands are in my 
                         wallet.


                         Okay, so they were in your wallet, 
                         and you left your wallet somewhere. 
                         Some bar. Christine'll understand.


                         No. She ordered them special. Took 
                         her forever to find them. They've 
                         got this design on them with dolphins 
                         and our names engraved in Sanskrit. 
                         We've got to go back. Christine'll 
                         fucking crucify me.


                         No way. No way.


                              
                         Please, Miles, please.


                         Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at 
                         a bar. Happens every day.

               Jack stares straight ahead, breathing through his mouth as 
               he considers this. Then --


                         No, we've got to get my wallet! Those 
                         rings are irreplaceable! We've got 
                         to get them, Miles! I fucked up! I 
                         know I fucked up, okay? I fucked up. 
                         You gotta help me. You gotta help 
                         me. Pleeeease!

               Jack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation 
               that Miles has never seen before in Jack, or in anyone else 
               for that matter.


                         Oh, God, please... Oh God. I know 
                         I'm bad. I know I did a bad thing. 
                         Help me, Miles. Just this one thing, 
                         this one last thing. I can't lose 
                         Christine. I can't. I'm nothing 
                         without her. Please, Miles, please... 
                         uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu......

               No longer able to form words, Jack is reduced to emitting 
               low, primitive sounds. Snot flows from beneath his bandaged 
               nose.



               Miles drives in the early-morning light. Jack is now subdued, 
               quieted by his pain and exhaustion.


                         She tell you she was married?


                         Yeah.


                         So what the fuck were you thinking?


                         Wasn't supposed to be back till six. 
                         Fucker rolls in at five.


                         Cutting it a little close, don't you 
                         think?
                              
                         So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, 
                         say.


                         Horny as shit. Flopping around like 
                         a landed trout.



               The Saab creeps around a corner.



               Jack scans the street.


                         Yeah, this is the block. Just keep 
                         going...
                              
                         Yeah! This is it. There's her car.

               Miles pulls over and cuts the engine.


                         So what's the plan?


                         The plan is... you go.


                         Me?


                         My ankle. Just go explain the 
                         situation.


                              (sarcastic, clearing 
                              his throat)
                         Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend 
                         was the one balling your wife a couple 
                         hours ago, and he seems to have left 
                         his wallet behind, and we were 
                         wondering...


                         Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like 
                         that.

               Miles gives Jack a withering look. Jack reaches for the DOOR 



                         Fuck you. I'll get it myself.


                              
                         Hold on.



               Miles crosses the street and approaches --



               Miles presses his ear against the front door. Nothing. Then 
               he notices --

               A SLIDING GLASS DOOR a few feet away, just barely cracked 
               open.

               MILES creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and 
               pulls back the curtain to reveal --

               A LIVING ROOM the is hideously MESSY. Draped over a deformed 
               beanbag chair are JACK'S LEVI'S.

               Miles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass 
               door, and creeps inside.



               A furtive search of Jack's pockets reveals NOTHING. Then 
               Miles notices a HIGH-PITCHED SOUND wafting from an open door 
               down a short HALLWAY.

               Miles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the 
               floor. Again nothing. Meanwhile the noise from the bedroom 
               grows louder -- female MOANING in odd rhythmic unison with a 




               Miles gets on ALL FOURS and starts crawling, weaving his way 
               through a trail of shoes and clothes.

               Nearing the open door, the sounds grow more distinct --


                         You don't think I fuck you, bitch? 
                         I'll fuck you.


                         I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.

               Miles peers around the corner of the open door to see --



               Cammi is TIED to the faux brass headboard. A BIG GUY slams 
               away at her. In the corner a soundless TV shows a PRESIDENTIAL 



                         You picked him up and you fucked 
                         him, didn't you, bitch?


                         I picked him up and I fucked him. 
                         I'm a bad girl.


                         And you liked fucking him, didn't 
                         you, you fat little whore?


                         I liked it when you caught me fucking 
                         him.

               Whoa!

               Miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature 
               documentary and scan the room.



               to the WALLET atop the dresser.

               Miles's eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the 
               wallet. His HEART BEATING LOUDLY, he goes for it. He scrambles 
               to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and 
               tears out. Behind him he hears -- 


                         The fuck was that?


                         The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!



               Miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed 
               swiftly by the man, who is of course STARK NAKED. And he's 
               fast for a man his size.


                         Get him!



               Jack is reclined in the passenger seat FAST ASLEEP. On the 
               radio NPR'S CARL KASSEL reads the news.



               Miles comes sprinting towards us, mere steps ahead of Cammi's 
               naked husband. Finding the car door locked, Miles knocks 
               loudly on the glass, startling Jack awake.


                         Open up! Jesus! Open the goddamn 
                         door!

               Jack flips the electric locks just in time for Miles to get 
               in before --

               WHUMP! The guy's BELLY hits the window. He pounds on the 
               roof before trying the door, now re-locked.


                         You motherfuckers! I'll kill you! 
                         I'll kill you motherfuckers!

               Miles starts the car and begins to drive away. The guy tries 
               to keep up but can't, running barefoot on asphalt. Jack turns 
               to look --



               The guy recedes in the distance.



               removes the rings from the wallet.


                         You did it! You fucking did it!

               They LAUGH and SLAP HANDS.



               For all his failures, this time he did something right.



               The shades are drawn. Jack is CRASHED OUT on the bed, snoring 
               loudly. Miles folds his shirts and trousers -- readying his 
               bags for departure.

               At one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep.

               A KNOCK at the door. Miles goes to answer it, but once his 
               hand is on the knob, he pauses. If we're perceptive, we will 
               know he's hoping against hope that it's Maya.

               He opens it. It's just the MAID with her big CART.


                         Housekeeping.





               The Saab enters the freeway and heads south.



               Miles drives while Jack stares out the window, WATCHING THE 
               LANDSCAPE CHANGE as they leave wine country.


                         Hey, Jack. Jack.


                         Hrnrnrn?


                         That was quite a day yesterday.

               Jack's eyes close, but his lips spread into a smile.


                         Yep. Quite a day.


                         Quite a week.



               A driving shot.



               Miles pumps the gas, while nearby Jack stretches his legs. 
               As Miles puts the nozzle back in place --


                         Want me to drive?


                         No, I'm okay.


                         Hey, why don't you invite Maya to 
                         the wedding?


                         Somehow I don't think inviting Maya 
                         to your wedding is the right move. 
                         In fact, after your bullshit, it's 
                         going to be hard for me to even go 
                         to the Hitching Post again.


                         You're so negative.

               Miles replaces the hose and screws on the gas cap.


                         Come on, let me drive.


                         I'm fine. You rest.


                         I feel like driving.



               As the car makes its way back toward the freeway, Jack looks 
               over at Miles and slows the car to a stop.


                         What's wrong?


                         Nothing. Buckle up, okay?

               Miles obeys. Without hesitation, Jack accelerates and JUMPS 
               THE CURB, heading into --



               The Saab plows INTO A TREE.




                         What the fuck!


                              
                         You said it looked like a car 
                         accident.


                         What the fuck!


                         I'll pay for it.



               They get out to inspect the damage. The hood is slightly 
               crumpled, and the front fender is bent.


                         Look at this!


                         I don't know. Doesn't look like 
                         anybody got hurt in this one.


                         Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.


                         You need a new car anyway.

               Miles looks at his friend, incredulous.


                         I said I'd pay for it.



               The trunk is open, and the guys are unloading their cases of 
               wine. Miles notices that one box is DRIPPING.


                         You broke some.


                         Whatever. Sorry.


                         No, not whatever. You fucking 
                         derelict.



               Miles looks on as Jack hoists a FOUNDATION BLOCK toward the 
               open driver's door of the Saab.


                         You ready?

               Miles waves his hand in a gesture of "Get it over with."

               Grunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops 
               the foundation block onto the GAS PEDAL.

               Direct hit! Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in 
               time.

               Miles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the 
               tree, its speed increasing. But just before hitting it, the 
               car drifts to one side and SAILS RIGHT PAST.


                         Oh, fuck!

               The car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the 
               tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally 
               toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH. Only the back of the 
               car remains visible.

               The whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. Still 
               frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other.


                         It's okay. I've got Triple A.



               From in front of the Saab, we see its now CRUMPLED HOOD and 
               FENDER, a couple of BUNGEE CORDS holding the whole thing 
               together.



               The Saab approaches the end of the line.





               Miles has helped Jack carry his bags and the wine. He plops 
               the last case down.


                         Well. That about does it.


                         Why don't you come in?


                         Uh-uh. You're on your own.


                         So I'll see you at the rehearsal.


                         Yeah.

               They give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug.


                         Love you, man.


                         Back at you.

               Miles heads toward the curb.


                         Hey, don't pull away till they see 
                         the car.


                              
                         Yeah.
                              
                         Hey, why wasn't I injured?


                              
                         You were wearing your belt.



               Miles gets in and watches through the side window as Mrs. 
               Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock 
               and dismay. Jack points back at --

               MILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly 
               MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch --



               weaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants 
               to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the 
               door too. Mr. Erganian takes a few steps toward the car to 
               get a better look.



               watching the drama play out. Then his eyes drop as he 
               momentarily loses himself in melancholy. This reverie is 
               interrupted by --



               Startled, Miles turns to look at --



               who is singing the BLESSING OF THE RINGS.

               We are now in --



               The church is packed.

               CLOSE ON THE RINGS as the priest holds them aloft.

               If those rings could talk... Jack shoots a quick look at 
               Miles, who looks right back. The priest continues his 
               blessing.





               The WEDDING FAMILIES greet the exiting guests in a RECEIVING 
               LINE. Smiling and exuberant, Jack seems utterly at home as 
               the new groom.



               Miles watches the scene, not without melancholy. Then --


                         Hey, Miles.

               Miles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step 
               above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the 
               quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played 
               college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing 
               vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school.


                         Hi, Vicki.
                              
                         You look beautiful.


                         Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my 
                         husband.

               From his spot hovering over Miles, Ken leans down and offers 
               his hand.


                         How are you?


                         Hi. How you doing? You're a lucky 
                         guy.


                         Thanks.
                              
                         I'll wait for you at the car.
                              
                         Nice to meet you, Miles.


                         Ken.

               Exit Ken.


                         That was big of him.


                         Yeah, he's good that way. Very 
                         considerate.


                         That's great.


                         So how're you doing?


                         Since the last time we spoke? I don't 
                         know. Could be better. Could be worse.


                         So what's happening with your book?


                         Universally rejected. Strike three.


                         Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are 
                         you going to do?


                         Back to the drawing board, I guess. 
                         Or not. So... you're married. 
                         Congratulations. You look happy.


                         I am.


                         Seems like everyone's getting married. 
                         A year ago it was all divorces. Now 
                         it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.


                         I guess.

               Just then a BLACK LINCOLN NAVIGATOR pulls up alongside the 
               curb. The passenger side window is halfway down, and the 
               sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out. Victoria gives 
               Ken a little wave.


                              
                         Well, let's go have some champagne, 
                         shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.


                         Not me. I'm not drinking.


                         You quit drinking?


                         I'm pregnant.


                              (hit in the solar 
                              plexus)
                         Oh. Huh. Well...
                              
                         Congratulations again, Vicki. That's 
                         wonderful news.


                              
                         See you over there, Miles.


                         Yeah.

               As she gets in the car and cruises away, Miles glances back 
               at --



               -- where Mike Erganian is introducing Jack to some dear old 
               FRIENDS. Mike throws a loving arm around his new son-in-law, 
               and Jack is drawn into Mike's bosom.



               A HAND-PAINTED SIGN, attached to a STOP SIGH and decorated 
               with balloons, reads: "RECEPTION THIS WAY!" with an arrow 
               pointing RIGHT.

               One by one, CARS are making a right turn. But when his turn 
               comes, Miles turns LEFT.



               The Saab pull up outside. Miles leaves the car idling as he 
               sprints inside. Moments later he sprints back to his car, 
               this time carrying SOMETHING.





               His bowtie undone, Miles sits at a booth eating. He washes 
               down a bite by draining the contents of a big wax-coated 
               soft drink cup.

               He brings the cup to his lap and refills it from a BOTTLE OF 
               WINE hidden next to him. As he sets the bottle back down, we 
               glimpse the label: 1961 Cheval Blanc.

               He takes another sip. As the camera MOVES CLOSER, all the 
               complex emotions inspired by the wine ripple across Miles's 
               face.


                         "The marrow of his bone," I repeated 
                         aimlessly. This at least penetrated 
                         my mind. Phineas had died from the 
                         marrow of his bone flowing down his 
                         blood stream to his heart.



               The voice belongs to one of Miles's PUPILS reading aloud in 
               class. Other students follow along silently from their own 
               copies of A Separate Peace.





               Miles sits behind his desk at the front of the class.


                         I did not cry then or ever about 
                         Finny. I did not cry even when I 
                         stood watching him being lowered 
                         into his family's straight-laced 
                         burial ground outside of Boston. I 
                         could not escape a feeling that this 
                         was my own funeral, and you do not 
                         cry in that case.

               The students look up.


                         Do you want me to keep reading the 
                         next chapter, Mr. Raymond?


                              
                         Hrnrnrn? No, we'll pick up there on 
                         Monday.



               Miles enters his tiny apartment. He loosens his tie and puts 
               down his satchel.

               On his way to the kitchen, he presses a button on his 
               ANSWERING MACHINE. As it plays, he opens the REFRIGERATOR 
               and looks inside.


                         One new message.


                         Hello, Miles. It's Maya.

               Miles FREEZES, not wanting to miss a single syllable.


                         Thanks for your letter. I would have 
                         called you sooner, but I think I've 
                         needed some time to think about 
                         everything that happened and what 
                         you wrote to me. Another reason I 
                         didn't call sooner is that I wanted 
                         to finish your book, which I finally 
                         did last night.

               Miles's heart pounds.


                         I think it's really lovely, Miles. 
                         You're so good with words. Who cares 
                         if it's not getting published? There 
                         are so many beautiful and painful 
                         things about it. Did you really go 
                         through all that? It must have been 
                         awfully hard. And the sister character --
                         Jesus, what a wreck. But I have to 
                         say I was really confused by the 
                         ending. Did the father finally commit 
                         suicide, or what? It's driving me 
                         crazy. And the title.





               We see ourselves taking the BUELLTON EXIT.


                         Anyway, it's turned cold and rainy 
                         here lately. But I like winter. So 
                         listen, if you ever do decide to 
                         come up here again, you should let 
                         me know. I would say stop by the 
                         Hitching Post, but to tell you the 
                         truth I'm not sure how much longer 
                         I'm going to be working there. I'm 
                         going to graduate soon so I'll 
                         probably relocate. We'll see.



               Miles climbs the wooden steps and approaches Maya's back 
               door.


                         Anyway, like I said, I really loved 
                         your novel. Don't give up, Miles. 
                         Keep writing. You're really good. 
                         Hope you're well. Bye.

               Miles takes a breath. Finally he KNOCKS.
