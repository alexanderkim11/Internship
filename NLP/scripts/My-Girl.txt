        Setting: MADISON, PENNSYLVANIA 1972




                        
                I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet 
                seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. 
                And i've learned to live with this chicken 
                Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the 
                past three years, so I knew Dad would be 
                devastated when he learned of my latest 
                affliction.
                        
                Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left 
                breast is developing at a significantly faster 
                rate than my right. It can only mean one 
                thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.


                        
                O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of 
                the fridge.



        Vada closes front door and goes down the steps to a group 
        of boys


                All right, who's in raise your hand.

        All the boys raise their hands except Thomas J


                Are you coming or not Thomas J?


                I don't think so.


                I knew he wouldn't come.


                I can't, I have to go home.


                Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.


                Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.

        Group of boys enters house lead by Vada

        Once inside, the group is suddenly stopped


                        
                Hey, you didn't pay me!


                How do I know you were gonna show us one?


                You're such a baby.


                All right, here.

        Boy reaches inside his pocket, gets money out and gives it 
        to Vada


                All right, follow me and don't say a word.

        They walk towards two large doors, stop, and Vada turns 
        around

                You ready?

        They enter the coffin display room, and move over to the 
        coffin in the middle of the room

                You sure you wanna see it, or is someone 
                gonna go yellow belly?


                I'm not chicken!


                Okay. Lean forward.

        A tense moment as the coffin lid is flung open by Vada and 
        the boys gasp as they look inside


                It's empty!


                You're so weird!


                I want my money back!


                I was afraid of this.

        They begin to move into another part of the house


                Of what??


                Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not 
                completely dead, you know, like when they cut 
                a chickens head off and it still runs around 
                crazy.


                You're full of shit.


                I bet she's roaming around this house 
                somewhere.

        They open the door into the living room, where Grammoo is 
        in her rocking chair

                There she is, in the rocking chair.

        Pause, then Grammoo begins to rock the chair gently. The 
        boys all gasp and then all exit very quickly


                Hi Grammoo.

        Vada seats herself upon Grammoo's lap


                        (in distance, from 
                        downstairs)
                Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?

        Vada gets up and begins to leave


                Seeya later.
                        




                Did I tell you, he was my woodshop teacher.


                You took woodshop?


                Yeah, I made a tie rack.


                I made a tie rack.

        Vada comes down the stairs and stops just before the corner 
        that would allow her to see the corpse of Mr. Layton


                Ahem.


                Vada, just put 'em on the stool.

        Vada places the packet on a stool


                Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly 
                yesterday.


                        (completely ignoring Vada's 
                        comment)
                Ya, that rack holds six ties.


                I still have mine.

        Vada recognizes Arthur's voice


                Arthur!!


                Vada!!


                I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.


                Good for you baby.


                Once you put the hotels on board walk and 
                Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.


                I like to buy off all the railroads.

        Harry is slightly annoyed at Vada distracting them


                Vada, we're trying to work here.






                Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she 
                was gonna make a fur out of 'em!


                        
                Hand me the canula.

        Vada begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-diddy, Arthur joins in


                        



                Dad?


                I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't 
                sing.
                        
                All right Arthur, just a slide of the 
                needle.....
                        (fades out as Vada climbs 
                        stairs)

        Vada climbs stairs and stops to read patient note, CAUSE OF 



                        
                One nice model C-501 bronze stainless eternal 
                journey, yeah, you look like a champion.





                Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in?


                Sure, come on in.

        Vada and strange woman make their way to a desk in the 
        foyer, and sit down

                So, have you had the unfortunate experience 
                of recently losing a loved one?


                        
                Could I see your Dad, just for a second?

        Vada runs across to call downstairs




        Vada runs back to the desk

                He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton. 
                Prostate Cancer. Once it hits your prostate, 
                you're a goner.


                Oh.

        Harry enters


                How may I... Help you?


                I'm Shelly devoto. We spoke, the other day 
                regarding the make up artist job.


                Oh yes.


                It's still available I hope?


                I think it's still available.


                I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for 
                two years, at the "Dino Raphael" Salon, all my 
                customers cried when I told them I was 
                leaving.


                Uhh, Miss devoto...


                I have a wonderful disposition, I put people 
                right at ease.


                Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at 
                ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a 
                Funeral Parlor.


                They're dead?


                Yes they are.


                Stiffs??


                        
                Deceased.


                The add just said "Makeup Artist"

        Doorbell rings


                Ahh, excuse me a second will you?
                        
                Hi George, this is a twelve-fifty-eight, I 
                didn't want the burnished handles.
                        

        Vada looks out the window at Shelly's camper


                Is that your camper?


                Yes it is.


                That's really cool.

        Grammoo walks past in a fixed stare


                        
                Hello.

        Grammoo keeps walking as if she hadn't heard


                She's shy.


                Oh.

        Harry is standing at the door directing the men with the 
        coffin


                Just put it back in the display room fellers.


                Okay Harry.

        The men move off, Vada walks over to Harry


                Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?


                They come in all sizes honey, just like 
                shoes.


                Is it for a child?

        Harry hesitates


                Of course not.


                Then who's it for?

        Small pause while Harry thinks of a reply


                Short people, very short people.

        Shelly walks over to Harry


                Excuse me, what about the job?


                Pardon?


                I need the job.


                Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...


                Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my 
                former clients will eventually die, and all 
                your clients used to be alive, so they have 
                something in common.


                You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering 
                the phone.


                Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.


                Great, you can start right away. Call me 
                Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally 
                wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, 
                very much, but the....


                I promise i'll take good care of these 
                people, they deserve it, they're dead, all 
                they've got left is their looks.

        Harry and Vada exchange weird looks



        Vada and Thomas J are riding their bikes through town


                Hey look at this, no feet!


                Oh wow, a real evil canieval.

        Vada and Thomas J ride up through a garage





        Vada and Thomas J arrive outside the entrance to the 
        Doctors surgery, Vada enters and climbs stairs, she passes a 
        small boy in a wheelchair in the corridor, Vada enters room




                Hi Vada, what's wrong today?


                I'm very sick.


                Okay, take a seat, i'll check if the doctor 
                can see you.

        She picks up phone and whispers something inaudible to the 
        doctor


                Okay, he'll see you, why don't you go in?

        Vada opens door to doctors surgery and enters





                Well, what is it? I can handle it.


                You are perfectly healthy.


                That can't be, I have all the classic 
                symptoms.


                Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to your 
                house today?


                Yes.


                Vada you've gotta stop this, there's 
                absolutely nothing wrong with you!

        Vada gets up in a mood, puts hat on, and walks to the door, 
        stopping and says with condescending intonation...


                I'll just have to get a second opinion.



        Vada emerges from the building and gets on her bike


                So, what'd he say was wrong with you?

        Vada is turning and beginning to ride away


                The whole medical profession is a crack.

        Thomas J is trying to catch up


                Hey wait up for me!





        Vada slows down, stops and looks at a person on a ladder 
        painting a house


                Hey look!

        Thomas J stops also


                At what?


                That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.


                I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!


                Hi Mr. Bixler!

        Mr. Bixler turns around and sees Vada and Thomas J


                Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. 
                J! How's the summer treating you?


                It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the 
                books for summer reading.


                Really? Already? The summer's just begun.


                Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.


                No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about 
                you Thomas J?


                I haven't started yet.


                Better get on his case Vada.

        Mr. Bixler gets down off his ladder


                Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old 
                house?


                Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.


                This is one big house for one single person.


                Well, you never can tell...
                        (Vada gets worried look on 
                        her face)
                I might get a pet.
                        (Vada's expression relaxes, 
                        she smiles)


                How are you gonna get the money for this old 
                house if you're not working?


                Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this 
                summer, so, I'm doing some work.


                How much does it cost?


                Thirty five dollars.


                What do you get for that?


                Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. 
                This an interrogation Vada?


                No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off 
                War &amp; Peace.


                It's summer! You're kids! Go play!

        Vada and Thomas J ride off down street





                Wanna go to Gray's orchard and pick some 
                peaches?


                No, I'm going home.


                Why? It's not dinner time yet.


                Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go 
                home to eat.

        Vada accelerates leaving Thomas J in her tracks

                Don't pee on the hydrant!!



        Vada puts a record on to play.
                        (song is "Wedding Bell 
                        Blues")
        She then opens a drawer and picks up a class photograph, 
        with Mr. Bixler enhaloed in a heart shape. Music begins to 
        play and Vada sings along the first few bars whilst looking 
        at the photo longingly







                Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton's 
                hair. He kinda looked......
                        (she sees Vada lying down 
                        sprawled out on the floor)
                Harry, what's wrong with her??


                Oh, she's just pretending. Vada, get up here 
                and eat your broccoli!

        Shelly moves over and crouches down next to Vada


                        
                I think it's my prostate.

        All of a sudden, Grammoo begins to sing


                I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who 
                could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in 
                green pastures, I got my man, who could ask 
                for anything more?

        As this is being sung, Shelly slowly looks up with a VERY 
        weird expression, this is too much for her




        Shelly exits house and closes door behind her, and then 
        crouches down beside Vada and Thomas J


                Who's winning?


                I am.

        As Vada and Thomas J continue to play, three Vada-aged 
        girls come up to the end of the Sultenfuss' driveway


                Look, there's Vada and her little BOYFRIEND
                        


                He is not my boyfriend!


                I bet she kissed him on the lips!


                Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing?


                Yeah anyway.


                Come on let's go.


                Judy's father owns the movie theater and we 
                get to see all the movies WE want for free.


                Maybe you can come some time.


                Eeeuww, don't invite HER, she'll have to 
                bring her boyfriend.

        The two girls begin to walk off, Judy follows slowly 
        looking guilty and embarrassed by her friends


                        
                Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-
                I-N-G, first comes love, then comes marriage, 
                then comes Thomas J in a baby carriage.

        Judy wanders off screen, looking sorry for Vada


                You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls 
                upset you.


                I'm not upset. I will never play with those 
                girls. I only surround myself with people who 
                I find intellectually stimulating.

        Thomas J looks at Shelly and smiles, he is proud to be the 
        friend of such an intelligent girl


                        
                Want a piece of chocolate?

        Vada shakes her head


                Thomas J?


                I'm allergic to it.


                To chocolate?


                He's allergic to everything.


                Chocolate?




        Shelly notices a ring that Vada is wearing on her right 
        index finger


                Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.


                It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.


                It doesn't work, it always stays black.
                        


                It's only black when you're around 'cause you 
                put me in a bad mood.


                Maybe black means you're happy?


                I don't think so.
                        
                Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?


                She's crazy, she wants to go to school over 
                the summer.


                It's not a real school, it's a writing class, 
                I wanna be a writer.


                She only wants to do it because her sweetie 
                pie's the teacher.

        Vada is annoyed that Shelly now knows her little secret and 
        pushes Thomas J


                Shut your big fat mouth!


                I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask 
                your Dad?


                He won't give it to me.


                Well you don't know that. Ask him.




        Vada passes Grammoo and Harry who are watching a TV show, 
        she then seats herself next to Harry


                Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?


                That's a lot of money for a little girl.


                It's for school, for summer writing class.


                        
                Any more soda left?

        Vada pours Harry another soda


                Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.


                Last month you wanted to play the violin. 
                Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.

        Harry keeps his gaze fixed the entire time upon the TV 
        screen


                Dad?


                        
                I love this guy!
                        


                Dad??


                What?


                The money?


                Ahh, maybe next summer.


                He forgot about the time I wanted to be a 
                magician, I was really great at making myself 
                disappear.





                Wanna play?


                No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your 
                head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.

        Arthur grabs ball and begins to dribble it properly as a 
        demonstration

                See. You were looking at the ball. All right? 
                Keep your head up. Gimme some skin,

        They both give each other five i.e. Slap each others hands, 
        Arthur exits. Vada continues bouncing the ball, which 
        accidentally veers off and goes down the stairs into the 
        basement



        Vada goes very slowly down the stairs, and peeks round the 
        corner, she is clearly very scared of the basement and the 
        corpses contained in it, she then rushes down and grabs the 
        ball. As she turns around, Shelly, who is upstairs walking 
        through the house and sees the door ajar, slams it shut 
        unaware that Vada is down there. Vada runs up the stairs and 
        tries to open the door, she can't, drops the ball and starts 
        to yell out for help and bang on the it. Shelly hears the 
        noise and comes to the door. Vada, overcome with fear, sits 
        on a step, covers her ears and begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-
        diddy. Shelly yanks the door open and sees Vada crouched on 
        the step


                Vada? VADA?? What happened??


                        (extremely frightened and 
                        timid)
                My ball, I lost my ball.


                        (picking Vada up onto her 
                        feet)
                Come on sweetie.

        The two exit the scene





                Excuse me Harry?


                Uh huh?


                Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?


                Yeah.

        Harry gets up from his desk, moves over to Mrs. Porter and 
        observes Shelly's work, he looks unimpressed

                Didn't I give you a picture of what she 
                looked like?


                Yeah,
                        (searches pockets, eventually 
                        pulling out a photo)

        Harry compares photo with Mrs. Porter's face


                You don't like it?


                This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have 
                her looking like a two dollar hooker.


                        
                I think she looks nice! Her lips are very 
                thin so I used the gloss to give them a more 
                sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a 
                little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, 
                nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.


                She did. This photo was taken a month ago at 
                the church food drive.


                I just wanted to get past this "old school 
                Marm" image.


                That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school 
                Marm.
                        
                Fix it.

        Harry begins to leave


                Harry?
                        (Harry stops and turns 
                        around)
                I was just wondering, if there is anything 
                wrong with Vada.


                What do you mean??


                Well the other night at dinner...


                Oh that, she just likes to play.


                I don't think so, I think she's confused 
                about death.


                She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a 
                thing or two about it.


                Harry, I really think she.....


                        
                She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, 
                look, don't give me any advice about my 
                daughter, okay?







                There's Shelly!

        Vada and Thomas J stop turning the rope leaving Phil 
        standing there exhausted, and run over to Shelly's camper, 
        Shelly gets out


                Hi.


                Can we look around in your camper?


                Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.

        Vada and Thomas J rush inside the camper

                        (surprised at Vada and Thomas 
                        J's eagerness to get inside)
                Woah! Gosh!

        Thomas J seats himself at the drivers seat and makes "vroom 
        vroom" noises, Vada sits at the table, selects a book from a 
        small bookshelf on the side, and begins to read it


                Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you 
                really eat and sleep here?


                Uh huh.


                I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.


                Liverpool?


                Big Ringo fan.


                Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?


                I would.


                Thomas?


                Yes please.

        Thomas uproots himself and sits opposite Vada at the table


                What are you reading?

        Vada makes a gesture at Thomas J with her finger up to her 
        lips implying that he should be quiet

        Shelly notices Vada reading the book


                Oh! You shouldn't be looking at that, it's a 
                little too old for you.

        She takes the book away from her


                Did you read ALL these books?


                Uh huh.


                What are they about?


                Mostly love, and romance.


                Eeeeuuuww, gross.


                They're just fun to read.

        Shelly hands the soda around

                Here, cheers.

        Everybody takes a mouthful of drink


                Are you married?


                No, I'm divorced.


                Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.


                Well, sometimes married people just find out 
                they can't live with each other.


                Mine aren't divorced.

        Thomas J gets up and reaches for the cookie jar

                Shelly, can I have a cookie?


        With bottle of soda in mouth
                Hmmmph gurgle gurgle...

        Thomas pulls out a few bank notes of largish denomination


                Hey, where are all the cookies??

        Vada sees the money and the expression on her face shows 
        she has an idea


                Well, I guess you found my secret hiding 
                place.


                What are you saving for?


                Nothing in particular, just putting it away 
                for a rainy day.

        Cuckoo clock goes "Cuckoo." Lunch time, 12 o'clock


                I'm supposed to be home at noon for lunch, 
                thanks Shelly.

        Thomas J leaves


                Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head 
                back?


                Can I use your bathroom first?


                Sure.


                You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if 
                you're late.


                Okay.

        Shelly exits and Vada enters toilet with a VERY guilty look 
        on her face




                The great way, is not difficult for those 
                with no preferences, with the absence of both 
                love and hate, everything becomes clear and 
                undisguised. That was written by a Chinese 
                Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I 
                choose to bring that up in a creative writing 
                class? Because, the absence of judgment helps 
                us to appreciate reality. In other words, I 
                want you to listen to your classmates writing, 
                with a clear and open heart, okay? So who's 
                gonna go first?


                I got one.

        He gets up

                I sang a song for you to hear, I painted a 
                picture for you to see, I picked a rose for 
                you to smell, I planted grass for you to 
                touch, But you did not hear my song, You did 
                not see my picture, You did not smell my rose 
                and YOU did not touch my grass.

                Woman
                Maybe she was outta town?


                That's not funny, his poem is about futility, 
                we toil in unrewarded obscurity.


                Now, I hear judgment, let's not forget the 
                part about the open heart...

        The door at the back of the room opens and Vada enters 
        holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous

                Vada, is there, something I can do for you?


                        
                I paid the money.


                For this class?


                Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.


                Vada, this is an adult writing class.


                Hey, I think it's real beautiful. She want's 
                to be a writer.


                Vada, you sure you wanna do this?

        Vada nods her head


                Welcome to the class, go find a seat.

        The class applauds

                Okay ahh, who's next?


                I experienced something with my boyfriend the 
                other day, and I wrote a few words down.


                The floor's yours Ronda.


                He covers me like a blanket, from the cold, 
                dark night, As I look into his eyes, I know 
                it's right, To touch, To feel, I know he's 
                real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh ALL a mush, I 
                can't fight it, There's no point, I wake up in 
                Lighter joint.

        Several looks glance around the room. Vada raises her hand


                Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.


                I wrote a poem too.


                Please.


                Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss
                I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good 
                when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, 
                This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate 
                or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.

                That's all I got so far.


                I hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky 
                Road, it's about desire.


                Vada that's... It's very sweet, and it rhymes 
                and that's also good  but, you're not 
                expressing to me what's in your soul. I want 
                you to show me how you see the world, your 
                fears, your desires, your innermost secrets.


                My fears and secrets. I'm afraid I killed my 
                mother.




        Shelly gets up smiling when she hears the music and 
        proceeds to the living room

        Shelly pokes her head in the door to see Harry playing a 
        tune to Grammoo on his tuba


                        
                Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.


                Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let 
                you know that the flowers were delivered. And 
                the room's all set up.


                Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the 
                other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a 
                little harsh.


                I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's 
                business. It's just that I like Vada, very 
                much.


                After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to 
                help take care of Vada. They were very close, 
                but lately as her mind's been wandering more 
                and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm 
                sure she'll snap out of it though.


                I'm sure she will.








                Nothing's biting today.


                Maybe they had a big breakfast.


                        
                I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.


                Big deal, I can do that too.
                        (Thomas J's reel begins to 
                        click)
                Thomas J, you got something!


                Oh no!
                        



                Hurry!


                I'm trying.


                Reel it in.
                        
                He's only tiny, throw him back.


                I don't like touching fish, how do you pull 
                the hook out without touching it?

        Thomas J puts his foot on the fish and pulls


                You're hurting him, don't kill him!!

        The hook is out of the fish's mouth and sitting on the pier

        Vada then removes the hook from the fish's mouth {minor 
        error in film} and in the process pricks herself


                Ouch! Darn hook!

        Vada puts the fish back


                I'm bleeding, did he get away? Go look.

        Thomas J looks and sees the fish, dead, floating on top of 
        the water


                Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.


                Hey, we can become blood brothers.


                Naah, I don't wanna.


                You could pick that scab on your arm.


                It's a mosquito bite.


                It'll bleed.


                If I do it, can we go?


                Uh huh.


                Okay, OW!

        Thomas J picks the scab on his arm which begins to bleed


                Okay, rub them together.

        They rub their cuts together


                Now we're blood brothers for life.





                Hi.


                Oh Hi, what can I do for you?


                Nothing, I was just wondering what you were 
                doing.


                Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you 
                know when someone dies people want it in the 
                paper usually, it's a service we provide for 
                the family.


                Oh right, right,

                I wrote that.


                No kidding?

        Harry gives Shelly a matter-of-fact look


                Oh it's good, "In lieu of" I love that word 
                lieu.


                I prefer it to "instead", it has more 
                dignity.


                In lieu... "instead".... No contest.


                It's no big deal.


                You have to learn how to take a complement.

                        over)
                Movies, movies, ahhhh, "Love Story" at the 
                drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?


                I haven't been to the movies in AGES.


                I love going to movies, especially at the 
                drive in. I don't think there's anything more 
                romantic than going to the drive in.
                        
                I'll let you get back to work.

        Shelly begins to exit with a look of failure on her face


                I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to 
                join me for a game tomorrow night at church 
                you're welcome to.


                        
                Okay.

        Harry resumes typing





                Hi Vada.


                Are you going out somewhere?


                No.


                So how come you're putting lipstick on?


                A girl's always gotta look her best.


                I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are 
                that color.


                Have you ever tried any?


                No.


                Come here, sit down.

        Vada enters bathroom and sits down on the closed toilet 
        seat, Shelly brings up a stool and sits down in front of 
        Vada. Vada gets some lipstick put on her


                Now, first we blot.

        Vada blots her lips on some tissue


                Take a look. I think it looks real nice on 
                you.

        Vada looks in Shelly's mirror


                Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?


                Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've 
                got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest 
                little nose, an amazing mouth.


                The boys at school don't think I am.


                They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna 
                bring out the gorgeous color in them. The 
                first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can 
                never wear enough blue eye shadow.


                Do you like putting makeup on people?


                Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to 
                Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the 
                stars, I haven't gotten there yet.
                        
                All right, open your eyes.

        Vada opens her eyes and looks in the mirror


                Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that 
                Hollywood thing.







                Your lip bleeding?


                No.


                What's wrong with your eyes?


                A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.


                Where's your bike?


                Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.

        The two enter the garage, where a large black hearse is 
        parked


                It's only a garage, come on.

        Vada notices that one of her streamers on her bike is gone


                Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably 
                fell off in here.

        Thomas J walks over to a model of a head


                Hey look at this!


                That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, 
                they used to study the bumps in your head to 
                see if you had a good personality or not. Come 
                here, i'll diagnose your head.


                No, I don't wanna.


                Come on, it's fun.

        Vada examines Thomas J's head and then compares it with the 
        chart


                Hmmmm, interesting.


                What?


                You have no personality.


                Hey, where does it say that?


                Never mind.

        Thomas J knocks the lid off a small box and reveals a photo


                Is that your Dad?


                Yes.


                Who's that with your Dad?


                It's my mother.


                Do you remember her?


                No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.


                What do you think it's like?


                What?


                Heaven.


                I think, everybody gets their own white 
                horse, and all they do is ride and eat 
                marshmallows all day, and everybody's best 
                friends with everybody else, when you play 
                sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets 
                picked last.


                But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?


                It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular 
                horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal 
                if you fall, you just land in cloud.


                That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll 
                never find that streamer.

        As they leave, Vada turns back and grabs the photo, then 
        returns to Thomas J




        The tune "Moonglow" is playing on the radio


                Well well well, what's going on in here?


                Nothing, I'm dressing.


                Oh, you're dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry 
                Harry Harry, don't you know it's not nice to 
                lie to your big brother?

        Phil then proceeds to give Harry a noogie





        Phil stops

                I'm going out with Shelly.


                Oh yes, oh that's great.


                I'm very nervous.


                Why?


                The last date I had was twenty years ago.


                That's true. Harry Harry sit down, let me 
                fill you in on today's women, since the last 
                time you dated, something happened, "The 
                Sexual Revolution", now before that, you used 
                to have to hold a door open for a woman, pull 
                her chair out, pick up the check, no more no 
                more, you wanna know what else is missing? 



                Oh come on.


                Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this 
                woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her 
                like every Tom Dick and Harry.


                Are you sure about all this?


                Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?


                Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any 
                minute.


                Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the 
                right track.


                No, she's just driving over here, then we're 
                taking my car. How do I look?


                Like a Sultenfuss. Go get 'em.

        Harry runs down the stairs and passes Vada on the way


                Goodnight Vada.


                Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?


                Ahh, I just wanna look nice.


                You never cared before.


                Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go 
                together.


                Why?


                She likes to play bingo.


                Can I go too?


                Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep 
                Grammoo company.

        Harry leaves and then Vada makes a decision, she goes out 
        the door



        Vada approaches the Sennet's house and signals through the 
        window for Thomas J to come outside, which he does


                Vada? Vada?? Where are you??

        Vada springs up from her hiding place


                Here.


                Don't DO that!!


                Sorry.


                What do you want? My mom will skin me alive 
                if she finds I'm out here.


                Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo 
                tonight.


                I told you i'll get in trouble.


                Pacifist!


                I am not.


                Bed wetter!


                I stopped that!





                Don't worry, there's a strategy to bingo. For 
                instance, on a given night anybody can win, 
                but I play the odds, when choosing bingo 
                cards, I use a range of theories from the laws 
                of probability to avoiding duplicate number 
                systems. This way you get much more activity.


                        
                Does it make it easier to win?


                No. Just, more activity.

        Harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it, cutting 
        Shelly off, who has to pull her own seat out and sit down


                        (as he sits down, to the 
                        person next to him)
                Hi Carl.



        Vada and Thomas J are walking up to the church


                They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.


                We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.


                Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.


                Duck!

        Vada and Thomas J are ducking behind a counter on one side 
        of the church, Harry and Shelly are quite clearly visible on 
        the other side of the room


                        (in the distance, as a number 
                        is announced)
                Oh great!


                Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.


                Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.


                        (in the distance again, as 
                        another number is announced)
                Aarrggh.



        As Shelly looks around the bingo table, she notices that 
        everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big 
        way


                I just had a terrible thought Harry.


                What's that?


                I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these 
                people very soon.


                Why d'you think these seats were empty.




                Can we go yet?


                Go???


                You know I'm not allowed outside my myself 
                after dark.




                Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.


                Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending 
                upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 
                10 cards could win just as easily as a guy 
                with 100.


                Kinda like men.


                Oh, how do you mean?


                You can be in a room with 100 men, and not 
                like any of them, or you can be in a room with 
                just one man, and he's exactly the one you 
                want.

        Harry and Shelly are about to kiss each other, Vada sees 
        this and doesn't look too happy about it


                        



                We have a winner. Will the winner please 
                raise their hand?


                There was no bingo, it came from outside.


                How could someone outside get a bingo?


                Someone outside didn't get a bingo, someone 
                outside yelled bingo you moron!


                Who are you calling a mowon?
                        


                Put a lid on it Vernon!


                Put a lid on it?? If you weren't 200 years 
                old, I'd kick your wrinkled ARSE!!

        The two old men then have a fight, Harry attempts to break 
        it up


                Hey fellers fellers, it's just a bingo game.

        Meanwhile, Shelly has found it all rather amusing




                We can go now.

        Vada and Thomas J run off down the street



        As she hears Harry's car approaching, she goes to her 
        window and looks out it through the venetian blinds



        Harry gets out of his side, comes round to the other side 
        and then hesitates before deciding to follow his brothers 
        advice and let Shelly get out herself, which she does, 
        eventually


                I had a good time tonight.


                I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.

        They walk up to Shelly's camper


                Would you like to come in and see my house? 
                Just for a minute.


                Okay, sure.

        They enter, Vada continues to watch them from her room




                Home sweet home.


                It's nice.


                I did it myself. I read a magazine article 
                about how to maximize small spaces.


                Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.


                You can look in the bathroom if you want. 
                People are always curious about that, like 
                what happens when you flush.

        Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the 
        bathroom, and then flushes the toilet


                Yeah.


                Are you mad at me?


                No, why?


                I don't know, tonight you just seemed a 
                little cool, not opening car doors and...


                Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice 
                on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of 
                touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not 
                since my wife died.


                What happened to her?


                Ahh, complications during child birth, she 
                died two days after Vada was born.


                Did she ever see Vada?


                I brought the baby into the room a couple of 
                times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think 
                she saw Vada. It was.....

        Harry looks at the item that he picked up and was fiddling 
        with to calm his nerves

                Did I ruin this?


                Dance with me?


                Here?


                This is where we are.


                Is there enough room?

        Shelly moves an object from the floor, which creates more 
        room


                I haven't danced in.....


                In ages, I know, me neither.

        They begin a slow dance


                Rock?


                See, you're not that out of touch.
                        
                You're good.


                At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot 
                date, I did a killer frugue.

        Shelly smells Harry's neck


                What are you wearing?


                Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.

        They continue to dance


                Do you want to?


                Want to what?


                Kiss me.


                Yes.


                Good.

        They then have a long kiss


                Good at kissing, and dancing, I'm very 
                optimistic.

        They then kiss again, this time interrupted by the clock 
        cuckooing


                I ahh, better go.


                It's only eight o'clock.


                Goodnight Shelly.


                Goodnight.

        Harry exits the camper followed by Shelly who stands at the 
        door





                Well, I guess it's official we had a date, 
                maybe we can play bingo again sometime.


                I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that 
                drive in of yours.


                Goodnight.

        Harry waves



        Vada finishes watching, and goes to bed




                Before the class started, Ronda and Justin 
                wanted to lead the class in a group 
                meditation.


                Ooooh that's really cool.


                Okay what we're gonna do is, send our vibes 
                out into the group.

        Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play 
        weird music


                Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes. 
                Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.


                Now, try to feel what the other person is 
                feeling, without speaking any words, send out 
                your vibe, and receive the vibes around you at 
                the same time. Can you feel it?


                Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody 
                feel?


                I felt Mrs. Hunsaker's strength.


                I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth, 
                she's so cosmically in tune.


                So right on, that's exactly what I sent out, 
                and I felt like, you were full of inner peace 
                and harmony.


                Vada, what did you feel.


                I felt Justin's hangnail.


                No Vada, that's not what we're looking for, a 
                hangnail is insignificant. What's in my soul, 
                feel my aura.


                I don't think I'm allowed to.


                I tell you what, let's try it again, hold 
                hands.


                Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe. 
                It got infected and traveled to her vocal 
                chords, it ruined her singing voice, I don't 
                think Grammoo thought it was insignificant.



        Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo, 
        she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed 
        and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual 
        healing




                Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get 
                lettuce.

        Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out


                Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.


                Hi.


                I'm just picking some things up for the 
                barbecue.


                Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?


                Not at all. Lot of potatoes!


                It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.


                I'm looking forward to that.

        Vada, who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and 
        Shelly, obviously does not like the idea of Harry &amp; Shelly, 
        and she rams her cart into Harry


                HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're 
                doing.


                Sorry.


                You know this is gonna be my first 4th of 
                July picnic in a long time.


                Really?


                        (picking up large can of 
                        prunes)
                Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL 
                bad?


                Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the 
                cart, anything at all.
                        
                I don't know what's gotten into her today.

        Vada begins to throw cans of every description from the 
        shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals, not 
        giving a stuff what they contain


                I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie 
                dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas 
                I got them a camper, and all they wanted to do 
                was hang out in it by themselves. So I wasn't 
                too upset when they took that wrong turn and 
                went over a cliff.












                Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to 
                use fewer briquettes and now look what you've 
                done. You've cremated them.


                That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??


                No, no no....


                Look if you think you know how, why don't you 
                pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, 
                put out a product, support me for a while!

        Phil exits scene, Shelly comes up behind Harry


                How's it going chef?


                Okay.

        Vada is seen turning her head to look at Harry and Shelly, 
        she doesn't like Harry and Shelly standing so close 
        together, she decides to make her move and pushes in between 
        Harry and Shelly


                Are they ready yet?


                No, sweetie, not yet.

        Shelly begins to brush Vada's hair with her fingers, which 
        Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off


                When?


                Soon honey, soon.

        Shelly again tries to fix up Vada's hair
                        (which there doesn't appear 
                        to be anything wrong with)
        And Vada shakes her off again


                When??


                In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll 
                burn your nose, look out.

        Vada backs off, followed by Shelly








                Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.


                I'll second that.


                Hey Shelly, like seafood?


                Uh huh, why?


                See food!

        Vada opens her mouth and displays half chewed BBQ cuisine 
        to Shelly


                        
                That's attractive.

        Shelly's glance moves to behind Grammoo on the other side 
        of the table and beyond, where the two men are standing 
        looking around


                        
                Oh shit! Excuse me...

        Shelly gets up and moves off to talk to the men, Vada and 
        Phil turn so they can see what is going on, Harry can 
        already see, Grammoo just sits staring into space


                Hey Shelly, who lives here?
                        
                The Addams Family?


                Danny, what are you doing here?


                What am I doing here????? What am I doing 
                here?


                         
                Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?


                You told everybody where you were going, I'm 
                here for the motor home.

        Scene shifts to Vada, Phil and Harry for a moment


                These two people do not have a good 
                relationship.


                        
                No! _I_ bought it, _I_ paid for it...

        Scene shifts back to close up of Shelly and Danny arguing


                I've been living in it for over a year, the 
                camper is mine.


                Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the 
                lawyer said, it's supposed to be "OUR MUTUAL 
                ASSET", not "Shelly's recreational vehicle". 
                Gimme the keys.


                Keep your voice down!


                What?


                The boss is watching us...


                        
                I'm impressed.


                God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.


                Yeah, all right...

        Shelly and Danny walk over to the table where the rest of 
        the family are seated, Ralph follows close behind


                        (Talking to Danny, pointing 
                        at the people respectively)
                This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada 
                Sultenfuss...


                Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.


                        
                I like my name.


                        
                This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino 
                Raphael salon in Detroit.
                        
                We used to be married.


                        
                Are you here to take Shelly back?

        Danny shakes his head at Vada, then Harry gets up and walks 
        round the table


                Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got 
                burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to 
                join us?


                Can't stay, I'm just here because my 
                wife.....

        Shelly quickly interjects


                Ex...ex, ex...


                My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my 
                camper.


                Shelly?


                Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I 
                promise.....


                I don't think so, I got a copy of the 
                property settlement right here.

        Danny pulls out a piece of paper

                Ahh Shit, this is my lease...... Damn it, I 
                keep forgetting things, I'm getting senile.


                Danny?





                Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, 
                and there's really nothing anyone can do to 
                comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the 
                times you had with the camper, the trips you 
                took, the sights you saw, those days are gone 
                now, but they'll live on in your heart 
                forever.


                        
                This guy bonking you?


                        
                Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!


                        
                Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.


                Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?


                It's her home! It's where she lives!!


                Oh really, okay fine look, go cook,
                        
                Gimme the goddam keys.

        Danny tries to grab the keys from Shelly


                Stop it! That hurts!!

        Harry is now VERY annoyed


                Danny.....

        As Harry says "Danny" for a second time he plants his fist 
        in Danny's stomach with force, winding him and shutting him 
        up








                What'd you do that for??


                Who are you?


                I'm his brother.


                Oh then you'll probably be visiting us here 
                quite often.





                Because if he ever tries to take Shelly's 
                camper again, I'm gonna bury him in my front 
                yard.

        Ralph looks rather disturbed by this




                        
                Your father is a savage.

        Vada looks up at Phil, Phil looks back and nods





                Bye Ralph.

        The car with Danny and Ralph in it pulls away and Shelly 
        waves


                        
                Well, you were pretty great!


                Is it really your camper?

        Shelly makes gesture with her right hand suggesting "sort 
        of"

        Suddenly a sky rocket screams up in the sky and then 
        explodes, Harry and Shelly look up and watch the fireworks


                Can we see it from the back yard?


                You can get the general idea...

        They move off to the back yard...


                Yep, there they are... They always look the 
                same every year...


        Pointing upwards Look...


                Did you ahh, love him?


                I would never marry anybody I didn't love.




                He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit 
                anyone in his life.


                He likes her.


                Does he love her?


                Probably.


                Do you like her?


                Yes I do, and I think she's very good for 
                your father.


                Why?


                After your mother died, he was sad all the 
                time, but before that, he was pretty funny.


                Really?


                Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he 
                seems like the old Harry.


                My Dad was funny?


                Well he wasn't one of the Marx brothers, but 
                he made me laugh.


                My Uncle fought in the Korean war, he had a 
                steel plate put in his head, Daddy said he 
                didn't come back the same, one night, he 
                picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his 
                teeth, it was really neat.





                Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.


                        
                Carnnk yu sheeee ik??

        Dr. Welty removes stick from Vada's mouth


                Can't you see it?


                No.


                It's there.


                Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your 
                throat.

        Vada looks at the Dr.'s certificates up on the wall


                Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?





                So you fill it with water like this, and what 
                have you got? A water gun.


                Cool, can I get one for Vada?


                Oh yes, yes.

        She gets another one out of her drawer

                Thomas, let me ask you a question. Does Vada 
                ever tell you why she comes down here so much?


                Cause she's dying.


                Do you think she is?


                No.


                Why do you think she says that?


                Cause she gets scared of all those dead 
                people in her house, and you know that saying, 
                If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if 
                she's one of them, she won't be as scared.


                You know what I think? I think Vada's very 
                lucky to have a friend like you.

        Nurse Randall hands Thomas J another syringe


                She's my best friend.

        The door to the doctor's surgery opens and Vada exits


                Miss Vada, how are you feeling?


                As good as can be expected.




                Hey Vada, guess what we got?


                What?

        Thomas J begins to run, and as he passes Vada he squirts 
        his syringe at Vada



                        



                        
                I'm gonna get you!!!
                        
                I'll get you!!!!

        Vada at this point is unarmed, and she chases Thomas J down 
        the stairs





        Suddenly Thomas J stops in his tracks


                Woah!!


                What?


        Pointing There's a beehive right there!


                So?


                Stand back.

        Thomas J stands a pace back behind a branch on the tree and 
        begins to squirt the beehive


                Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!


                You're right, let's knock it down.


                What do you want it for anyway?


                For their meat.

        The two start throwing rocks at the hive, which gets 
        damaged and eventually falls to the ground


                Got it!


                My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!

        They begin to search for Vada's mood ring

        Suddenly bees begin to swarm, luckily Thomas J notices in 
        time


                They're alive!! Run for your life!!!

        Vada just stands there looking, Thomas J comes back and 
        grabs her arm, this wakes her up and they begin to run


                Run faster they're after us!!


                I am running faster!!


                Hurry!!!

        They have run to the spot with the weeping willow and the 
        pier, they run out on to the pier


                Jump in the water!!


                But I have my clothes on!


                Do it!







                        (in the distance, from 
                        upstairs)
                Vada is that you?


                Yes..


                Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival 
                tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.

        Vada likes this news, she hurries up the stairs


                Shelly's coming with us.

        Vada is now not so happy






                So Vada, what's your favorite ride?


                I like the freak show.


                I know, I know, let's go on the "sit on the 
                bench and rest" ride.


                I don't think that that roller coaster agreed 
                with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have 
                to watch what you eat here, I remember one 
                time I went to a carnival with my cousins 
                David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, 
                and the next day they came down with 
                nephritis.


                Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't 
                get it from hot dogs.


                Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next 
                day they had really high fevers, and their 
                faces got very fat. They baffled medical 
                science, they were in a magazine.

        Vada and Harry give Shelly a "yeah RIGHT" look


                They were!! "Popular Mechanics", no "Popular 
                Science". I don't know, popular.





                Oh look they're trying to hit that poor 
                thing.


                Watch you don't knock out a fish.


                Perfect.


                I don't know which ball's mine.

        Vada gets a ball in a bowl


                I won, I won!!!


                Oh great!!


                Hooray, we have a winner,
                        (picks up fish in plastic 
                        bag)
                There you go little girl.
                        
                See how easy it is folks!

        Shelly inspects fish, holding it along with Vada


                Oh Vada, that's a gorgeous goldfish.

        Vada notices something on Shelly's hand


                Where'd you get that ring?

        All of a sudden Shelly looks up with a guilty look


                        
                Did you win it?

        Harry and Shelly exchange looks, Harry smiles, followed by 
        Shelly


                Vada we have something to tell you. Harry?

        Harry sits down on table and looks at Vada in a matter-of-
        fact way


                Vada we have some good news, Shelly and I are 
                getting married.

        Vada's expression begins to change from hopeful, to horror, 
        but then she drops her fish


                Oh my fish!!!

        Vada quickly bends over to pick up the fish


                We're having the wedding sometime near the 
                end of the summer.


        Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little 
        fish.


                Vada? Would you like us to get you another 
                goldfish?


                        
                NO!, He's fine.
                        
                Fish are very resilient animals you know. 
                Don't worry, I won't get another fish.

        Shelly and Harry exchange worried looks, Vada doesn't seem 
        to have understood








                Oh bumper cars, oh you can't go to a carnival 
                and not ride the bumper cars.


                I fall asleep at the wheel.


                        
                I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!


                Oh great Vada, come on...

        They run off leaving Harry to carry the teddy bear and the 
        fish


                        
                Uhh, two.
                        
                I got the blue one!!

        Vada runs in past Shelly and seats herself in a car





                Yes!!

        Shelly gets in the blue one


                        
                I am gonna get you.

        Vada straps herself in, Shelly turns around and gives Vada 
        the thumbs up, Vada looks VERY intent on brutally murdering 
        something now, and she returns the thumbs up, as she does 
        so, music begins to play and the power is turned on, the 
        song is "Bad Moon Rising"


                Vada, keep your hands on the wheel!!

        Vada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top 
        speed, so that Shelly's car is spun around a little, Shelly 
        screams, this is all in good fun, at the moment. Then Vada 
        rams her again, and again, and again, and again, and 
        eventually, Shelly does not look too pleased, she can't 
        escape Vada


                Careful Vada, careful.


                Shelly LOOK OUT!



        Shelly and Vada pull up along side each other, Vada gives 
        Shelly a satisfied but still spiteful grin




        Vada rings the Sennett's doorbell, and Mrs Sennett answers


                Hi Vada.


                Hi, can Thomas J come out?


                Sure, come in.

        Thomas J is coming down the stairs


                Hi Vada.


                Hi, wanna ride bikes?


                Sure.


                Ohh, did you make your bed?


                Yes.


                You're sure?


                It's made.


                Come here, you've got a milk mustache.

        Mrs. Sennett wipes Thomas J's lip


                Come on, let's go.


                Bye Mrs. Sennett.


                Bye Ma.


                Have fun kids.

        The two exit the house





                I'm running away.


                Where you running to?

        They get on their bikes and begin to ride off


                California, I'm going to Hollywood to live 
                with the Brady Bunch.


                I wanna live with them too.


                No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll 
                have to live with the Partridge Family.


                Really?




        Thomas J stops and then does Vada


                That's it.

        Thomas J goes and sits down on the river bank, Vada follows 
        with an annoyed look


                Get up!?


                I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past 
                this place two times already. We're not 
                getting nowhere.

        Vada sits down next to Thomas J


                Why are you running away?


                My Dad gave Shelly a ring.


                Wow, was it a decoder ring?


                You're such a retard, it was an engagement 
                ring.


                They're getting married?

        Vada nods her head


                So now you'll have a mother.


                I don't like her.


                I do, she's real funny.


                He likes her better than me.




                I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.


                Then go home, baby.


                I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.


                Leave then, some friend you are.


                You can come to my house for dinner?


                No, I'm hiding out.


                Okay, seeya.

        Thomas J climbs down from tree, and leaves






        Vada jumps down, and we can now see that the tree was on 
        the Sultenfuss' front lawn



        As soon as Vada has entered, she waits for someone to come 
        running and ask her if she's all right, where she's been, 
        they were so worried etc., Nothing happens, all she can hear 
        is the noise that the TV is making. So she opens the door 
        again and slams it. Still nothing. She decides to give up, 
        and go find Harry, she walks to the living room where the TV 
        is on, Harry and Grammoo are asleep in their chairs

        Vada begins to ascend the stairs, depressed


                In social studies we learned some people 
                stole the Limburg baby right out of his house, 
                I think i'll sleep with my window OPEN 
                tonight.









        Vada bursts out of the bathroom and screams down the stairs


                DADDY!! Daddy daddy!!!! Daddy!!??!?!

        Vada runs into a room where Shelly is


                Daddy??!?!?!


                Vada, Vada, what's the matter?


                Where's Daddy?


                Well he just left, what's wrong?


                I'm hemorrhaging.


                What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?


                        
                I don't want, I don't need your help....

        Vada tries to run away, but Shelly stops her


                Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?

        Vada nods her head


                How old are you?


                I'm eleven and a half.


                It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have 
                a little talk.

        They exit




                My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?


                It's actually a very beautiful thing, and 
                look there wouldn't have been a Vada.


                I think it should be outlawed.


                Believe me, some day, you'll feel 
                differently.

        Door bell is heard ringing


                Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna 
                see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to 
                boys.




                Hi Vada, can you come out?


                I dunno..


                Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go 
                swimming?

        Vada is angered by this, she comes storming out




        Vada pushed Thomas J hard enough to make him fall over, she 
        is angry

                Get outta here!! And don't come back for five 
                to seven days!!!

        Vada runs inside and slams the door, leaving poor Thomas J 
        sitting on the porch looking startled










                Grammoo, I'm going to the bathroom, i'll be 
                right back.

        She then gives Grammoo a little kiss, and makes her way out 
        of the living room to the bathroom, closing the door behind 
        her, as she goes to enter the bathroom she hears giggling 
        coming from the next room, so she goes to investigate. Harry 
        and Shelly are kissing and giggling. As she is watching 
        this, Grammoo gets up, enters the funeral room and makes her 
        way to the front, when she gets there, she picks up a rose, 
        takes a look at the dead man, and begins to sing into the 
        rose as if it were a microphone


                It's quarter to three, there's no-one in the 
                place, just you and me.

        As this is being sung, Vada hears and turns around with an 
        OH SHIT look on her face, Harry and Shelly also hear it 
        and make off for the funeral room, Vada quickly retreats 
        into the room where Harry and Shelly were, closing the door 
        behind her

                So santa-macho, I got a little story you 
                oughtta know, we're comin' my friend, to the 
                end of a brief episode, so make it one for my 
                baby and one more for the road.


                I'm so sorry, it's all right ma, I'm very 
                very sorry.





        Grabs Vada by the shoulders 
                Now what were you thinking, huh? HUH???? It's 
                your responsibility to watch her!! Do you have 
                any idea how upset those people are in 
                there???!

        Vada breaks free from Harry's grip, and walks briskly out 
        of the room. Shelly looks back at Harry expectantly





                Why do you think people want to get married?


                Well when you get older, you just have to.


                I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.


                You can't marry a teacher, it's against the 
                law.


                It is not.


                Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's 
                and it won't be fair.


                Not true.


                        
                Have you ever kissed anyone?


                Like they do on TV?


                Uh huh.


                No.


                Maybe we should, just to see what's the big 
                deal.


                But, I don't know how.


                Here, practice on your arm like this.

        Vada brings her forearm up to her mouth and starts to kiss 
        it, Thomas J follows


                Like this?


                Uh huh.
                        (they kiss their arms for a 
                        while)
                Okay, enough practice.


                Close your eyes.


                But then I won't be able to see anything.

        Vada raises her fist


                Just do it.


                Okay, okay.


                Okay on the count of three.




                One.


                Two.


                Two and a half.


                Three.

        Vada leans forward and kisses Thomas J on the lips, they 
        both look surprised, Vada then sits back against the tree, 
        long pause


                Say something it's too quiet.


                Umm, Ummmmm


                        
                Just, hurry.

        Thomas J stands up and begins to say something along the 
        lines of...


                On political agents to the flag of the United 
                States of America,

        Vada stands up and joins in


                And to the republic for which it stands, one 
                nation, under God, individual, with liberty 
                and justice for all.

        When they finish, they both still look a little 
        uncomfortable





                You better not tell anyone.


                You better not either.


                Well, let's spit on it.


                Okay.

        Both of them raise their hands to their mouths and spit on 
        them, they then shake hands and when finished wipe them off 
        on their trousers


                Seeya tomorrow.


                Okay, seeya.
                        (Vada starts off down the 
                        road)
                Vada?


                What?


                Would you think of me?


                For what?


                Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.

        Vada smiles, and gets on her bike


                I guess.

        As Vada rides off, Thomas J smiles




        Thomas J comes across the beehive, inspects it and then 
        kicks it, he waits and then once he is adamant that there is 
        no danger, he begins to search for Vada's mood ring, he 
        searches, and as he does so, bees begin to swarm, he finds 
        the mood ring, and by the time he notices that there are 
        bees everywhere, it is too late..


                        
                Yes!


                        
                Ow, ahh, NO!, Get away!!!

        We see Thomas J's glasses fall off onto the ground




        A policeman enters, takes his hat off and explains what has 
        happened to Thomas J to Harry, who becomes clearly very 
        distressed




                Hi Vada.


                Hi.


                What are you doing.


                Feeding my fish.


                Is that the fish you won at the carnival?


                Yes.


                He's getting big.
                        
                Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.

        Vada sits down next to her Dad


                Vada, something happened to Thomas J last 
                night, he stepped on a beehive.


                        
                I told him not to tease those bees. Did he 
                get stung?

        Harry nods


                Maybe I should go over and yell at him.


                No sweetheart, you can't.


                        
                Why not?


                He was allergic to bees.


                        
                He's okay isn't he?


                        
                There were just too many of 'em.

        When Vada hears this, her eyes begin to flood with tears 
        and the expression on her face changes movingly, it looks as 
        though she just lost the most special and important part of 
        her life. And she has




                Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??


                Vada, what's wrong sweetheart?


                I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.


                Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me look, 
                come up here and we'll have a look.

        Dr. Welty lifts Vada up onto bed


                It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.


                What Hurts Vada?


                The bee stings! I can't breathe!









        Knocks Vada?

        View shifts to inside Vada's bedroom, where she is curled 
        up in a little ball on her bed

                I'm leaving some food for you by the door, in 
                case you get hungry.

        Vada remains where she is, the doorbell rings




                Hi.


                Hi, is Vada home?


                Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's 
                not seeing anyone.


                Oh, I'm Judy, I go to school with her, I 
                wanted to tell her I'm sorry about Thomas J.


                Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of 
                days.


                Will you tell her I came by?


                Sure.


                Thank you. Bye.


                Bye.

        Shelly closes the door




                Hi Harry.


                Ahh, Reverand Miles.


                The Sennetts want to thank you for taking 
                care of things so quickly.







                        
                Vada? I see you took your tray in,

        Vada is looking out her blinds at all the black cars and 
        people dressed in black entering her house

                Maybe you should come down for the funeral, 
                sometimes it helps. Vada?





                She won't come out. It's been a whole day. 
                You have to do something Harry.


                The funeral's starting.

        Shelly is now very emotional


                Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her 
                only friend in the world is dead.


                I know that, but what do you want from me?


                Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I 
                first came here, the idea of working with dead 
                people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I 
                saw a family lived here, I thought, "if I'm 
                living without a family, at least I can work 
                with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be 
                invited in for supper."


                Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted 
                because there's a car crash, or there's a 
                fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.


                I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those 
                people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't 
                ignore the living, especially your daughter.

        Arthur enters


                Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister's about 
                to begin.


                Thank you Arthur.

        Shelly exits




                We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett. He 
                was born, May 7 1961, in Madison, 
                Pennsylvania, and he was survived by his 
                loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett......
                        




        The minister is heard to say this in the background


                The family has asked me to say a few words 
                before we proceed. No words that I could say, 
                would begin to describe the loss and grieving, 
                one word that keeps ringing in my ear is 
                Why?. Why would God choose to take this 
                little boy from us? I can't give you an answer 
                to that question, but I can tell you that God 
                has chosen Thomas J for some very special 
                reason, we must find solace in knowing that 
                Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face, 
                there is no sorrow such as....

        The ministers words fade into the very moving music





        Vada stops and sits on a step where she can look through 
        and see Thomas J lying in his coffin, she begins to cry





                ....disciples began to chastise them, and 
                Jesus said "Let the children come to me, do 
                not hinder them, for the Kingdom of God 
                belongs to such as these.
                        (the minister notices Vada 
                        coming around the front of the 
                        room)
                He laid his hands on their heads before he 
                left that place, let us pray in silence.

        Vada has made it right up to the coffin, which she leans 
        over and crying, says the following


                Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J?







                His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He 
                can't see without his glasses! Put his glasses 
                on!
                        (Harry and Shelly are rapidly 
                        approaching Vada, Shelly takes 
                        hold of her and tries to pull 
                        her away)
                Put on his glasses! He was gonna be an 
                acrobat.


                He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!


                Get away, get away!!

        Vada breaks away from Harry's grip and runs out of the 
        room, followed closely by Harry and Shelly





                Vada wait! Vada! Vada!!

        Harry stops running after Vada as she sprints off down the 
        road

        Vada arrives at Mr. Bixler's house


                Vada! I was just on my way to your house. Are 
                you all right? I'm so sorry about Thomas J.

        Vada covers her ears and begins to sing "doo-wah-diddy-
        diddy"


                Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, 
                Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, 
                it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?


                        
                Justin and Ronda say that I should tell 
                people what I feel.


                        
                Come here, sit down over here.

        The two of them sit down on Mr. Bixler's porch

        Vada is clearly in a lot of pain and she wants it to stop


                Mr. Bixler,
                        
                I love you.


                Oh, Vada...


                I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna 
                live here.


        Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss 
        you.


                No he wouldn't, I can't go home.

        A woman appears at Mr. Bixler's front door


                I'll be ready in a second, I just can't seem 
                to find my other earring....


                Suzanne, this is Vada.


                        (comes over to Vada and 
                        crouches)
                Vada, hi, I'm really sorry.


                Could you just give us a minute?


                Yeah.

        Suzanne goes back inside


                Who's that?


                That's Suzanne.
                        
                She and I are gonna be married this Fall.

        As soon as Vada hears this, she reacts, shaking her head 
        and backing off


                No....


                I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. 
                I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please 
                honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, 
                Vada sweetheart don't.....


                Get away from me!

        Vada runs off down the road




        Vada is climbing around in the tree, clearly trying to get 
        somewhere of significance


                Why do you think people wanna get married?


                When you get old, you just have to.

        Vada pulls out her photo of her mother


                Who's that with your Dad?


                It's my mother.


                I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
                        
                Vada, would you think of me? Well if you 
                don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.


                Now we're blood brothers for life.

        Vada gets out to the end of a branch, and makes a daring 
        jump to another, had she fallen she would be dead





                Shelly I'm sorry but we haven't found her 
                yet.


                It's dark, she can't be alone in the dark.


                We'll keep looking.


                We, no, we've been looking since this 
                morning, her teacher called, and he said that 
                she went there first.....


                I know, I know you told us.


                But I....

        Shelly is cut off as the door opens and in walks a very 
        shaken Vada


                Vada. Are you okay?
                        
                Oh God.

        Shelly embraces Vada





                I should have told Thomas J that he was my 
                best friend.


                I'm sure he knew.

        Shelly puts a nightie on Vada


                Shelly, I stole some money from your cookie 
                jar, to pay for the writing class.

        Shelly ponders this for a moment


                It's okay sweetheart.


                I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll 
                ever go to class again.


                I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first 
                book to me, and we'll forget about the whole 
                thing.


                I will I promise.


                Okay, get in to bed.

        Vada gets into bed and extends her arms to Shelly, they hug 
        each other, Vada has finally accepted Shelly


                Goodnight.


                Goodnight.

        Shelly exits and turns off the lights




                        
                She's in.



        Harry enters, walks over and kisses Vada, then turns around 
        and begins to exit


                Did I kill my mother?


                What??


                The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my 
                mother.


                No, no.

        Harry pulls up a chair and sits down next to Vada


                No sweetie that wasn't your fault, things 
                like that aren't anybody's fault, it just 
                happened.

        Vada pulls out the photo of Harry and Vada's Mom from under 
        her pillow


                I found this.


                I forgot about that picture, where did you 
                find it?


                In the garage.


                Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers 
                favorite car.


                What was my mama like?


                She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. 
                Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when 
                you laugh, you sound just like her.


                Really?


                Uh huh. You know what your mother did when 
                she found out she was gonna have you? She came 
                home and painted this whole room pink. She was 
                so sure she was gonna have a little girl.


                Do you miss her?


                Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and 
                even now, I get a little sad when I think of a 
                pretty flower or a sunset that your mother 
                would have liked.


                I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll 
                think of Thomas J.


                That's good, memories are good sweetheart. 
                Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from 
                you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and 
                I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump 
                like me.
                        (Vada puts the photo back 
                        under her pillow, Harry gets 
                        up and kisses her)
                Seeya in the morning.

        Harry begins to leave room


                Daddy, it's not so bad to be like you.




        Harry makes his way out of the cafe to talk to Mrs. Sennett


                Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?


                Some days I think i'll be okay, others, well 
                I have to force myself even to get out of bed, 
                I know it's crazy, but sometimes I think he's 
                just away at summer camp. How's Vada?


                Oh she's doing much better. Ahh she's just 
                inside.
                        



        Vada, who is inside talking to someone, hears and comes 
        outside


                Mrs. Sennett.
                        (she runs and gives her a 
                        hug)


                Vada. I've been wanting to come over to see 
                you,
                        (she reaches inside her purse 
                        and gets out something, it is 
                        Vada's mood ring)
                Thomas J had this on him, I thought you might 
                like to have it.

        Vada slides the ring onto her finger, the ring is BLUE

                You were such a good friend to him, I hope 
                you'll still come by and visit me.


                I will, I promise.

        Mrs. Sennett looks at Harry as if to say good-bye, and then 
        walks off slowly


                Mrs. Sennett.
                        (she stops and turns around 
                        to look at Vada)
                Thomas J will be all right, my mother will 
                take care of him.


                Thank you Vada.

        She then turns and walks off




                        
                Encased in talent, like a uniform, the rank 
                of every poet, is well known. They can amaze 
                us like a thunderstorm, or die so young, or 
                live for years alone. My advice to you on our 
                last class, be a thunderstorm.


                What exactly do you mean by that?


                I mean, be dangerous
                        (Vada enters the back of the 
                        room)
                And unpredictable. And make a lot of noise.

        Mr. Bixler sees Vada


                Vada.

        As Vada is noticed, she goes around getting hugged by 
        everyone


                Hey, we missed you man! Gimme a hug!

        Vada gives Justin a hug, she then proceeds towards Mr. 
        Bixler


                I was hoping you'd stop by today.

        Vada and Mr. Bixler hug each other


                I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.


                We'd love to hear it.


                Weeping willow with your tears running down, 
                Why do you always weep and frown, Is it 
                because he left you one day, Is it because he 
                could not stay, On your branches he would 
                swing, Do you long for the happiness that they 
                would bring, He found shelter in your shade, 
                He thought his laughter would never fade, 
                Weeping willow stop your tears, There is 
                something to calm your fears, You think death 
                as if you forever part, But I know he'll 
                always be in your heart.

        There is a long pause as it sinks in, everybody remains 
        silent, then just before the scene changes, the Temptations 
        song "My Girl" begins to play





                Hi Judy.


                Hi Vada.


                Things are a little better these days; I 
                finally swallowed that chicken bone, Judy and 
                I are gonna be in the same home room and the 
                republican party just re-nominated Mr. Nixon.

        Vada and Judy ride off down the road on their bikes, the 
        camera angle rises and the credits begin to roll as the song 
        My Girl plays
