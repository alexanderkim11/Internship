            leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip,
            "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..."
            "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If
            the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is
            fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, ?"  "In the
            Crisis."

            "appearance" of a war.


            I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of
            a war.

            Albania  no nuclear capacity.  Our spy satellites

            security of the country and the security of your Job,
            which would you pick.  And, while you hesitate, permit
            me to suggest that they are one and the same.  Your
            country and your job.


            I'm  my job, Mr. Brean.  That's what you see me

            To preserve their Way of Life.


            Would you go to War to do that?



            I have.


            Well, I have, too.  Would you do it ...?  In't
            that why you're here?  I guess .  N'if you go to war
            again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to
            fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and ?
            Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time
            has .  The War of the
            Future is .  It is and it will be
            against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst,
            perhaps, to their own , have blah blah blah.
            And to go to .  You
            have to be alert, and the  has to be alert.
            Cause that is the war of the , and if you're not
            gearing up, to fight  the axe will
            fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.

            "job security," or you can call it anything you like.
            But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect
            your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, 

            is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no

            Thank you, would you be seated, please.

            Ladies and Gentlemen... I thank.  A merciful God.  And
            I am sure each and every one of us will thank that
            Supreme Power, whatever we conceive that power to be --
            that peace is at hand.





            ...That peace is at hand...






            The threat of Nuc1ear Terrorism has been quelled.  We
            are in  with the Albanian Premier, who assures
            me, and this government  his assurances, that
            his country does not wish us ill, and  not.  That
            the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or
            of his making.




            of his making







            From whence did it come?  Our information states it
            came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed
            and Violent Dissidents...














             But that group has been, in the main, subdued.  Now:
             How did we come by this information?  And.  Who subdued
             that group?










            It falls to me to .

            To reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors.
            Men, yes, and , trained and pledged their
            , and, if called upon, their
            , in the service of their fellow Americans.
            A group so secret, its very existence has been known to
            just a few, and known not by a Name, but by a
            Designation Number, Three-Oh-Three...

            then, Enemy Lines.







            And I can only say, to those family members,  group
            303, which members are, I know, as I speak, gathering
            to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, I can
            only say,

            Having a good time.


            Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.






            Here's a photograph.  It is a photograph of a man.
            His name is William Schumann.  He is a Master Sergeant
            in the United States Army.  A member of the Squad
            303....dropped behind Albanian Lines.  We've just
            received this photograph, of Schumann in Captivity.
            Held by a dissident group of Albanian
            Terrorists...Now, I don't know how many of you are
            familiar with the Morse Code...but...could you bring
            the camera closer in here, please...?




            You will see his sweater is ...it has been
            unraveled in places, and those places form dashes and
            dots.





            Dashes and Dots.  And those dots spell out a message in
            the Morse Code.
            And that message is, "Courage, Mom..."


            And he got the message through. "Courage.  Mom..."

            Well, to the Family of William A. Schumann, to the Men
            and Women of Unit 303, to my fellow citizens  say
            "courage."  I have informed the Albanian government,
            and I inform , that we will not rest until the safe
            return of Sergeant Schwn&amp;nn.

            I'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "Old
            Shoe."  Ladies and Gentleman, we will not  him
            like an Old Shoe, we...





            Trump , Senator Nole, you Howdy-Doody-looking
            .






            ...we will 
            from  Old Shoe, our...





            Hey...?






            ...wasn't there a folksong called "Old Shoe?"  Wasn't
            there an old, uh ..."folksong"...














            It's all,  know ... thinking ahead.  Thinking
            Ahead.  That's what producing is.

            It's like being a piumber.


            Mmm...


            You do your job right, nobody should notice.


            Mmm.         


            S'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.

            Do you think we could line him up for the Peace Prize?


            Hey, our job ends at the Finish Line.


            Yes, but I, well,  know...


            Just for the Symmetry of the thing...?


            ...that's right.


            If they can give Kissenger the Peace Prize, I wouldn't
            be surprised to wake up and find I'd won the Preakness.


            Well, yes, but the guy  bring Peace.


            Yes, but there wasn't a War.


            All the greater accomplishment.








            "Volo," meaning, "I will."  As the President bends all
             will, to find, and to restore to his country, to
            his family, and to what are his mounting legion of
            friends, William Schumann, the Commando Ranger of
            detacment 3.0.3. -- Sgt. William Schumann...the Old

            ...and there's just one thing I'd like to say, and I am
            speaking to those in Albania who have the man in
            custody, and from the bottom of my heart:

            Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may
            rephrase, that the success of the President, in the
            Polls...

            But I'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  With
            the election one day off, and the President's standing
            in the polls...
