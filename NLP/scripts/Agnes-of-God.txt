                            AGNES OF GOD




Whispering of nuns at prayer.





Nuns at prayer; MOTHER MIRIAM, the Superior closes the gate and locks
it.





The nuns walking around the courtyard in an anticlockwise direction
saying the rosary.





A line of nuns kneeling at prayer. Closeups of various individuals.





A single shot of the building.



SISTER MARGUERITE is locking up for the night, shutting doors,
turning off lights, finally walks off down the corridor. Suddenly a
terrified scream is heard, the voice of a young woman.



Lights in the windows flick on.



The nuns    are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps,
calling    urgently in French. They reach the door of Sister Agnes' room
and try    the door. It is blocked. Pushing harder they see the blood
stained    figure of SISTER AGNES. Much alarm and crying...


                          Agnes!... Agnes...



An ambulance comes tearing down the road, siren blaring. It cuts the
siren and stops outside the convent gates. The nuns open the gate and
the ambulance drives inside.



Two PARAMEDICS urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the
unconscious figure of Sister Agnes. The Mother Superior desperately
wipes and kisses her face.


                         I'm just going to put something here to
                         stop the bleeding. Excuse me Sister.
                         She'll be fine.

They lift her on to the stretcher and run back down the hall.

The Mother Superior looks around worriedly and goes into...



She kneels down by a waste paper basket full of bloodied sheets and
starts to pull them out. Then she freezes, makes the sign of the
cross and starts to weep.





An aerial shot of the great cross of Montreal. Superimposed over this
are the words







A normal busy day. A car pulls up with a woman and a man driving. The
woman is MARTHA LIVINGSTON. She kisses the man , gets out of
the car, runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of
the courthouse. There a group of REPORTERS there and a sudden bustle
of interest.


                         Here they are now.

Martha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister
Marguerite, and Sister Agnes  and
their LAWYER come out of the court escorted by police. The reporters
leap on them, taking photographs, asking questions in English and
French. Suddenly Sister Agnes looks right at Martha, then she is
quickly bustled past. Martha goes on into the courthouse.



Inside EVE, LYON, and JUSTICE LEVEAU are sitting. Martha is standing
by the window smoking furiously.


                         Martha, it's you.


                       What about Roger? He's free.


                       They want a woman.


                       All you have to do is meet with her
                       once or twice... then tell the court
                       she's insane.


                       Are you dictating my position to me?
                       We're getting into some sticky legal
                       territories here.


                       Martha, all we're saying is, no-one wants
                       this to come to trial, not the Church, not
                       the Crown... least of all me.


                       Eve, she strangled a baby!


                       Nobody is interested in sending a nun
                       to prison.


                       We're not telling you what to decide
                       Martha. We're not even telling you to
                       take this.


                       Is there any reason why you feel you
                       shouldn't take it?

       Martha pauses for a long moment at the window, then turns.


                       Today's my birthday. I always make
                       bad decisions on my birthday.

The Judge, Eve and Lyon all chuckle. The Judge throws the file down
on his desk towards her.


                       Happy birthday.




        Martha unlocks the door and comes in. She plays her
answerphone
and moves over to her cat.



                       Hi, Kitty.

       The answerphone whirs...


                       Hi, it's Helen, calling to tell you
                       that Mrs Davenport phoned to confirm
                       her appointment at nine o'clock
                       tomorrow, okay? Bye bye.

       Some whirs and clicks.


                       Hi Martha,    it's Roger. Can you call
                       me at the    hospital. I'd like your opinion
                       on a case.    Oh, bye the way, happy
                       birthday.    Bye.


                       Hi, Marty it's Helen again. I cancelled
                       your Wednesday afternoon appointment
                       so you can visit with your mother. Bye bye.


                                


        Martha picks up a news paper with a photo of Sister Agnes on
the front.






        Martha pulls up in her BMW outside the convent walls and gets
out, cigarette
        in hand. A sign tangled over with creeper reads "Les Petites
Soeurs de Marie Madeleine". Martha jangles a bell. After a wait she
presses a buzzer. A   peephole in the door slams open and Sister
Marguerite looks out.


                       Bonjour, I'm Doctor Martha
                       Livingston, I...

        The peephole slams shut, but the door does open. Sister
Marguerite glares at her.

                                      MARTHA 
                       Hello... I'm Doctor Martha
                       Living...ston... I...

        Martha realizes it is the cigarette that is causing the
trouble
and hastily     grinds it underfoot.

                                         MARTHA 

                       Excuse me... I'm...

        Sister Marguerite eyes flick down at cigarette butt. Martha
awkwardly tries
        to kick it away.

                                      MARTHA 
                       ...the court-appointed psychiatrist.

        Sister Marguerite gives a frosty imitation of a smile and
motions for her to    come in.

                                      MARTHA 
                       Thank you. I um... I believe your
                       Mother Superior's expecting me.

       Martha and the Sister walk up the drive to the convent.




        Martha follows Sister Marguerite into a grilled waiting room.
Sister moves    off, leaving Martha looking around curiously. Then
the MOTHER MIRIAM arrives from behind the grilled door, sees
Martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving Martha a slight
start.


                               (beaming at her own
                                       little joke)
                       Doctor Livingston I presume? I'm
                       Mother Miriam Ruth. You needn't call
                       Mother if you don't wish.
                               
                       Most people find it uncomfortable.


                       Well... I...


                               
                       I'm afraid the word brings up the most
                       unpleasant connatations in this day and
                       age...


                       Yes... I...


                       You can call me Sister.


                       ... Thank you.


                       You must have tons of questions. You
                       may smoke if you want to. Just don't
                       tell any of the Sisters.

       Martha sits;   Mother Miriam gets her a box of matches.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM 
                       They wouldn't understand, especially
                       Sister Marguerite. She'd scare the pants
                       off Queen Elizabeth.
                                
                       Besides, I miss them.


                       You were a smoker?


                       Two packs a day.


                       I can beat that.


                       Unfiltered.

        Martha inclines her head impressed. Mother Miriam sits down
next to her.

                                       MOTHER MIRIAM 
                       Well, you have questions.
                               
                       Fire away...


                       Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?


                       No-one.


                       How did she hide it from the other nuns?


                       She undressed alone... she bathed alone.


                       Is that normal?


                       Yes.


                       How did she hide it during the day?


                               
                       She could have hidden a machine gun in
                       here if she had wanted to.


                       Didn't she have any physical examinations

                       in this time?


                       We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy
                       fell in between the doctor's visits.


                       Who was the father?


                       I haven't a clue.


                       What man had access to her?


                       None as far as I know.


                       Was there a priest?


                       Yes, but I...


                       What's his name?


                       Father Martineau, but I don't see him
                       as a candidate.


                       Could there have been anyone else?


                               
                       Obviously there was.


                       And you didn't try to find out who?


                               
                       Believe me, I've done everything possible
                       short of asking Agnes.


                       Why haven't you asked her?

        Mother Miriam removes a tray from under a pot plant and
brings
it back to
        use as an ashtray.


                               
                       She can't even remember the birth. Do
                       you think she'd admit to the conception?


                       Look, someone gave her the baby.


                       Yes, but that was some    ten months ago.
                       I fail to see that the    identity of that
                       somebody has anything    to do with this
                       trial.


                       Why do you think that?


                       Don't ask me those questions dear,
                       I'm not the patient.


                       Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's
                       going to decide what is, or is not
                       important here.


                       Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you
                       this politely, but I don't approve of you.
                       Not you personally...


                       The science of psychiatry.


                               
                       Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes
                       as speedily and as easily as possible.
                       She won't hold up under any sort of cross
                       examination.


                               
                       I am not with the Inquisition.


                       And I am not from the Middle Ages. I
                       know what you are! I don't want that
                       mind cut open.

       Then Mother Miriam walks out.




        A little later, Martha is sitting alone smoking. SISTER ANNE
enters and indicates that Martha should follow her. They exit out of
the grilled room
        and head up a steep flight of wooden stairs. Faintly the
voice
of a single
        young woman can be heard singing in Latin.



        Martha follows Sister Anne down the hall towards the singing.
They stop outside Agnes' room. Martha looks to see...




        ... Agnes an almost childlike young woman singing happily,
looking out the
        window. Then Agnes hears a slight sound and stops abruptly.
She
turns to see
        Martha standing in the doorway.


                         Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been
                         asked to talk to you. May I?


                         Yes.

        Martha moves further in the room. An ELDERLY NUN hovers
outside
the door.


                         You have a lovely voice.


                         No I don't.


                         I just heard you.


                         That wasn't me.


                         Was it Sister Marguerite?

         Agnes laughs and Martha closes the door, shutting out the old
nun.

                                        MARTHA 
                         You're very pretty Agnes.


                         No I'm not.


                         Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?


                         Let's talk about something else.


                 What would you like to talk about.


                 I don't know.


                 Anything... may I sit down?


                 Yes.

They both sit.


                 First thing that comes to your mind?


                 God!    But there's nothing to say about
                 God.


                 Second thing that comes to your mind.


                 Love.


                 Have you ever loved anyone?


                 Yes.


                 Who?


                 Everyone.


                 Well, who in particular?


                 Right now?


                 Uh huh.


                 I love you.


                         
                 Agnes, have you ever loved another
                 man... other than, Jesus Christ?


                 Yes.


               Who?


                       
               Oh, there are so many.


               Well do you love... do you love
               Father Martineau?


               Oh, yes!


               Do you think he loves you?


               Oh, I know he does.


               He's told you?


               No. But... when I look into his eyes,
               I can tell.


               You've been alone together?


               Yes.


               Often?


               At least once a week.


               And you like that?


               Oh, yes.


               Where do you meet?


                       
               In the confessional.

A slightly awkward pause.


               Agnes, do ever see Father Martineau
               outside the...

Agnes suddenly looks exasperated.


               You want to talk about the baby
               don't you?


               Would you like to talk about it?


               I never saw any baby... I think they
               made it up.


               Why should they?


               I don't know.


               Do you remember the night they said
               it came?


               No. I was sick.


               How were you sick?


               Something I ate.


               Did it hurt?


               Yes.


               Where?


               Down... there.


               And what did you do?


               I went to my room.


               And what happened?


               I got sicker.



And then what?


I fell asleep.


In the middle of all the pain?


Yes.


Where did the baby come from?


What baby?


The baby they made up.


From their heads...


Is that where they say it came
from... ?


No, they say it came from the waste
paper basket!


Where'd it come from before that?


From God.


After God... before the waste-paper
basket.


I... I don't understand.


Agnes, how are babies born?


Don't you know?


Yes I do,    but I want you to...


        
I don't understand what you're
talking about... you want to talk
about the baby... everybody wants

                       to talk about    the baby but... I
                       never saw the    baby so I can't talk
                       about the baby    because... I don't
                       believe in the    baby.


                       Then let's talk about something else...


                               
                       No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been
                       talking for weeks, nobody believes me
                       when I tell them anything... nobody
                       listens to me.


                               
                       Agnes...


                               
                       No... no, I don't want to answer any
                       more questions.


                       Would you like to ask them?


                               
                       What do you mean?


                       Just that... you ask and I'll answer.


                       Anything?


                               
                       Anything.




        The elderly nun looks out the window into the courtyard where
Martha and Agnes are walking, then pulls the curtain across.




       Martha and Agnes are walking together. Martha is smoking.


                       What's your real name?


                       Martha Louise Livingston.


                  Are you married?


                  No.


                  Would you like to be?


                  Not at the moment, no.


                  Do you have any children?


                  No.


                  Would you like some?


                  I can't have them any more.


                  Why not?


                          
                  I've stopped menstruating


                  Why do you smoke?


                  Does it bother you?


                  No questions.


                  Smoking is an    obsession with me.
                  Maybe one day    I'll become obsessed
                  with something    else, then I'll stop
                  smoking... Do    you have any more
                  questions?


                  One.


                  What?

They both halt.


                  Where do you think babies come from?


                       From their mothers and fathers of
                       course. Before that, I... I don't
                       know.


                       Well I think they come from... angel
                       lights on their mothers chest and
                       whispers into her ear. That makes good
                       babies start to grow. And bad babies
                       come from when a fallen angel squeezes
                       in down there, and they start to grow,
                       grow, till they come out down there.
                       I don't know where good babies come out.
                       And you can't tell the difference...
                       except bad babies cry a lot... and they
                       make their fathers go away... and their
                       mothers get very ill... die sometimes.

       Agnes sits down on a bench and Martha follows her.

                                       AGNES 
                       Mummy wasn't very happy when she died
                       ... and, I think she went to hell because
                       every time I see her she looks like she
                       just stepped out of a hot shower, and I...
                       I'm never sure if it's her, or the Lady who
                       tells me things! They fight over me all
                       the time.
                               
                       The Lady... I saw when I was ten. I was
                       lying on the grass, looking at the sun, and
                       the sun became a cloud, and the cloud
                       became, a Lady. And she told me she would
                       talk to me. And then... her feet began to
                       bleed and I saw there... there were holes
                       in her hands and in her side. And I tried to
                       catch the blood as it fell from the sky, but
                       I couldn't see any more because my eyes
                       hurt because there were big black spots in
                       front of them. And she tells me things like,
                       like... right now she's crying Marie! Marie!
                       ... but I don't know what that means.

        Martha stands up, disturbed. Agnes is slightly delirious with
happiness.

                                      AGNES 
                       ... and... she uses me to sing, it's as
                       if she's throwing a big hook through
                       the air and it catches me under my ribs
                       and tries to pull me up, and I... I can't
                       move because Mommy's holding my feet
                       and all I can do is sing in her voice...
                       it's the Lady's voice, God loves you!

       And her cry echoes all around and the doves fly out of the
bell

tower.

                                       AGNES 
                               
                       God loves you.


                       Do you know a Marie?


                       No... do you?


                       Why should I?


                       I don't know.




        Mother Miriam is standing checking some papers when Martha
enters. Mother Miriam seems to have entirely regained her good
humour.


                       Well... what do you think? Is she
                       totally bananas or merely slightly
                       off centre... or maybe she's perfectly
                       sane and just a very good liar.


                       What's your opinion?


                       I believe Agnes is different.


                       From other nuns...
                               
                       Yes I... I've noticed.


                       From other people!
                               
                       I believe she is not crazy, nor is she
                       lying.


                       How could she have a baby and know
                       nothing of sex or birth?


                       Because she's an innocent. She's a slate
                       that's hasn't been touched except by God.


                              

                       That's ridiculous...


                               (moves to her desk,
                                starts writing)
                       In her case it isn't. She's had very little
                       schooling. Her mother kept her home
                       almost all the time and when her mother
                       died Agnes came here, to us. She's never
                       been out there Doctor. She's never seen a
                       movie or a television show. She's never
                       even read a book.


                       If she's so innocent, how come she
                       murdered a child?


                       She didn't! This is manslaughter, not
                       murder. She didn't consciously kill that
                       baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was
                       unconscious by the time we got to her.


                       So, someone else could have done it.


                       No... not in the eyes of the police.


                       And in your eyes?


                       I've already told you what I thought.


                       That she was unconscious, yes! So
                       someone easily could have come in
                       the room and killed the...


                       You don't really believe something like
                       that happened do you?


                       It's possible isn't it?


                       Who?


                       One of the other nuns found out about
                       the baby and... and wanted to avoid a
                       scandal.

        Mother Miriam removes the tray from under a pot plant and
bangs
it down in front of Martha to act as an ashtray.


                          That's absurd!


                          That possibility never occurred to
                          you?


                          No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy.
                          No-one. Not even Agnes.




          Martha's car exits out of the convent and heads up the road.




          The car radio is playing light band music...


                          You have been listening to Mostly Music
                          from Montreal. This is CBC Radio.
                                  

          Martha flicks the radio off and stops the car. She thinks for
a
moment
          then...




        ... she turns the car around and heads back in the direction
she came.




        Martha drives in through an entrance and pulls up outside the
presbytery.




          From inside the house, Martha can be seen knocking on the
glass
fronted
          door.     Presently a huge, fat HOUSEKEEPER answers.


                          Is Father Martineau in please?


                                  



                                 


          The housekeeper indicates she should enter and walks back
inside.


                                 
                         Wipe your feet.

        They move into the next room. The housekeeper goes further
calling...


                         Pere Martineau...
                                 


        Martha stands uncertainly at the doorway. The sound of
thumping
is heard,
        and then the figure of a very old priest, FATHER MARTINEAU
appears walking
        with a stick.




        Father Martineau and Martha are having tea. He pours a slug
of
whisky from a   flask into her cup and an even larger slug into his
own.


                                 
                         They arise at five in the morning... and
                         they're in bed by nine at night. Even if a
                         man could get to them, he would probably
                         find them praying. That's why I see that
                         the real question is not only how he got in,
                         but when.


                         And you're the only man to see them?


                         I promise you Doctor, even if I had the
                         inclination, how could I possibly catch
                         her? She would have to be a very slow
                         and patient nun.
                                 
                         Ah no... they're a very special and rare
                         people those Sisters. Only a few of them
                         left in this modern world, consecrated to
                         the praise of God.



        An elderly WOMAN is sitting watching "Spiderman" on TV
cackling
with laughter. She is physically alright, but quite senile. Martha
enters, goes
        over to her and kisses her.


                       Hello, Mama
                               
                       ... brought you something.


                       Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.


                       It's your favourite...


                       Who are you?


                       It's Martha, Mama.
                               (hands over a tub
                                of icecream)
                       There you go.


                       Marie brings me icecream too you
                       know. Chocolate... my favourite.


                       I thought cherry-vanilla was your
                       favourite.


                       Not any more... now I like chocolate.


                               
                       Did you have a good week Mama. Are
                       they treating you all right?


                       You know Martha never comes to see me.
                       You watch it, she's going straight to
                       hell... after all the things she said to
                       me. Then she marries that son of a bitch
                       of a Frenchman... has an abortion. I
                       knew that one wouldn't work out. Not
                       like you Marie. You got married to God.


                               
                       Marie's dead Mama.


                       I remember when you    was a little girl
                       Marie. You come back    from the movies
                       and you'd say - Mama    that ending was so
                       sad... and I'd tell    you they had all the
                       happy endings locked    away in a vault in
                       Hollywood.
                               
                       And you believed me.


                       Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!


                               
                       Who are you?


                       I... I'm Martha, Mama.




        It is raining... distant thunder in the background. Martha is
standing under
        an umbrella talking to Sister Anne who is feeding the
chickens.


                       The convent was built for over fifty.
                       Not many of us left... just us and
                       the chickens.


                       How do you survive?


                       Oh, we own the land around here.
                       But we rent it out. We keep a few
                       acres for ourselves,
                               
                       some wheat, corn, some vegetables.


                       Well that's a lot of land. You must have
                       help. Do you have field hands that help
                       you?


                       No. We work the land alone. No-one but
                       Sister Marguerite and I are permitted
                       contact with the public.


                       Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?

        Sister Anne points up to a window on the corner of the
convent.


                          Oh that one there, in the corner.


                          The one up on the third floor?


                          Yes.


                          Uh huh.




        Mother Miriam unlocks a padlock on the door, opens it for
Martha. They both      enter the room which is totally plain,
stripped
of everything.


                          This convent is locked solid. The only
                          one that has a key is Sister Marguerite
                          and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.


                          Well, it's been known to happen in the
                          day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.


                          Oh come on, you've talked to her. She
                          doesn't even know how babies are born,
                          let alone made.


                          When did you first learn about her...
                          innocence, the way she thinks?


                          Shortly after she came to us.


                          And you weren't shocked?


                          I was appalled, just as you are now.


                          And what happened?


                          She stopped eating completely...




       In flashback:   Agnes, all in white is lying face down in the

sign of the
        cross in front of the altar. Mother Miriam enters.


                       This was before her pregnancy?


                       About two years before.

       Mother Miriam stops in front of Agnes.


                       Agnes, it has come to my attention
                       that you have stopped eating. Why
                       is this?

                               
                       I've been commanded by God.


                               
                       He talked to you Himself?


                       No.


                       Through someone else?


                       Yes.


                       Who?


                       I can't say.


                       Why?


                       She'd punish me.


                       One of the other Sisters?


                       No.


                       Who?

        Mother Miriam glances up at an older NUN who has been in the
chapel watching all along. She takes the hint and hobbles out.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM 
                       Why would she tell you to do this?

... Agnes look at me.


        
Because I'm getting fat.


Oh, for Heaven's sake.


I am, there's too much flesh on me.


Agnes...


I'm a blimp.


Why does it matter whether you're fat
or not...


Because...


... You needn't worry about being
attractive here.


I do, I have to be attractive to God.


He loves you the way you are.


No he doesn't. He hates fat people.


Who told you this?


It's a sin to be fat.


Why?


Look at the statues, they're thin.


Agnes...


That's because they're suffering...
suffering is beautiful, I want to be
beautiful.


               Who tells you these things?


               Christ said it in the Bible, he said -
               suffer the little children, I want to
               suffer like a little child.


                       
               That's not what he meant.


               I...    I am a little child but my body
               keeps    getting bigger and soon I... I
               won't    be able to fit in, I... I won't be
               able    to squeeze into Heaven.


               Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...

Agnes gets to her knees and pushes up her breasts.


               No... I mean... I mean look at these.
               I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.


               Oh my dear child.


                       
               God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll
               blow me up, that's what she said...


               Who?


               Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every
               day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay
               little it won't happen.


               Your mother tells you this?... Agnes
               your mother is dead.


               But she watches... she listens.


               Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I
               want you to eat.


               I'm not hungry.



                       You've got to eat something Agnes.


                       No I don't... the host is enough.


                       My dear, I don't think a communion wafer
                       has the recommended daily allowance of
                       anything.


                       Of God.


                               
                       Yes, of God.

        Then Mother Miriam looks down and is shocked to see Agnes'
white habit is spotted with blood, and more blood is dripping onto
the floor. She pulls out   Agnes' hand from her habit and gasps with
shock; there is a bleeding hole in
        the middle of her palm.


                       I'm being punished.


                       Why?


                       I don't know.


                       Dear Jesus...

               She quickly leads Agnes out of the chapel.


                       It started this morning and I can't
                       get it to stop.




       Back in the present, as before...


                       Why didn't you take her to a doctor?


                       It was healed by the following morning
                       and she started eating again...


                       She had a... a hole in the palm of her
                       hand! She could have bled to death.



                             But she didn't... did she. If anyone had
                             seen what I'd seen she'd be public
                             property... newspapermen, psychiatrists,
                             ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.


                             She has it now.


                             I know what you're thinking, she's a
                             hysteric pure and simple.


                             Not simple, no.


                             I saw it. Clean through the palm of
                             her hand. Do you think hysteria could
                             do that?


                             It's being doing it for centuries. She's
                             not unique, she's just another victim.


                             God's victim. That's her innocence.
                             She belongs to God.


                             And I intend to take her away from Him.
                             That's what you're afraid of isn't it?

          Martha walks out. Mother Miriam yanks the padlock out of the
door.


                             You bet I am.




        All the Sisters are present. Mother Miriam leads the chant in
Latin and the   rest of the nuns respond at intervals. Agnes is very
happy. Their singing continues over, until the end of scene 41.






        Martha and Larry are at the top of steps. He hands her an
envelope.


                             Here you are. Don't let anyone know
                             where you got them.



                                 
                         Thanks...






       Agnes is happily swinging on a long swing attached to a tree.






        The Sisters go about their tasks. Then all together they move
to a corner of the room which is laid out with burning candles and
make their devotions.






        Agnes is confessing to a rather disinterested Father
Martineau.


                         Last Tuesday, I didn't eat all of my
                         lima beans... hid them under my
                         spoon.


                         Yes...


                                 
                         I thought... thoughts... about...


                         Speak up, I can hardly hear you.


                                 
                         I thought ugly thoughts about Sister
                         Marguerite.






        Martha is leafing through a sheaf of police photographs of
the
sheets and
        the waste-paper basket. She puts the photos aside and puffs
thoughtfully on
        a cigarette.





         Agnes is milking the cow. She pours the milk into a large
churn.
         .




        The same four are in a meeting. This time they are all
sitting
except for
        Lyon who is standing by the window.


                        Would you tell me why the hell this
                        is taking so long.


                        Look there are a lot of unanswered
                        questions here.


                        Martha, your job is to diagnose, not to
                        heal and play detective. Who do you
                        think you are?


                        I know my job. Don't tell me my job Lyon.
                        My duty as a doctor is to...


                        Martha, you have to make a decision on
                        her sanity as quickly as possible and not
                        interfere with due process of law.


                        No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as
                        I see fit.


                        The longer you take to make a decision,
                        the more difficult it will be for us.


                        Why?


                        The bishop is breathing down our necks.


                        And the sooner she goes to prison, the
                        better off she'll be?


                              



                       I don't believe this. I don't bloody
                       believe this.


                       Well the bishop will be very upset
                       about this.


                       I'm fighting for this woman's life, not
                       some bloody bishop.




        It is a strange place; all the crosses are identical and very
simple. Martha
        is standing. Agnes is kneeling in front of a cross marked
with
the name
        "Soeur Marie Paul" and the dates she was born, consecrated
and
died. Agnes
        places some winter flowers on the grave.


                       You liked Sister Paul?


                       She was kind to me. She told me
                       I was beautiful.


                               
                       What else did she tell you?


                       She said all of God's angels would
                       want to sleep beside me if they could.
                       I liked that.

        Agnes makes the sign of the cross, they both stand and start
to
move off.

                                      AGNES 
                       She lived here for almost seventy
                       years. Every day she'd ring the bell,
                       wake us up, call us to God. She took
                       me to my secret place.


                       Where's that?... I promise I won't tell,
                       would you take me?

       So Agnes takes her.




        Martha and Agnes enter the bell-tower. Agnes leads the way up
the steep wooden steps. Martha becomes breathless almost
immediately.


                       Sister Paul was in her eighties?   Did
                       she climb up here often?


                       No, only when she felt like it. She
                       brought me up here last winter and
                       the next day she died.


                               
                       No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes
                       how do you feel about babies?


                       Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll
                       drop them. They have a soft spot on
                       their heads and if you drop them so
                       they land on their heads they become
                       stupid. I was dropped on my head,
                       that's why I don't understand things.


                       Like what?


                               
                       Numbers... you can spend your whole
                       life counting and never reach the end.


                               
                       I don't understand them either. Do
                       you suppose I was dropped on my head?


                       I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be
                       dropped on your head.


                       Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes
                       ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.




       Agnes climbs up through the trapdoor to the bell platform.


                       She said you could see the whole
                       world from up here. But it looks
                       much better far away than it looks
                       close up.

       Martha arrives exhausted.


                       Beautiful...

       Agnes lies down under the bell.


                       And sometimes I get under here...
                       it makes a wonderful sound.

        She starts to sing in a beautiful voice and the sound rings
in
the bell.


                       What happens if the bell rings and
                       you're under there?


                       Oh, it's even more wonderful then.

       Agnes sings a little more.


                       It's like hiding from my mother when
                       I was a little girl.


                       Where did you go?


                       Oh, no place as wonderful as this.
                       Agnes... have you ever thought of
                       leaving the convent for something
                       else?


                       No. There is nothing else. Just being
                       here at night helps me sleep.


                       You have trouble sleeping?


                       I get headaches. Mommy did too...
                       oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew
                       things that nobody else knew.


                       What things?


               She knew what was going to happen
               to me. That's why she hid me away.


               How did she know that?


               Somebody told her.


               Who?


               I don't know.


               Agnes...


               You'll laugh.


               I promise I won't laugh. Who told
               her?


               An angel, when she was having one
               of her headaches.


               Did your mother see angels often?


               No.


               Do you?


               No.


               Do you believe she really saw them?


                       
               No, but I can never tell her that.


               Why not?
                       
               Mmm?


               She'd get angry.

Martha moves round close to Agnes.


Agnes, did you love your mother?


Yes.


Did you ever want to be a mother
yourself?


I could never be a mother.


Why not?


Well I don't think I'm old enough and
besides I don't want to have a baby.


Why not?


Because I don't want one.


If you did want one, how'd you go
about getting one?


From someone who didn't want to
have a baby.


Like you?



        
No, not like me!


How would that person get one if
they didn't want one?


        
A mistake...


Agnes, how did your mother get you?


A mistake... it was a mistake...



                       Is that what she said?


                               
                       If you're trying to get me to say that
                       she was a bad woman and hated me and
                       didn't want me but that's not true, she
                       was a good woman, a saint...
                               


                       Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing
                       about sex...


                       I can't help it if I'm stupid.


                       ... that you don't remember getting
                       pregnant...


                       Not my fault.


                       ... and that you don't believe you
                       carried a child.


                       I was a mistake.


                       What the child?


                       Everything... I don't have children.


                       Agnes...

       Martha puts her arm out to Agnes who slaps it away.


                       Don't touch me like that! You don't
                       touch me like that, I know what you
                       want from me, you want to take God
                       away. You should be ashamed, they
                       should lock you up people like you.

        Agnes disappears down through the trapdoor. Martha throws her
cigarette away.




        Mother Miriam is comforting a tearful Agnes. She sees Martha
coming across   the courtyard and pushes Agnes gently away.


                       You hate us don't you?


                       What?


                       Nuns... you hate nuns.


                       I hate ignorance and stupidity.


                       The Catholic Church...


                       I haven't said anything against the
                       the Catholic Church.


                       Catholicism is not on trial here. I
                       want you to deal with Agnes without
                       any religious prejudice or you turn
                       this case over to someone else...


                       How dare you tell me to run my affairs!

       Mother Miriam starts to walk away, Martha angrily follows
her.


                       It's my affair too.


                       How dare you think I'm in a position
                       to be pressured...



                       I'm only interested...


                       ...    or bullied or what ever you're doing.
                       Who    the hell do you think you are? You
                       go    around here expecting applause for
                       the    way you treated this child.

        Martha and Mother Miriam are climbing the stairs. They pause
briefly.


                       She is not a child.


                       And she has a right to know that there's
                       a world out there filled with people who
                       don't believe in God...

                       
               ... and aren't any worse off than you
               Mother. People who've gone through
               their entire lives without bending their
               knees once, to anybody. And people who
               fall in love and have babies and occas-
               sionally are very happy. She has a right to
               know that. But you and your... your order
               and your Church have kept her ignorant...

They reach Mother Miriam's study.


               ???     


               ??? 
               ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty,
               chastity and ignorance is what you
               live by.


               I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married
               for twenty three years, two daughters.
               I even have grandchildren... surprised?
               It might please you to know that I was a
               failure as a wife and mother. My children
               won't even see me any more, that's their
               revenge. I think they tell their friends
               that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm
               making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
                       


               Then help her.


               I am...


               No, you're shielding her. Let her face
               the world.


               What good would it do. No matter what
               you decide it's either the... the prison
               or the nut house and the differences
               between them are pretty thin.


               There's another choice.


               What?


               Aquittal.


                       How?


                       Innocence. Legal innocence. I know
                       the judge would be happy for any
                       reason to throw this case out of court.

       A long pause. The tension between them dissolves.


                       All right, what do you need.


                       Answers.

       Martha holds her hand.




       Same place, but a little later. Martha is smoking.


                       When would Agnes have conceived the
                       child?


                       Oh, some time in January.


                       Do you remember anything unusual
                       happening at the time?


                       Earthquakes?


                       Visitors to the convent.


                       Nothing.


                       Do you have a... a diary or a day book?


                       Yes.


                       Take at look at it.

       Mother Miriam moves to her desk and opens the day book.


                       There's nothing here.



                       Was the child full term?


                               
                       Oh, Dear God...


                       What is it?


                       The sheets...


                       What sheets?


                       Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...





        In flashback: the sisters are sitting around the table at
dinner. SISTER GENEVIEVE, the other novice is serving them. Mother
Miriam folds up a linen    towel.


                       ... I should have suspected something.

       In flashback, Mother Miriam addresses Agnes.


                       Sister Marguerite says you have been
                       sleeping on a bare mattress Sister.
                       Is that true?


                       Yes Mother.


                       Why?


                       In the medieval days the nuns and monks
                       would sleep in their own coffins.

        Sister Marguerite gives a snort of derision. Mother Miriam
glances sharply
        at her, then turns back to Agnes.


                       We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.


                       It made them holy.


                       It made them uncomfortable. And if

                       they didn't sleep well I'm certain the
                       next day they were cranky as mules.
                       Sister where are your sheets?
                               
                       Do you really believe that sleeping on
                       a bare mattress is the equivalent of
                       sleeping in a coffin?


                       No.


                       Then tell me. Where are your sheets?


                       I burnt them.


                       Why?


                               
                       They were stained.


                       How many times have I burned into
                       your thick skull and the thick skull
                       of your fellow novice, that
                       menstruation is a perfectly natural
                       process and nothing to be ashamed of.


                       Yes, Mother.


                       Say it!

                                      AGNES and GENEVIEVE
                       It is a perfectly natural process and
                       nothing to be ashamed of.


                       Mean it!

        The two girls start to repeat it but Agnes starts to cry and
Genevieve
        falters into silence. Mother Miriam goes on more kindly.


                       A few years ago one of the Sisters came
                       to me in tears, asking for comfort,
                       comfort because she was too old to
                       have any children. Not that she wanted
                       to, but once a month she had been
                       reminded of that possibility.


                       It's not that... it's not that...


                       What do you mean?


                       It's not my time of month.


                       Should you see a doctor?


                       I don't know. I don't know what
                       happened Mother, I woke up... there
                       was blood on the sheets, but I don't
                       know what happened.
                               
                       I don't know what I did wrong, I don't
                       know and I should be punished.


                       For what?


                       I don't know... I don't know...


                       That was the beginning, the night of
                       the conception. That's why she burnt
                       the sheets.




        Still in flashback, Mother Miriam enters the room where

PAUL lies dying. Father Martineau is there and many of the other
nuns singing hymns.


                       When was that?


                       The twenty third of January. On that
                       night one of our elder nuns passed away.


                       Sister Paul?


                       Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was.
                       I was needed in the sick room.

        Father Martineau annoints the old woman. Then Agnes quietly
slips in   unobserved. Sister Paul rallies for a moment, tries to say
a single silent
        word to her. The smile slips from Agnes' face. Then Sister
Paul
lies back

       and dies.




        Martha and the MONSIGNOR are walking through the church
talking. He is quite young and has a rather abrasive manner.

                                      


                       No.


                       Well you're probably right about
                       that. It certainly can't help Sister
                       Agnes to have this investigation
                       continued for any length of time.


                       Why do you call it an investigation?
                       I never have.


                       Your mother was a resident of Saint
                       Catherines home before you moved
                       her.


                       What does this have to do with..?



                       And you had a sister who died in the
                       convent.


                       Who told you this?


                       Do you still go to church?


                       What business is it of yours..?


                       Oh, we just wonder if you can be very
                       objective about this case.


                       Look, Father, ah... just because I
                       don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs
                       you subscribe to...


                               
                       But what you believe makes no difference
                       to us whatsoever Doctor. But it does

                           make all the difference to Agnes.


                       I don't understand. Are you expecting me
                       to..?


                       Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor.
                       You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse
                       me.

       Martha stares at him as he walks away.




        A single shot of the back of the convent and the belltower.
The
bell is
ringing.




        Mother Miriam is ringing the bell and it takes quite a
considerable effort.




        Agnes has a wheelbarrow full of straw and manure. She dumps
it
on a pile.




       Martha is watching Agnes milking a cow.


                       Agnes, I'm here because I want to help
                       you.


                       I'm not sick.


                       But you're troubled... aren't you?


                       That's because you keep reminding me.
                       If you go away then I'll forget.


                       And you're unhappy.


                       Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't

                       you?


                       Agnes...


                       Answer me!    You never answer me.


                       Sometimes, yes.


                       Only you think    you're lucky because
                       you didn't have    a mother who said things
                       to you and did    things to you that maybe
                       weren't always    nice but that was because
                       of me, because    I was bad, not her.

       Agnes carries the milk pail round to the churn.


                       What did you do?


                       I'm always bad.


                       What did you do?


                       I breathed!

        Agnes falls to her knees. Martha moves round and kneels in
front of her.


                       Agnes. What did your mother do to
                       you?
                               
                       If you can't answer me, just shake
                       your head yes or no. Did... did she
                       hit you?
                               
                       Did she make you do something you
                       didn't want to?
                               
                       Did it make you feel uncomfortable
                       to do it?
                               
                       Did it embarrass you?
                               
                       Did it... did it hurt you?
                               
                       What did she make you you do?


                       No...


You can tell me.


I can't.


She's dead isn't she?


Yes.


She can't hurt you any more.


She can.


How?


She watches... she listens.


Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me.
I'll protect you from her.


She...


Yes?


... makes me...


Yes?


... take off my clothes and then...
she makes fun of me.


She tells you you're ugly?


Yes.


And that you're stupid?


Yes.


That you're a mistake?


She says my whole body's a mistake.


Why?


Because she says if I don't watch out
I'll have a baby.


How does she know that?


Her headaches.


Oh, yes.


And then...


What?


She touches me down there with a
cigarette.
        
Please Mommy, don't touch me like that
any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby
any more.


Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do
something. I want you to pretend that
I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time
I want you to tell me what you're feeling,
alright?


I'm afraid.


Please!    I want to help you. Let me help
you.


Alright.


Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!...
what do you say?


No I'm not.


                       Are you pretty?


                       Yes.


                       Agnes, you're stupid.


                       No I'm not.


                       Are you intelligent?


                               
                       Yes I am.


                       You're a mistake.


                               
                       I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I.
                       How can I be a mistake if I'm really
                       here. God doesn't make mistakes,
                       you're a mistake...

       Agnes is half shouting , half crying. Martha holds on to her.


                       Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's
                       alright, it's alright, it's alright,
                       I love you.


                       Do you really love me or are you just
                       saying that?


                       I really love you.


                       As much as Mother Miriam does?


                       As much as God loves you.




        Martha is in there by herself smoking. The elderly nun
appears
at the door.



                       I've been watching. We were fine 'till
                       she came. She brought the devil here.
                               (makes the sign
                               of the cross)
                       There was blood on her hand that night.


                       Agnes?
                                  (the nun shakes
                                  her head)
                       Who?     Mother Superior?


                       



                       What?


                       Look into the convent records.


                       Sister...

       But the nun has gone, walking quickly away down the corridor.




       Sister  enters to find Martha going through a cabinet.


                               
                       Oh, Good afternoon Sister, I... I'm
                       looking for some biographical data
                       on Sister Agnes, and Mother said I
                       might find it here.

        The Sister smiles, goes to another cabinet, extracts a file
and
hands it to
        her.


                       Thank you.

        The Sister nods and without a word leaves the room. Martha
waits until she has gone, then opens the cabinet and pulls out
another file. Glancing at the    door, she compares the two files.
They both have the same surname Burchetti. The the door opens and
Mother Miriam is standing there.



                       You lied to me



                       About what?


                               
                       Your niece!


                       I didn't tell you because I didn't
                       think it was important.


                       No, it just makes you doubly
               responsible doesn't it?


                       I never saw Agnes until she set foot
                       in this convent. My sister ran away
                       from home. We lost touch with her.
                       And when my husband died and I came
                       here, she wrote to me and asked me if
                       I would take care of Agnes in case
                       anything happened.


                       And Agnes' father?

       Mother Miriam turns out of the room. Martha goes after her.


                       It could have been any one of a dozen
                       men from what my sister told me.




       Continuing, just outside the record room.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM 
                       She was afraid that Agnes would
                       follow in her footsteps. She did
                       everything she could to prevent it.


                       Like keeping her home from school?


                       Yes.


                       Listening to angels?


                       She drank too much. That's what killed
                       her.


                       Do you know what she did to her?


                       I don't think I care to know.


                       She molested her!


                       Oh, dear God.


                       There is more here than meets the eye
                       isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.


                               
                       Oh God, if only I'd known.


                       Why didn't you? You knew she was
                       keeping her home from school. You
                       knew she was an alcoholic.


                       I knew that after the fact.


                       Why didn't you do anything to stop her?


                       Because I didn't know...
                               


                       Oh, God.






        Larry is interviewing a young PROSTITUTE in French. Martha
appears at the door.


                       Larry...


                       Marty, what are you doing here?


                       Larry there's got to be something
                       missing.


                       I gave you the pictures Marty, what
                       else do you want?



                       Something they... that they overlooked.


                       What? You think that the girl is
                       innocent?


                       I don't know.


                       You got to be crazy.

        Larry pulls out a pack of cigarettes, gives one to Martha and
to the
prostitute.


                       Larry...


                       What's the matter with you, you've
                       seen the reports. It's a cut and dried
                       case.


                       Maybe there's something that's not
                       in the report that should be.


                       You're too involved Marty.
                               
                       Jesus look at you. Why don't you
                       turn this case over to someone else?

       Larry lights his own cigarette and comes over to Martha.

                                      LARRY 
                       I'll ask around, see what I come up
                       with. In the meantime you go home
                       and get some sleep.


                       Thanks.
                                 


                               
                       If I find anything I'll call you.




        Martha takes off her coat, moves across the room turning on
lights. She
        flicks the answerphone on. Her cat meows.


                       Hi Marty, it's Helen. Mrs Davenport

                        called and was very upset that you'd
                        missed her appointment. She wants
                        you to call her at home, oh and a couple
                        of reporters have been trying to get a
                        hold of you about Sister Agnes. They
                        seem persistent and they may try to
                        reach you at home. I didn't give them
                        number.

       Some whirs and beeps. Martha goes into the bathroom.


                                
                        Hallo, Doctor Livingston. My name is
                        . I'm doing a Sunday article on
                        Sister Agnes for the Gazette. I would
                        appreciate it if you would give me a
                        phone call on 942-2424.

               More beeps and whirs. Martha starts to undress.


                        Hi Marty, it's me. Listen I just
                        talked with Detective Crawley who
                        was at the convent. She said that
                        there was one thing that bothered her
                        that didn't make it into the report.
                        The waste paper basket. The one in
                        Agnes' room.
                                (Martha freezes in the
                                middle of lighting up)
                        None of the other nuns had one. Bye.

       Martha rushes over to the answerphone and rewinds it.


                        ... her that didn't make it into the
                        report. The waste paper basket. The
                        one in Agnes' room. None of the other
                        nuns had one. Bye.

       Martha looks thoughtful and flicks off the desk lamp.




        Father Martineau is saying Mass. All the sisters are there
singing together.      Father Martineau places the host in the
sconce,
incences it and raises it
        up. Close on individual nuns at prayer including Agnes.






       Mother Miriam is kneeling in the doorway of the barn, praying

when Martha    enters. Mother Miriam pauses.


                       I've gotten the court's permission
                       to hypnotise her.

       Mother Miriam makes the sign of the cross and stands up.


                       And my permission?


                       I'd like yours too.

        Mother Miriam grabs a bucket and moves across the barn.
Martha
follows her.


                       We'll see about that.


                       Don't deny it!


                       I haven't decided yet.


                       The woman's health is at stake.


                       Her spiritual health.


                       I don't give a damn about her spiritual
                       health.


                       I know you don't.

       Mother Miriam starts shovelling grain into the bucket.


                       Sentence her and be done with it, that's
                       what you're saying and I...



                       I am saying  a beautifully
                       simple woman...


                       An unhappy woman...


                       She's happy with us and she could go
                       on being happy if she was left alone.


                       Then why did you call the police in the
                       first place Mother, huh?

                                      MARTHA 
                       Why didn't you just throw the baby into
                       the incinerator and be done with it.


                       Because I am a moral person.


                       Bullshit!


                       Bullshit yourself!


                       Catholic Church doesn't have a corner
                       on morality...


                       Who said anything about the Catholic
                       Church...


                       You just said...


                       What the hell has the Catholic Church
                       got to do with you?


                       Nothing...


                       What have we done to hurt you? And
                       don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic
                       a mile away. What did we do? Burn a
                       few heretics, sell some indulgences?
                       That was in the days when the Church
                       was a ruling body. We let governments
                       do those things today. So what did we
                       do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the
                       back seat of a car when you were fifteen
                       and you couldn't because it was a sin?

        This time it is Martha who walks away and Mother Miriam who
follows her.

                                      MOTHER MIRIAM 
                       So instead of questioning that one rule...


                               
                       It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but
                       it wasn't sex. You know when I was in
                       the first grade my best friend was run

                          over on the way to school, you know what
                          the nun said? She died because she hadn't
                          said her morning prayers.


                          Stupid woman... and that's all?


                          That's all? That's enough!   She was a
                          beautiful little girl.


                          And what has that to do with it?


                          I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one.
                          She died, why not me? I never said my
                          morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was
                          scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all
                          over my face, do you know what the nun
                          called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me
                          Polkadot Livingston.


                          So you left the Church because you had
                          freckles?


                          No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the
                          Church cause I had freckles.

       They both cannot help laughing at this absurdity.




        A couple of nuns walk across the courtyard. Another is
meditating alone. On
        a bench a nun kisses a dove and lets it fly away.




        It is out the back of the convent near the belltower. Mother
Miriam and
Martha are sitting there talking. Martha is smoking.


                          When I was a child I used to hear my
                          guardian angel. She sang to me 'till I
                          was six years old. That's when I stopped
                          listening. But I remember the voice. A
                          few years ago I looked at myself and saw
                          nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing.
                          Not even of Heaven. Not even of God. And
                          then one evening I saw Agnes standing by

                          her window, singing. And all my doubts about

                       myself and God were gone, in that one moment.
                       I recognized the voice. Please don't take it
                       away from me again Doctor Livingston. Those
                       years after six were very bleak.


                       My sister died in a convent. And it's her
                       voice I hear.
                               
                       Does my smoking bother you?


                       No, it reminds me.


                       Would you like one? Huh?


                       I'd love one.

        Martha hands her a cigarette and lights it for her. Mother
Miriam coughs a
        lot. Martha pats her on the back.


                       I'm out of prac...
                               
                       ... practice.
                               


                       All right?


                       Fine thanks...


                       Do you suppose the saints would have
                       smoked if tobacco had been popular
                       back then?


                       Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course
                       but, well Saint Thomas More...


                               
                       Long, thin and filtered.


                       Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and
                       stub them out on the soles of his bare
                       feet.
                               
                       And of course 


                       Hand rolled.


               Even Christ would partake socially.


               Saint Peter?


               Pipe!


               Right...


               Mary Magdelen?


                       
               Oh, you've come a long way baby.


               And Saint John would chew tobacco.

More laughter, then the moment because more serious.


               Right.
                       
               What do you suppose today's saints
               are smoking?


               There are no saints today. Good people
               yes, but extraordinarily good people...
               those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.


               Do you think they ever existed?


               Yes I do.


               Do you want to become one?


               Become?     One is born a saint.


               Well you can try, can't you, to be good?


               Yes, but goodness has very little to do
               with it. Not all the saints were good,
               in fact some of them were a little crazy.
               But... they were still attached to God.
               Agnes has that birth.
                       

                         No more... we're born, we live, we die.
                         No room for miracles.
                                 
                         Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.

       They start walking back to the convent.


                         Do you think Agnes is still attached to
                         God?


                         Listen to her singing.


                                 
                         I'd like to begin.


                         Begin what?


                         The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?


                         Would it stop you if I did?


                         No.

       They both halt.


                         May I be present?


                         Of course.


                         Then let's begin.




        The room is painted white and completely empty with a steeply
sloping    ceiling. Agnes is sitting on a chair with her eyes closed,
already under   hypnosis. Martha and Mother Miriam are facing her.


                         You're listening to a chorus of angels.
                         The music surrounds you like a...
                         warm and, comfortable pool of water.
                         And while you're sleeping, you're
                         going to be able to recall, all the things
                         that we want you to remember. And
                         when I count to three and clap my hands,
                         you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you
                         hear me.


                         Yes.


                         Who am I?


                         Doctor Livingston.


                         And why am I here?


                         To help me.


                         Good. Would you like to tell me why
                         you're here?


                         Because I'm in trouble.


                         What kind of trouble?
                                 
                         What kind of trouble Agnes?

          Martha starts to walk around behind Agnes.


                         I'm frightened.


                         Of what?


                         Of telling you.


                         But it's easy. It's just a breath with
                         sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?


                                 
                         I had a baby.

          Both Martha and Mother Miriam react with some degree of
relief.


                         How did you have a baby?


                         It came out of me.


                         Did you know what was going to come

out?


Yes.


Did you want it to come out?


No.


Why?


Because I was afraid.


Why were you afraid?


Because I wasn't worthy.


To be a mother?


Yes.


Why?


May I open my eyes now?


No not yet Agnes, very soon but not
yet. How did the baby get into you?


It grew.


What made it grow? Do you know?


Yes.


Would you like to tell me?


No.


Did anyone else know about the baby?



               I can't tell you that.


               Will she be angry?


               She made me promise not to.


               Who?     Who made you promise?
                          
               It's    alright Agnes. It's alright.
                          
               Let's    go to your room. It's the night
               about    six weeks ago when you were
               very    sick.


               I'm afraid.


               Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright.
               I want you to tell me what you did
               before you went to bed.


               I ate.


               Hm hmm. What did you have for
               dinner?


               Fish...
                       
               ... brussel sprouts.


               You don't like brussel sprouts?


               I hate them.

Martha and Mother Miriam can't help smiling.


               And then what happened?


               We went to chapel for vespers.


               Hm hmm.


               I left early because I wasn't feeling
               very well.

Suddenly Agnes leaps up from her chair.


               What is it?


               Someone's following me.


               Who?


               Sister Marguerite I think.


               Was it Sister Marguerite who knew
               about the baby?
                       
               Alright Agnes, I want you to see your
               room as you saw it on that night.

                               MARTHA 
               Open your eyes.
                       
               What do you see?


               My bed.


               What else?


               A crucifix.


               Above the bed? Any... anything else?
               What do you you see, something
               different? What is it?


                       
               A wastepaper basket.


               Do you know who put it there?


               No.


               What do you think it's there for?


               For me to get sick in.


               Are you ill?


                       Yes.


                       What do you feel?


                       I feel as if I've eaten glass.


                       What do you do?


                       I have to throw up...

       And she falls to her knees, retching horribly.

                                      AGNES 
                       I can't... glass... one of the sisters
                       has fed me glass.


                       Which one?


                       I don't know which one 


                       Of what?


                       Of me. Oh... God! My God...
                               (assumes the birth
                               position and looks
                               between her legs)
                       Water... it's all water...


                       Why isn't anyone coming?


                               (trying to wipe up
                               the water)
                       They can't hear me that's why.
                               
                       Oh God... I don't wanna...


                               
                       Stop her!

        Then Agnes tries to crawl away as though terrified of
something.


                       What is it?



Please get away from me...


Who?


Go away, I don't want you here.


Is someone in the room with you?


No... don't hit me please...


Stop this, she'll hurt herself
        
I'm not going to allow this.


        
NO... no... I said leave her alone.


       

You're trying to take my baby... trying
to take my baby... no...
        
It wasn't my fault Mommy... it was a
mistake Mommy.


Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two
three...
        (claps her hands;
        Agnes comes to)
It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston,
it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes,
thankyou. How do you feel?


Frightened.


Do you remember what just happened?


       
Yes.


That's good. Do you feel well enough
to stand?



                          Yes.

          Martha helps her to her feet. Agnes clings to her.


                          There you go. It's alright, it's alright,
                          it's all over. It's alright Agnes, that's
                          right, that's right.




          Martha approaches the building and enters it.




          The camera tracks through shelves of ancient records and
maps.

                                          MARTHA 
                          Ah excuse me. Hallo. I'm looking
                          for some ah... ground plans for the
                          ah... Saint Marie Madeleine Convent
                          in .

                                            MAN 
                                    

               Martha and a middle aged official come into view. He
stops
at a long set of        drawers and starts looking through it.


                                    



                                    


                  Oh... very interesting I guess...
                                 (he pulls out a
                                 folder of plans)
                  Excuse me...

        He sets the folder down on a table and starts going through
it.
They both
look at the plans.

                                          MAN 
                          Ah viola! This has everything. Even
                          the secret entrance. They all had
                          that. Usually to get from building to
                          building in the snow...
                                  (he indicates on
                                  the plan)

                          ... like that one.


                                  
                          That's how he got in... or she got
                          out.


                          Oh excuse me, what did you say?


                          Nothing. May I take some notes?


                          Oh yes, 

       Martha starts drawing a rough plan.




        The crypt is deserted but candles are burning in front of a
statue of Saint Michael. Martha walks over to it,lights a candle and
goes behind it and
        finds a stairway there leading underground. She goes down
into...




        Martha walks through the dimly lit passage. She stops for a
moment to look
        at a cross carved on the stone floor, then continues. Finally
she reaches
        more steps and goes up into the...




        Martha emerges through a trapdoor in to the barn which is
full
of doves. It    begins to make sense for her.




        Various closeups of famous statues. A bell is tolling. Two
nuns
come out of
        a building, down streets, across the road as though traffic
did
not exist
        and into another building.




       The nuns are Sister Anne and Mother Miriam. In the lift an


        checks her lipstick in the reflective metal walls. The lift
stops and the
        Sisters get off.




       They walk down the modern carpeted corridor into...




       Mother Miriam addresses the secretary, HELEN.


                       Is the Doctor in her office?


                       Ah, who shall I say is calling?


                               
                       General MacArthur.

       She heads onto Martha's office. Helen jumps up after her.


                       Just a minute please, you can't go in
                       there.

       Mother Miriam pushes the door open to reveal Martha.


                               
                       It's... it's alright Helen, just close
                       the door.

        Mother Miriam walks in and throws some papers down onto
Martha's desk.


                       I've just met with the bishop. We're
                       taking you off the case.


                               
                       You're what?


                       If we want to hire a psychiatrist for
                       Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
                               


                       One that will ask the questions you
                       want asked.


        
One that will approach this matter
with some objectivity and respect.


For the Church?


For Agnes.


You think she's a saint?


She's been touched by God, yes.


How? How? She hallucinates, stops
eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is
that supposed to convince me she
shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.


The father!


Who is he?


Why must he be anybody?


        
My God, you're as crazy as...


Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth,
I'm saying...


How  ?


Don't be ridiculous.


Well give me a reasonable explanation


A miracle is an event without an
explanation. If she's capable of putting
a hole in her hand without benefit of a
nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her
womb?


This is insane.


There as no man in the convent on that
night and no way for any man to get in
or out.


You're saying God did it?



No, that's as much as saying Father
Martineau did it. I'm saying God
permitted it.


But how did it happen?


You'll never find the answer for
everything God did.


I thought you didn't believe in miracles
today Mother?


But I want the opportunity to believe.
I want the choice to believe.


But what    you are choosing to believe
is a lie    because you won't face the fact
that she    was raped... or seduced...
or that    she did the seducing.


She is an innocent.


But she is not an enigma Mother.
Everything that Agnes has done is
explainable from modern psychiatry.
One, two, three, right down the line.


That's what you believe she is?     The
sum of her psychological parts?


That's what I have to believe...


Then why are you so obsessed with her?
You're losing sleep over her?
        
You're thinking about her all the time.
You're bent on saving her. Why?

       Martha has no answer.

                                        MOTHER MIRIAM 
                                
                        I'm not accusing. I'm recognizing.


                        There's a tunnel out of the crypt into
                        the barn. Did you know about that?
                        There's an answer Mother. That's how
                        she got out.


                        That's crazy. How could she find out
                        about it?


                        Somebody told her.


                        Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't
                        been used in fifty years.


                        Oh, would you stop lying Mother!


                        Why would I lie?


                        Because it's murder we're talking about.
                        Aren't you concerned about what she told
                        us about the other person in her room.


                        I'm concerned about her health.


                        Who was that person Mother?    Was it
                        you?


                        If you believe this is murder, it is the
                        Crown attorney you have to talk to, not
                        me. And definitely not Agnes.

       She goes out and slams the door.




        After a couple of establishing shots of the convent, the nuns
are shown ice   skating on the frozen pond. They are quite
uninhibited, like little
        children. Their singing  from the chapel continues until
the end of
        scene 78.



        Sister Genevieve, the other novice is being consecrated. She
approaches the altar all dressed in white, carrying a single candle
and kneels down.




        Martha and Justice Leveau come up the steps and into the
corridor.


                          All I want is one more week.


                          Why?
                                    (continues in French,
                                          then...)
                           You've done nothing to show any progress.


                          Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.


                          You're getting to all of us Martha, let's
                          face it.


                          I'll have a decision by next week.


                          It's gone on long enough. You're out.


                          Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.


                                  
                          You have proof?


                          I'll have it.


                          When?


                          Next week.



                                  
                          No, no, no...



                          I can get you new evidence next week.


                          No!


                          Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by
                          tomorrow. I will.

       They reach the door of Leveau's office. He thinks...


                          Yes, demain 




        The scene consists of a number of shots dissolving into one
another. Sister Genevieve lying face down in front of the bishop,
Genevieve praying on her   knees, her family  watching from
behind the grilled gate. Genevieve's
        hair being cut, her joy at the habit being fitted to her,
running out to
        join her family, a jolly old singalong on the piano, this
time
the nuns
        singing along from    behind the gate.




        Martha drives up in her car and walks across the now snow
covered grounds to    the convent.




        Mother Miriam is working away at her desk when a nun
interrupts. Singing   from the party can faintly be heard.

                                                 NUN 
                          Excuse me Mother, Doctor Livingston
                          is here.

        Mother Miriam nods tiredly and goes to meet Martha at he
door.
Martha hands    her a court order. Mother Miriam reads it briefly
and hands it back.


                          This is permission to take her apart.


                          Where is she?


                          Hasn't she had enough?


               I have a few more questions to ask her.


               My God, but you're determined.

They move back into the room.


               Who knew she was pregnant?


               Why do you insist upon pressing...


               Was it you?


               Is it because she's a nun?


               Did you know she was pregnant?


               Yes.


               And you didn't send her to a doctor.


               I didn't guess until it was too late.


               For what?     An abortion?


               Oh, don't be ridiculous.


               Too late for what?


               I don't know... too late to stop it.


               The baby?


               The scandal...


               You went to the room to help with
               the birth.


               She didn't want any help.



                       You wanted that child out of the way.


                       That's a lie.


                       You hid the wastepaper basket in her
                       room.


                       I didn't hide it. I put it there for the
                       blood and the dirty sheets.


                       And the baby.


                       No!


                       You tied the cord around its neck.


                       I wanted her to have it when no-one else
                       was around, they would have taken the
                       baby to a hospital and left it with them,
                       but it was such a difficult birth, there
                       was so much blood and I panicked.


                       Before or after you killed the child?


                       I left it with her and I went for help.


                       I doubt that's what she'd say.


                       Then she's a liar.




        It is the same as before, except that this time Martha and
Mother Miriam are      standing.


                       Agnes, can you hear me?


                       Yes.


                       I want you to remember if you can a
                       night last January. The night Sister
                       Paul died. Do you remember.

        There is a flash cut to Sister Paul being annointed. Agnes
stirs slightly.

                                      MARTHA 
                       What's the matter?

        There is another flash cut, this time of Sister Paul saying
that mysterious word that we could not previously understand.


                       She said Michael.


                       What did she mean?

        There is a third flash cut of the shrine of Saint Michael in
the crypt.


                       The statue. She had shown it to me
                       the day before.


                       And the passage to the barn?


                       Yes.


                       Why?


                       So I could go to him.


                       Who?


                       Him.


                       How did she know about him?


                       She'd seen him too.


                       Where?


                       From the belltower the day she before
                       she died.


                       So she sent you?


                       Yes.



        In flashback:    Agnes is walking alone through the tunnel
carrying an oil
        lamp.


                          What happened?

       Agnes keeps walking and finally goes up the steps into...




        Still in flashback, Agnes emerges into the barn. The doves
flap
about as
        Agnes    moves nervously through the barn.


                          He's here.




       Back to the present:


                          Are you frightened?


               Yes.




        In flashback: the doves continue to make flapping and
bumping
sounds as
        they fly around the barn.


                          Hallo...




       In the present:


                          ... where are you?




       In flashback:


                          Is it you?


        Then she seems to be talking to someone although we can see
nothing except the doves.

                                         AGNES 
                          I... I'm afraid... yes, yes I do...
                          why me?... wait, I want to see you.



                          What do you see?




       In the present:


                          Halos...




        In flashback: Agnes is still in the barn but now she is
lying
on her back.
        Still all we can see are doves flashing in the light.


                          ... dividing and dividing feathers and
                          starts, falling, falling into the iris of
                          God's eye. Oh... oh!... it's... it's so
                          lovely... it's so... blue... yellow...
                          blood wings, brown, blood...

       And she lifts up her hands.




        In the present: as she lifts up her hands, Agnes is
horrified
to see two
        holes in her palms weeping blood.


                          His blood... my God...

       Martha and Mother Miriam are equally shocked.


                          Oh Agnes...

       Agnes runs terrified over to the walls blood pouring over her

white habit.    Mother Miriam rushes after her.


                       It's bleeding... I'm bleeding...
                       my God it won't stop, I can't get it
                       to stop.
                               
                       Let go of me, I wish you were dead.


                               
                       Agnes... Agnes...

        Agnes breaks free and runs over to another wall smearing it
too
with blood.     Martha follows her.


                       Stay away from me...


                       Agnes it had nothing to do with the
                       hand of God. He did a terrible thing
                       to you, do you understand?


                       No...


                       He    frightened you and he hurt you. It's
                       not    your fault. It's his fault. Tell us
                       who    he is so we can find him. Stop
                       him    from doing this to other women.


                       Not your fault...


                       Agnes who did you see?


                       I hate him...


                       Of course you do. Who was it?


                       I hate him for what he did to me.


                       Yes.


                       For what he made me go through.


                       Who?


                       I hate him.


                       Agnes, who did this to you?

       Agnes flings her arms back against the wall.


                       God!  It was God.
                               
                       And now I'll burn in hell because I
                       hate him.


                       Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's
                       alright to hate him.


                       That's enough.


                       Agnes, what happened to the baby?


                               
                       She can't remember.


                       What happened to the baby?


                       It was dead.


                       It was alive wasn't it?


                       I don't remember.


                               
                       Oh, don't do this!


                       Wasn't it!




        Somehow this declaration seems to calm them down somewhat.
Mother Miriam   is looking utterly resigned.


                       Mother Miriam was with you wasn't
                       she?



                        Yes.


                        She took the baby in her arms?


                        Yes.


                        You saw it all didn't you?


                        Yes.


                        And then... what did she do?
                                
                        Agnes what did she do?


                        She... left me alone with that little
                        thing, and I looked at it, and I thought
                        this is a mistake. But it's my mistake,
                        not Mommy's. God's mistake.

                                        AGNES 
                        I thought I... I can save her.
                                
                        I can give her back to God.


                        What did you do?


                        I put her to sleep.


                        H... how?


                        I tied the cord around her neck...
                        wrapped her in the bloody sheets...
                        and stuffed her in the trash can.

        Mother Miriam gives a shuddering sigh, makes the sign of the
cross and
prays. Martha claps her hands lightly together once.




        A shaft of sunlight shines through the winter clouds onto the
city. Angle on the courthouse.




       All the main characters are present: Eve, Lyon, Martha,

Agnes,
Sister   Marguerite and Mother Miriam. Justice Leveau is summing
up.


                        In view of the situation as it now
                        stands, and the testimony given here
                        this morning, it seems quite clear
                        that the defendant was in no manner
                        responsible for her actions. It is
                        therefore the judgement of this court
                        that she be returned to the convent of
                        Marie Madeleine where she will be cared
                        for under proper medical supervision by
                        a visiting physician.

        Both Martha and Mother Miriam show relief at this. Justice
Leveau continues
        to sum up in French when suddenly Agnes stands up.


                                               LEVEAU 
                                
                        Oui. Do you have something to say?


                                
                        I stood in the window of my room
                        every night for a week. And one night
                        I heard the most beautiful voice
                        imaginable. And when I looked I saw
                        the moon shining down on him. For six
                        nights he sang to me, songs I'd never
                        heard. And on the seventh night he
                        opened his wings and lay on top of me.
                        All the while he sang -
                                
                        Charlie Sweet... Charlie Sweet...
                        Charlie's a...


                        Please, remove her from the court.

         Martha and Mother Miriam step forward uncertainly.


                        Would someone please remove the
                        defendant from the courtroom.
                                

         The nuns lead Agnes, still singing past Martha and out of the
court.






        It is full winter; many shots of the convent and surroundings
dissolving
        into one another.


                       I don't know the meaning behind the
                       song she sang. Perhaps it was a song
                       of seduction. And the father was a
                       fieldhand. Perhaps the song was simply
                       a lullaby that she remembered from many
                       years ago. And the father was hope and...
                       and love and desire. And a belief in
                        miracles.

        The nuns are seen walking together through the snow back to
the
convent over    which Agnes' singing can be heard.


                       I want to believe that she was blessed.
                       And I do miss her, and I hope that she's
                       left something, some little part of
                       herself with me. That would be miracle
                       enough wouldn't it?






        Where Agnes is singing her song among the doves. She stops
singing and the music fades in on the same key. Agnes gently takes
on of the doves and lets
        it fly away across the snowy landscape.
