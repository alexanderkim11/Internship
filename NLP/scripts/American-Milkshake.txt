          Jolie slams the locker door.
                         

                         
          Jolie is deep on the bench.
                         
          The acoustics are bad. The semi full bleachers fill the space
          with echoes.
                         
          The crowd is various shades of black. A lot of them have
          their feet kicked up.
                         
          Classic red versus blue.

          WENDEL, a guard, pulls up for a shot - swish.
                         
          The cheerleaders get excited.
                         
          The home score flashes red and reappears as 86 to 52. A blow
          out.
                         
          The team of Blair Blazers sit together, their heads moving in
          unison, following the action.
                         
          At the end of the bench are ARIUS and Jolie. ARIUS, covered
          in sweat, is a tall thin, care-free, light-skinned black kid.
          He has a huge scar on his head, a thick red headband and band-
          aids over his earrings.
                         
          Jolie is bone dry and still in his warm up suit.

                    Yeah. We were playing that joint at
                    my place and one of the
                    cheerleaders was all confessing how
                    cute she thinks you are.

          Jolie rips off his warm-ups in a panic. The shirt gets stuck
          over his head, then he trips over his pants.
                         
          His teammates look on with various expressions of concern and
          laughter.
                         
          A cheerleader from the opposing team points and giggles.

          Struggling, Jolie frees himself.
                         
          Coach Dale shakes his head and so does the fat black man
          directly behind him. Their expressions match exactly.
                         
          The old white referee blows his whistle hard - game over.
                         
          All the Blazers start high-fiving each other but Jolie.

          Jolie throws an African hat and tap shoes off his bed and
          they smash against the wall.

          Jolie pulls off his jersey and throws it down. He picks up a
          switch blade and looks at his warped reflection.
                         

                    He tried to put you in the game.

          There's a knock on the door.

          Elliott dunks and freezes in mid air.
                         
          He makes the sounds of a sold out crowd, animatedly, in a

          There voices fade into silence.
                         
          Jolie stands alone, grabs a dumb bell and does a few curls.
          He pushes it up his bicpt with his hand so that it looks
          bigger.

                    Wait. I want you to know... There's

                    only one I can trust, the only one
                    I can talk too. Like about when I
                    ran away, and let those kids take
                    photos of me. I couldn't tell

                    The thing is. He's not like other
                    guys. I mean, he's on the team, but
                    he's not really a cool kid. I've

          Jolie emerges from the school. Christine catches up to him.
                         

                    Jolie, aren't you headed to
                    computer class?
                         

                    What? Yeah.
                         

                    Is everything alright? You look
                    kind of stunned or something.
                         

                    What? No. I just. The sun was in my
                    eyes.
                         

                    Oh.
                         

                    What's up?

                         
                         

                    I am totally struggling with my
                    program this month, do you think I
                    could look at your code?
                         

                    My programming skills aren't that
                    good. But we can copy Haroon's code
                    and just change the variable names.
                         

                    Really?
                         

                    Yea.
                         

                    Cool. Thanks.
                         
          Christine gives Jolie a hug.
                         
          Henrietta walks past and gives Jolie an eye. Jolie pretends
          not to notice.
                         
          From afar the kids look like ants walking in lines to and
          from the portables .
                         
          A school bell rings.
                         
                         

                         
          Henrietta approaches the Redhead Grunge Kid. They're both
          skipping class.
                         

                    Hey, can I bum a cigarette?
                         

                    Aren't you pregnant?
                         

                    Whatever.
                         
          Henrietta rolls her eyes and starts to walk away.
                         

                    Hold up. Here.
                         

                    Thanks.
                         
          Henrietta lights up.

                         
                         

                    Fuck it, right?

                    Dude, Christine's been jocking your
                    nuts lately. What's up with that?
                         

                    I don't know man. I think she's
                    into me.
                         

                    She's probably just using you for
                    my code.
                         

                    It happens to me all the time.
                         

                    You wish.
                         

                    Even if she does like you dude,
                    you'd have to be loco to get with
                    her.
                         
          Jolie looks over at Christine on the other side of the
          classroom. Christine smiles back.
                         

                    Her last boyfriend Raymond -
                         

                         

                         
          Raymond, a cool Hispanic boy perched on a metal railing,
          cranes his head around and we see he's got a black eye and
          smokes a Camel.
                         


                    Has been having sex since junior
                    high.

                         
                         
          Ray hops off the railing, puts his arm around a girl and
          kicks over a trash can as they walk into the sunset.
                         

                         
                         

                         

                    That's nothing. Ray's been
                    suspended three times. They found a
                    gun in his locker. And he has no
                    blood parents. You don't want that
                    kind of sloppy seconds. It's big
                    trouble.
                         

                    Hmmm.
                         

                    You would be the man, though. I'd
                    give you that.
                         

                    Yea, that's true. You would be the
                    man.
                         

                    Why? What does that have to do with
                    anything?
                         
          All the boys roll there eyes.
                         
          IN SLOW MOTION Jolie turns to look at Christine, this time
          with his hoody up. Turning back he knocks his notebook off
          the table - papers scattering, a can of Sour Cream Pringles
          spilling.
                         
          Christine notices the commotion, laughs kindly. He smiles
          back.
                         

                         
          CRACK - the sound of softball being hit.
                         
          The girls team warming up.
                         
          Jolie and Christine sit on small metal bleachers.
                         

                    You guys have the late practice
                    today, huh?

                         
                         

                    Yeah.
                         

                    Well Coach Dale asked me to tape
                    the next game - you wanna see the
                    camera we're using? It's in the
                    small gym.
                         

                    Oh yeah. All the way past C hall.
                         

                    Come on. I know a short cut through
                    parenting class.
                         

                    Through parenting class? Let's just
                    go the long way.
                         

                    Come on. Don't be such a goody
                    goody. The teacher doesn't care.
                    Trust me. She's like a hundred
                    years old, she gets it. It's just
                    an excuse to have free baby sitters
                    for all the teen moms. And that's a
                    good thing.
                         
          She grabs his hand and leads him.
                         
                         

                         
          Jolie and Christine cut through the chaotic after school
          `class.'
                         
          Henrietta is there, looking bored, and playing with a toy
          toddler.
                         
          Henrietta gives Jolie a suspicious look.
                         
          Jolie waves nervously.
                         

                    Are you friends with her? That's
                    the girl I was telling you about.
                         

                    I just tutor her in Algebra. You
                    know how we need community service
                    hours to graduate, well...

                         
                         

                         
          A mural of fire emblazons the walls.
                         
          A second floor balcony - overlooking the court. A space for
          storing of moldy old trampolines and gymnastic junk.
                         

                    It's hot as a mug in here.
                         
          Christine flips on a giant standing fan.
                         

                    Stand in front of this. God that
                    feels good.
                         
          Her hair and cheerleader skirt blowing back. Jolie stands
          next to her.
                         
          Christine gracefully gets on her knees. Beat.
                         

                    The camera's under here. Come on.
                         
          She crawls under the trampoline, through the glittery tassels
          hanging around it's edges.
                         
          Jolie hesitates then follows but we stay behind. A pom-pom
          and a basketball rest in the foreground.
                         


                    The season hadn't even started and
                    my life had changed forever.
                         
          Just below the tassels Christine's top lands on the floor.
                         


                    I swear, exactly when we kissed
                    someone yelled score.
                         
          Kids of all shapes and sizes rush the court below with hockey
          sticks. Haroon and Vlad and Benjamin and Anya, and the
          Redhead Grunge Kid and Ray among them.
                         

                    Score! Score! Score!
                         

                    Shut your hole!

                         
                         


                       It felt like a million bucks.
                         
          Haroon pumps his fist yes as someone gets a shot past the
          goalie in warm ups.
                         
          Christine fixes her hair and walks out with a VHS camcorder.
                         


                       I felt guilty cuz of Henrietta, but
                       as Tu Pac says, "Only God can judge
                       me."
                         
          Jolie stands behind, in the doorway, fixing his belt and
          getting a touch of wind from the fan.
                         


                       I did wonder if Henrietta's Dad,
                       Mr. Aaronson, even knew she was
                       pregnant.
                         
          Jolie takes a last glimpse of the intermural floor hockey
          game below them.
                         


                       But for some reason it just never
                       came up.
                         
          Jolie ducks into the stairwell.
                         
          Then all the lights go out.
                         
          Blackness.
                         
          Hold.
                         
          Haroon walks into a small shaft of light that goes unseen
          until it has his face to land on.
                         


                       Would someone please stop messing
                       around and put the lights on. This
                       league is for serious players only.
                         
          Haroon puts on his RoboCop goalie mask. BAM! He is body
          checked to the floor.
                         

                       Boom! Step aside, nigga.

                         
                         
          Haroon slouched against the wall - blood dripping from his
          temple.

                    Tell your boy Jolie to lay off my

                    ass for lunch.

          Haroon, and Haroon's older brother ZEKE are rummaging the
          kitchen cabinets for snacks. Haroon's arm is in a cast for
          the rest of the movie.
                         

                    Hey, are there anymore Handi-Snacks

          Haroon rolls his eyes and shakes his head.
                         

                    The whole nine? It's a movie.
                         

                    It's an Ice Tea flick and it's
                    gonna be tight as a mug.
                         
          Haroon looks disgusted and offended.

                    We had an early game today against
                    Paint Branch. And I scored 3
                    points.

                         
                         

                    You know I saw you with that
                    Cheerleader.
                         

                    Come on. Enough with that. I washed
                    my hands already. So I can please
                    you.
                         

                    Just tell me yall are hooking up.
                    It's OK if you are. I just want the
                    truth.
                         

                    You want the truth. How is this?
                         
          Jolie reveals a plastic case meant for baseball cards. Out of
          it he slides a small newspaper cut out.
                         
          A picture of Francisco getting arrested with the headline
          `Sex Video Arrest.'
                         


                    Yeah. Francisco got arrested. What
                    about it?
                         

                    I thought you said you didn't fuck
                    any of them.
                         

                    I didn't.
                         

                    Did you suck their dicks?
                         

                    Jolie. It's none of your fucking
                    business.
                         

                    Well everyone at school says you
                    did. And now they're saying there's
                    a video and that's why Francisco
                    and Merly got arrested.
                         

                    They're not arrested. They got
                    questioned and shit and then they
                    got suspended.

                         
                         

                    How do you know?
                         

                    Because I hear all the Maple Ave
                    stuff.
                         
          Haroon pretends to watch the movie but is obviously
          uncomfortable.
                         

                    Shhh. It's getting good you know.
                         
          Henrietta and Jolie whisper more quietly.
                         

                    Look, that's all beside the point.
                    Whatever you heard about me at
                    school, they don't know shit. It's
                    a lie. I already told you. I ran
                    away from home. That's it. Now
                    leave me alone.
                         

                    Why did you let them take pictures?
                         

                    I told you. I needed money.
                         

                    For what?
                         

                    Duh, an abortion. Does that make
                    you feel better. But I decided I
                    want this baby Jolie. I want a real
                    family. So I went to Pizza Hut for
                    dinner instead. The one on
                    University Boulevard, do you want a
                    receipt or something?
                         

                    Where did you sleep that night?
                         

                    I told you. I slept at the ATM
                    machine. Now stop it.
                         
          Henrietta is on the verge of tears and it cracks Jolie.
                         

                    Dang. I know. I'm sorry. I'm such
                    an idiot.

                         
                         

                       But I love you. I just want to be
                       with you now. And put all that in
                       the past.
                         

                       Why didn't you come to me then?
                         

                       We had just met.
                         

                       I know. Damn it. You could have
                       slept on my couch, easy. My parents
                       wouldn't have even cared.
                         
          We hear a killing on the screen.
                         
          They kiss.
                         
          The color cast on them shifts from a blue to a red. Jolie
          reaches under the starter jacket that lies across her lap.
                         

                       Jolie. No.
                         

                       You lied to me.
                         

                       I didn't. I would never.
                         

                       How do I know?
                         
          Henrietta guides his hand up between her legs and she closes
          her eyes, succumbing to his fingers.
                         

                       Don't you trust me?
                         
          From behind them they are silhouettes against the Ice-T
          action pic "Surviving the Game."
                         
          A baby is crying somewhere in the theater.
                         
          The red light cast on them begins to flash rapidly. In and
          out of blackness.
                         
          Jolie peaks at a boy one seat away. (Jolie's basketball is in
          the seat between them, with Haroon's Batman toy sitting atop
          it.)
                         
          Henrietta breathes hard.

                         
                         
          Jolie bites his lower lip.

                    I would but I can't. This is like
                    the biggest project of the year.
                         

                    I have a huge test tomorrow and if

                    want any doesn't mean Jolie
                    doesn't. Tutoring is hard work,
                    after all.

                    I tutored high school kids in

          Henrietta looks bummed. She cups her stomach and looks at it.

          Wendel wipes sweat off his chin.
                         
          Coach Dale eyes them down. Two dishevelled white assistant

          hangs around, an unofficial assistant coach.
                         
          ASSISTANT #1 wears a gray sweat suit. ASSISTANT #2 sports a

                    thinking too much on the court.

                    have a chance of beating
                    Springbrook without Francisco and
                    Merly. We're short handed,
                    especially at guard positions, so
                    everyone has to be ready to play,
                    especially you Jolie. You're as
                    good as anybody on this team. I've

                    scrimmaged with JV.

                    How did World War 2 escalate? It
                    just did. Someone pulled out his
                    junk teasing her, and then she
                    started messing around with her
                    tongue on his balls, just laughing
                    and stuff. And it just went from

          Jolie looks devastated. The picture in a backwards blur -
          rewinding, we can make out Henrietta.
                         

                    Shhhhhh. Shhhhh. This is it.

                    specimen.
                         
          Everyone laughs but Jolie.

          The kids in the room break out into ad-lib excitement.
                         

                    Pause it. Pause it. Pause it. Look.

          In the background of the video is a doorway to a hallway, and
          crouched on the floor as if waiting for a long time, is
          Francisco.
                         

                    Coach Dale is coming. I'm serious.
                    He's coming now.
                         
          Wendel flips on the Sega Genesis. John Madden '95 appears on
          the screen.
                         
          Christine and Wendel each grab a controller.
                         
          Coach Dale enters.
                         

                    No weightroom today guys, we got
                    some studying to do. This is a copy
                    of last years Springbrook game. Get
                    comfortable, this could be a while.
                         
          The cheerleaders gather themselves.

                         
                         
          Coach Dale tries to insert the game tape but the VHS of
          Henrietta is still inside. He ejects the mystery tape, looks
          at it, unlabeled, and puts it in his bag.
                         

                        
                    Girls, you are welcome to watch but

                    work cut out for us.
                         
          The cheerleaders leave, Christine the last to straggle along,
          grabs Jolie's hand briefly on the way out.
                         
          Coach Dale turn off the lights and presses play on the game
          tape.
                         
          Arius considers swiping the VHS. So does Jolie. But there's
          no opportunity.
                         
          The low quality recording of a game plays: one pixilated,
          long take.
                         
          The blue team scores. The white team - THE BLAZERS - in-bound
          the ball, and the camera pans following the action. The video
          as primitive as it gets.
                         
          Jolie is in a daze about what has seen with Henrietta.
                         
          Coach Dale pauses the tape.
                         

                    Now what was wrong with that shot?

                    Jolie?
                         

                    He shot on the first pass of a half
                    court set.

                    Do I look like white to you?
                         
          Beat.
                         
          Coach Dale assails Arius, wrestling him into a hold on the
          floor.
                         

                    How does it feel?

                         
                         

                    Owwww. My arm.
                         
          The other players stand back feeling awkward about the semi-
          abusive coach.
                         

                    How does it feel?
                         

                    Ah. Ah. Ah.
                         

                    Look in my eyes. How does it feel?
                         

                    Ahhhhhh!
                         

                    If I ever see you back away from a
                    rebound again I'm gonna bench you
                    for the season. You wont play one
                    second the whole year. You got that
                    boy?
                         
          Arius pinned and cringing squirms, eyes tearing, shirt
          bunching up and revealing a tatoo on his back for "Maple
          Ave."
                         
          While everyone's distracted Jolie eyes the bag with the VHS,
          inching closer. Just as he's about to make his move the coach
          release Arius and sits back down.
                         
          Then he pounces on Arius again and Jolie quickly grab the
          tape.
                         

                    Ahhhhh!
                         

                         
          Rain pours.
                         
          Jolie sits on a stump, drenched and pounding a can of Coca-
          Cola and holding a basketball.
                         
          Henrietta comes timidly down the path with an umbrella and
          flashlight, removing her Walkman headphones.
                         

                    Jolie, you are soaking wet. What's
                    going on? Why did you want to meet
                    here in the middle of the night?

                         
                         

                     This. This tape is going on. I saw
                     it. The whole team saw it.
                         
          Henrietta is silent.
                         

                     You lied to me. Why?
                         
          Jolie puts the VHS on the stump and smashes it violently with
          his basketball. Then he pulls the tape out of the VHS
          cassette and throws it into the air dramatically.
                         

                     Don't you have anything to say?!

                     How could I tell you when you never
                     listen?
                         

                     Why? Why not? I love you.
                         
          Jolie hugs her.
                         

                     Sometimes love is not enough.
                         
          Jolie just looks at her.
                         
          Jolie is dumb struck.
                         
          Henrietta hugs him.
                         

                     I just couldn't tell you about
                     Maple Ave., Jolie. I just couldn't
                     let you down. Your a Magnet kid.
                     Your smart. Your excellent at

          Henrietta hides her face in his shoulder.
                         

                    I think we shouldn't see each other

          A beautiful silhouette kiss against the dark blue sky in the
          rain. Jolie's basketball in a glistening puddle. Magnetic
          tape from the VHS strewn about.
                         

                    I never meant any of that to
                    happen. Things just got out of

          throws them in the trash together.
                         
          Then he pulls out an All Eyes on Me CD. We get a long close

                    days I would just look around and
                    soak it in. I couldn't believe I

          Arius contemplates breaking the lock. He sips the last of his
          huge soda, the cup still heavy from ice, and launches it over
          a few parked cars. It crashes loudly in a dumpster.

          Arius walks away toward the rack.
                         
          He yanks the new shiny green mountain bike with two arms up
          toward his chest. The entire bike rack jerks off the ground
          but the lock doesn't break.
                         
          Arius walks on like nothing has happened. Disappears among
          the parked cars - the sun setting behind them.
                         

                         
          A large entrance-way with drop ceilings, a black floor, and
          red trim.
                         
          The Blazers Emblem is mounted high. A giant copper shield
          divided into four, like something out of a gladiator movie.
                         
          It's lunch period and kids from the team are hanging out.
          Jolie, Haroon, Vlad and Christine are nearby.
                         


                    Jolie. I have to tell you
                    something. Wanna go outside for a
                    sec?
                         

                        
                    Sure.
                         
          Ray, walking past, intentionally brushes Haroon with his
          shoulder. Haroon drops his Handisnacks - his crackers
          crumbling across the floor.
                         

                    Dead man.
                         

                    You're not gonna do shit.
                         

                    This aint about you.

                    Fuck you.
                         

                    You're just rude. That's why your
                    Mom beat your ass growing up.
                         

                    Keep talking about my Mom nigga.
                    I'll smash your fucking nigga lips
                    in.
                         
          In a flash Arius wrenches Ray by the collar, swings him
          around into the tall windows and they slam into them.
                         

                    Say it again.
                         
          Ray throws a punch and a fight breaks out. Kids come running
          to watch from different classrooms.
                         
          Arius gets Ray by the collar again and swing him around into
          the window but this time they fall through the glass.
                         
          Ray lands on his back outside. Arius falls forward hanging
          half out of the window and glass punctures his gut.
                         

                    My fucking gut. I'm bleeding all
                    over my fucking Guess. My Guess
                    shit man!
                         

                    Ah fuck man. I'm OK. I think I'm

                         
          A large crowd has gathered around the blood and broken window
          in the aftermath of a fight.
                         

                    Ah shit, man! Ahhh! My fucking gut
                    is burning!
                         

                    Holly shit. You need help. Someone
                    call an ambulance.
                         

                    Whoa dude. That is a lot of blood.
                    Where is he going?
                         

                    I dunno.

                         
                         
          Arius hobbles around leaving a trail of blood on the linoleum
          tiles as Principal Ganus and Mr. Applebaum appear on the
          scene and hold him up.
                         

                    An ambulance is on the way.
                         
          Arius is hobbled out. Ray is shepparded off by Mr.
          Applebaum..
                         
          A trail of small spats of blood across the linoleum floor.
                         
          Principal Ganus is surveying the scene with a few of the kids
          who were present.
                         

                         
          The crowd is filled with energy.
                         
          Brightly lit.   A home game. Everything is red, white, and
          black.
                         
          The glossy floor shines like it has just been polished.
                         
          Go-go music, blasting over the sub-par audio system, fades
          out.
                         
          The fifteen Blair Blazers in their red and white warm ups
          have taken center court for a ritual.
                         
          Huddled in a pack, hunched over and jumbled together with
          their arms around each other, swaying back and forth, they
          get pumped up:
                         

                    Who's house?

          Ad-lib hollers in excitement as the huddle breaks and they
          head for the bench.

                         
                         
          Players wipe the soles of their shoes on the way over.
                         

                     OK, starting five. Let's go.
                         
          Five players shed their warm ups and gather on the bench.
          Jolie is one of the starters.
                         

                     OK, we're gonna come out in a
                     twenty-two going black on made
                     buckets. Wendel and Jolie up front.
                         
          Everyone puts their hands in together in a circle.
                         

                     Defense on three.
                         

                     Defense on three. One! Two! Three!
                         

                         
          The bench players have formed an entry way for the starters
          to take the court.
                         
          On a crappy microphone:
                         

                     Starting at point guard. Number
                     twenty two. Joel "Jolie" Jolson.
                         
          Jolie trots the isle of his teammates. Wendel stoically slaps
          fives and gives pounds as he takes center floor.
                         
          He takes in the experience - looking at the huge crowd in the
          stands around him. All applauding.
                         
          Jolie's smile fades, and we see he has spotted Henrietta in
          the crowd, and not far from her - Christine.
                         
          Whistle!
                         

                         

                         
          The noises of the game and crowd are very frantic and
          everything is fast paced.
                         
          Coach Dale looks at the clock - 30 second left, Blair is down
          1 with the ball.

                         
                         

                    Jolie! Get back in the game! Take
                    Pistol.
                         
          Jolie barrels toward check-in ripping off his warm-ups (top
          and bottom), squats at mid court - the buzzer sounds - he
          taps Pistol an underhand five.
                         

                    Who you got?
                         
          Pistol points at a huge BLOND DUDE who pounds his chest
          ferociously.
                         
          A buzzer indicating a substitution.
                         
          Jolie is passed the ball - he puts a quick move on his man,
          jab step and cross, slicing through the lane. He fakes a pass
          behind his back and goes up for a lay up when his shot is
          blocked and he is slammed violently by a help-side defender.
                         
          The ref blows his whistle hard and gestures - calls a foul.
                         
          Jolie is on the ground in pain, holding his hand, wincing.
                         

                         
          Jolie still in his basketball attire, looks down over a large
          bandage on his thumb.
                         
          The microwave buzzes.
                         

                    That was a great move you made. You
                    would have been on the line for two
                    if that guy didn't injure you.
                         
          Jolie pushes his food away.
                         

                    Owwwww! My thumb. Sharp pain just
                    shot all the way threw my neck.
                         

                    Are you alright?
                         

                    Yeah.
                         

                    More ravioli or anything. I could
                    microwave some more.

                         
                         

                    No, I'm good.
                         

                         

                    I don't care if I go to Summer
                    School!
                         
          Crumpled on the steps, Henrietta shrieks again.
                         

                    This shit is meaningless! Who gives
                    a crap!?
                         
          A paper on the floor is marked with a big fat red F with a
          circle around it.
                         
          A note is paper-clipped to the corner of the page.
                         
          Henrietta shrieks again - launches her TI-81 Calculator at
          Mr. Aaronson, who dodges and it breaks a few plates that were
          on display.
                         
          Mr. Aaronson acts fast.
                         


                    You're gonna break this thing.
                         
          He checks the calculator and bee lines for the phone.

                    Unbelievable.
                         
          He dials - in the background kitchen Henrietta's STEP-MOM
          rises and comes to check out the commotion.
                         


                    Did Henrietta just break my

                    Shhhh.
                         
          Henrietta's shriek carries over into:
                         

                         
          Jolie and Elliott eat ice cream - they both look very tired.

                         
                         
          Jolie lies on the couch, still in uniform.
                         
          The late nights lurid news plays on a small white television.

          On the TV: Jordan's Dad's Red Lexus 400, parked, now with a
          smashed back window as well. The shot zooms into the license

          The phone rings.
                         
          Elliott checks the circa 90's caller ID - a separate box
          wired to the phone.
                         

                    The Aaronsons? At this hour? Should

          Jolie in his uniform and Timberland boots, and his Dad

          Jolie, still in his pajamas, walks up the steps then stops to
          look down them with frightened hesitation in his eyes.
                         
          The four parents look up - some give a few encouraging nods.
                         

                    You don't have to do this.
                         

                    Don't worry, I know how to help
                    Henrietta get her shit together.
                         

                    Jolie.
                         

                    Dad. Come on. You know what I mean.
                         

                         
          Total darkness. No TV. No overhead light. Both kids are
          wearing white.
                         
          Henrietta's stands in front of a mirror, face wet and red
          from crying.
                         
          Jolie hugs her from behind.
                         

                    Henrietta, your Dad showed me the
                    test. It was bad, but if you get an
                    A on your last exam you'll still
                    pass.

                         
                         
          He flicks on a soft warm lamp and kisses her neck.
                         

                    You just gotta learn to distribute.
                         

                    You really think I don't know how
                    to do that shit?
                         

                    What?
                         

                    That test isn't why I was so mad.
                         

                    What is it then? You can talk to
                    me. You can tell me anything.
                         

                    I wasn't invited with you guys to
                    the Tyson fight tomorrow. The one
                    on pay TV. I heard everyone was
                    going and I just flipped out. I
                    mean what's the deal?
                         

                    What? You mean the Bowe fight?
                         

                    Yeah. Bowe, Tyson, whatever. The
                    point is the whole team's going.
                         

                    Yeah. It's pretty much just a team
                    thing though.
                         

                    No it's not. Wendel, Arius, and
                    Codroy are all bringing girls.
                         

                    Oh. I didn't know that. Well, why
                    don't I just call you when I figure
                    out what time we're going.

          Henrietta puts her hand on his leg.
                         

                    Is it?

                         
                         

                    Yeah. And everyone's going to
                    Muhammad Ali's Rotiserie Chicken at
                    City Place.
                         
          She slides her hand up.

                    Yeah.
                         

                    Well, I don't know. You have a lot
                    of studying.
                         
          Uneasy with her advances, Jolie plucks a Cliff Livingston
          basketball card off the wall.
                         

                    Cliff Livingston. I forgot about
                    that guy.
                         
          Henrietta goes for a kiss.
                         

                    Henrietta. Come on? We're not
                    together anymore.
                         


                    You know Spud Web only gets a
                    roster spot because he's a circus
                    freak. He shouldn't be there, and
                    that's why he sells tickets. Don't
                    you get it. He's not good, he's
                    just a draw. Is that what you want
                    to be, a circus freak?
                         

                    He won the dunk contest. The guy's
                    a beast. You're way out of your
                    league.
                         

                    The league is about making money.
                    Jolie, the only reason you even got
                    on varsity is because your Dad paid
                    for the new uniforms. You never
                    would have made it even with
                    Francisco getting arrested. Don't
                    you realize that?

                         
                         

                    No he didn't.
                         

                    Yes he did. They cost over two
                    thousand dollars. How could you not
                    know that? I mean you made Varsity
                    at Blair after being cut from JV
                    last year. When have you ever seen
                    that happen?
                         
          The news hits Jolie hard.
                         

                    That's not true. Where did you hear
                    that?
                         

                    My Dad talking to your dad on the
                    phone in the kitchen.
                         
          Jolie looks at his bandaged hand - lost in deep depressing
          thought.
                         
          Henrietta leans into Jolie. Strokes his leg. Jolie, defeated,
          leans into her comforting arms.
                         

                    I still love you, though. None of
                    that matters to me.
                         
          Henrietta kisses him.
                         
          He kisses her back.
                         
          Henrietta's father knocks.
                         

                    Dad, we're studying here! Do you
                    mind?
                         


                    Sorry. I just wanted to see if you
                    guys needed anything.
                         
          Silence for a moment as the kids are frozen, then we hear him
          head down stairs.
                         
          Jolie lies down and Henrietta spoons him. They cuddle.

                         
                         

                         
          A full moon illuminates: Jolie leaves with his Dad and a big
          fat rice crispy treat in his mouth.
                         
          They pass a Black Volvo and an old Red Volkswagen Bug and
          Golden Retriever sleeping in the yard.
                         
          They hop into the Minivan. Jolie takes a big bite of the rice
          crispy treat as they drive past a "speed hump" sign.
                         


                    It must have been good for
                    Henrietta too, because afterwords,
                    she didn't mention joining the team
                    to the Bowe fight, she didn't
                    mention Christine, she didnt
                    mention nothing.
                         
          As they drive off Jolie looks back at Henrietta's home
          getting smaller and smaller. A speed hump sign in the
          foreground, and a basketball hoop set up on the street.
                         


                    Still though, I was worried she'd
                    show anyway. If she did, I didn't
                    know what I was gonna do.
                         

                         
          Wide, dark, empty streets, lit up by pools of light from
          street lamps.
                         
          Haroon and Jolie cross to: Muhammad Ali's Chicken, a
          restaurant with TV's in the windows, and a color scheme of
          red, black, and white.
                         

                    So she was just pissed because you
                    didn't invite her to this?
                         

                    Yeah.
                         

                    But it sounds like she was really
                    freaking out. I mean you said she
                    smashed their PC.
                         

                    Yeah, when I first got there she
                    didn't even have any clothes on.


                         

                    She threw her pajamas into the
                    fireplace. I swear to God.
                         

                    I don't know. I mean maybe
                    something more is going on?
                         
          They pass a BLIND BLACK MAN in a black suit poking around a
          seeing-eye stick, trying to orient himself.
                         

                    I mean, she's pregnant and it
                    sounds like she's keeping the baby.
                    Like she's fulfilling some need or
                    something.
                         

                    Yeah - the need for something.
                         
          They cackle.
                         

                    You wear a condom right?
                         

                    I don't have to. She's pregnant.
                         
          They laugh harder.
                         

                    Ah man. Ah man. That is crazy.
                         

                         
          They enter and their demeanors shift - they both affect
          bravado.
                         


                    Have you ever been here?
                         


                    Not for a fight?
                         

                         
          Haroon and Jolie walk threw looking for their friends; we
          take in the setting as they do.
                         
          An old dude finishes a coke through a straw; we hear the loud
          bubbling noise. The giant plastic cup has a picture of
          Muhammad Ali in his prime.

                         
                         
          B &amp; W Muhammad Ali posters fill the walls. Ali stands in
          glory over his unconscious opponents, or lays blows to their
          faces, sweat frozen in the air as it flies from their bodies.
                         
          The food is laid out cafeteria style. The tables and booths
          are a step above any fast food joint. Televisions hang from
          every angle, some even face the streets to attract
          pedestrians.
                         
          On every television, without exception: a boxing match. Bowe
          versus a large white guy, Golota.
                         
          Watching are about a hundred and fifty black people of all
          ages, mostly male, packing the restaurant.
                         
          The crowd subdued by the early rounds.
                         
          Jolie finds his friends from the team and their girlfriends
          lining the shinny metal railing that guides people along the
          buffet style assortment of chicken and biscuits.
                         
          Jolie is the only white person in the whole spot.
                         

                    Hey.
                         

                    Hey.
                         

                    Did you see those guys who killed
                    Jordan's Dad got life?
                         

                    Yeah. I did.
                         

                    They said, if only they had seen
                    the license plate, Airness. They --
                         

                    Never would have done it.
                         

                    Dude, my dad just 911-ed me.
                         

                    When did you get a pager?! That is
                    tight, dude.
                         

                    Last week. You just haven't been
                    around that much.

                         
                         
          Haroon peels off as the crowd ad-libs excitement. Jolie looks
          to the match.
                         
          We see the fight itself, close up on the television:
                         
          Bowe has Golota cornered.
                         
          A couple of blows are deflected and Golota, the lug, clinches
          Bowe in a bear hug.
                         
          Disappointment from the crowd.
                         

                    A sucker move.
                         
          The crowd roars again, but this time they rush to the windows
          - jostle for a view of the street where:
                         

                         
          Two black kids wrestle on the sidewalk.
                         
          We see Haroon behind them on the pay-phone, watching.
                         
          The kids fighting have jeans that are falling off and one of
          them has lost a gym shoe.
                         
          In the windows everyone cheers them on, pounding the
          Plexiglas. Including Jolie and Christine.
                         
          Above them in the windows are two televisions of the fight,
          that face the street. In the TV, the boxers and the referee
          shuffle aimlessly around the ring.
                         
          The kids on the sidewalk are scrappy; they grab and stretch
          at shirts; neither can escape the others' grasp.
                         
          They reach a stalemate, knotted awkwardly and exhausted; fury
          replaced by heavy breathing; one has a bloody nose and a huge
          scratch on the cheek
                         

                    You ripped my Polo shit,
                    motherfucker! You ripped my Polo
                    shit!
                         

                    You scratched my face, nigger!
                         
          The crowd watches the stalemate and the cheering and pounding
          mellows, slowly they bore, returning to their seats.
                         
          Suddenly on the television there is a whirlwind of action and
          punches are chaotically thrown by both fighters.

                         
                         
          The crowd erupts at the televisions.
                         
          The kids on the sidewalk remain tangled, breathing hard.
                         
          On television Golota throws a combo of blows below the belt
          and Bowe tumbles to the mat. The referee jumps and waves
          furiously at the penalty which he reports to the judges in a
          series of arm waves and animated hand signals.
                         
          We see the people in the front rows at the boxing match,
          almost all white, and wearing glamorous suits and dresses.
                         
          The patrons go berserk.
                         
          Extreme close-up on the replay: Golota pounding Bowe in the
          nuts; Bowe's face distorted in pain.
                         
          Ad-lib excitement from everyone but Jolie who is looking over
          at the entrance.
                         


                    Strangely Henrietta never showed. I
                    should have been relieved, but
                    instead I felt awful. It was like
                    yesterday we were in love and today
                    she didn't even care I was with
                    Christine.
                         
          They all look at the TV - Golota has won - his arm is raised,
          he's the new champion of the boxing world.
                         

                         
          The little gravel parking lot is filled to the brim. Kids of
          all shapes and sizes are gathering. Some carry signs. Most
          are wearing red and white.
                         
          The opposing school kids wear blue.
                         


                    This is what it all comes down to.
                         

                         
          The streets lined with cars.
                         
          Kids and parents walk in droves.
                         


                    This is where we find out what
                    we're made of.

                         
                         

                         
          The line spirals around the corner and down the steps.
                         


                    What we have trained for, not just
                    this season, but for you seniors,
                    the last four years.
                         
          CLOSE ON: A ticket torn at the door. One in a long line.
                         

                         
          Coach Dale is directly in front of a stand alone chalk board.
                         


                    Is it unfair that we drew
                    Springbrook in the first round?
                    Yes. Random seeding is only because
                    the sorry white schools complained
                    to the school board about always
                    losing in the first round. When I
                    was younger the regular season
                    meant something around here.
                         
          Coach Dale begins diagraming the board.
                         

                    But that means nothing now. We
                    gotta go out and play no matter
                    what. We're gonna open in a one-
                    twenty-two. Wendel on the ball,
                    Pistol on the two. Falling back
                    into the half court, we go one-
                    twenty FIVE. Forcing left. Trap and
                    take the throwback.

                    Where's Jolie?
                         

                    He's such a goof ball, man. This is
                    the playoffs. Where is he at?!
                    Who's seen Jolie?!
                         

                         
          Three Cheerleaders drag Jolie, with his bandaged thumb, to
          the showers. Jolie looks genuinely scared.

                         
                         

                      Ms. Bart. I know you're the
                      cheerleading coach and all, but
                      this really better be important.
                      I'm supposed to be in the weight-
                      room by now.
                         

                      You're injured. And like I said,
                      this is more important than any
                      basketball game. This is life or
                      death Jolie.
                         
          They arrive at the last shower stall - Christine on her knees
          in tears.
                         

                      Christine?
                         
          Jolie steps into the shower.
                         
          The Coach leaves them alone.
                         

                      Jolie. I haven't had my period in
                      three months.
                         
          She sobs.
                         
          Jolie gets on his knees.
                         

                      Well, maybe you should get one of
                      those things and check it out.
                         

                      A pregnancy test?
                         

                      Yeah.
                         

                      I did.

                      I'm pregnant with your baby.
                         
          She cries and shivers.
                         
          Beat.
                         

                      No worries. My Dad will let me put
                      it on his credit card. Trust me.

                         
                         
          She cries.
                         
          Suddenly Jolie has a face of determination. He unwraps his
          bandaged thumb and throws it on the floor.
                         

                       Oh God. I'm sorry.
                         

                       No. It's not your fault. I gotta
                       run though. Let's talk about this
                       after the game, OK? The team needs
                       me.
                         
          Christine nods but clearly wants to refuse.
                         

                       What for? You're injured anyway.
                         

                       I'm ok though. I can play through
                       it. do you understand. I just gotta
                       do this?
                         

                       What? I just told you I'm pregnant
                       with your baby. Doesn't that mean
                       anything.
                         

                       Tonight I'm gonna play for you and
                       our baby.
                         
          Jolie kisses her and runs off.
                         
                         

                         
          Jolie sneaks in.
                         
          Coach Dale notices.
                         

                       Jolie! Where the hell have you
                       been!?
                         

                       I got stuck with no toilet paper,

                       Damn man. This is the biggest game
                       of the year.

                         
                         

                    I know. It wasn't my fault. I gotta
                    be light on my feet.

                    My hand is all better. Look.
                         
          Jolie takes a ball from an assistant coach and pounds it
          showing no sign of pain. Then palms it in his bad hand.
                         
          Dale stares at him like he's a fool.

          The coaches exit, and the players quiet down for a quick
          prayer.

          The two assistant coaches scramble in with game balls and
          hand them off to the first and second players in line. Jolie
          ditches his practice ball and files in.
                         
          The players start clapping in rhythm. One. One, two. One.

                    That night. I never played. None of
                    us did. Because there never was a
                    game. Before the opening tip even
                    kicked it off a fight between
                    schools broke out in the crowd.
                    Some fired a gun twice, and all

          cheerleaders, no longer in uniform, pass by. Jolie waves and
          Christine holds up both hands as if to say "come on" and
          continues walking...
                         
          Suddenly a group of black girls come barreling down the
          hallway like they are possessed.
                         
          They are followed in droves by other minorities.
                         
          Black girls bounce up and down and cry and paw at each other.
                         
          Black boys and kids of other races, not quite as ecstatic but
          still amazed join the celebration.
                         
          A couple of kids are slammed loudly against the window in the
          excitement.

                         
                         
          Through the glass Jolie can hear:
                         

                    We won! We won! We won!
                         
          SUPERIMPOSE in the top left corner in white letters: OJ
          Simpson was just found not guilty.
                         
          The hallway is growing into total commotion and chaos.
                         
          Jolie walks through the doorway into the hall and the camera
          follows without a cut.
                         
          Jolie looks out of place as he takes it all in.
                         
          The wild scene rages.
                         
          Jolie looks back into the main office.
                         
          Ray comes out of Principal Ganus's door. His eyes red from
          tears, he curses to himself.
                         
          Principal Ganus emerges, acknowledges the commotion in the
          hallway.
                         

                    What the hell is going on out
                    there?
                         

                    OJ Simpson....not guilt.
                         
          Principal Ganus is stone faced. He gestures Jolie into his
          office.
                         
          Ray brushes shoulders with Jolie.
                         

                    You're dead.
                         

                    Look who you're stepping to, Ray. A
                    little white boy?
                         
          Ray blows it off.
                         


                    Jolie. Come with me.

                         
                         

                         

                    Look. I'm not proud of what
                    happened in that gym.
                         
          Surrounded by proud school ornaments and paraphernalia.
                         
          Jolie sits alone in a chair, an empty chair adjacent him.
                         

                    Everyone who was caught fighting is
                    being suspended for a minimum of
                    three days. And that includes most
                    of the team. But a suspension for
                    you would only tarnish the
                    reputation of the Magnet program.
                    So...
                         
          Principal Ganus thumbs through a manila envelope.
                         

                    You're going to do this school a
                    favor,

                    at the international math meet.
                         
          He hands Jolie a form.
                         

                    You were great your freshman year.
                    Your calculus teacher tells me your
                    still great, but for some reason
                    you quit.
                         

                    I made JV that year.
                         

                    Well, there's going to be no
                    rematch of the Springbrook playoff
                    game. Both teams are forfeiting. So
                    now you've got plenty of time,
                    that's for damn sure.
                         

                    They're not rescheduling our game?
                    That's insane.
                         

                    The math team needs you Jolie.
                    We're on the verge of nationals.


                         
                               PRINCIPAL GANUS 
                    This year we settles for nothing
                    less than number one, second to
                    none.

                    In whole numbers.
                         
          The principal laughs at his own joke.
                         

                    You can go now.
                         
          Stunned, Jolie grabs his bag and heads for the door.
                         

                    Oh, one more thing. You will also
                    join the team for an additional 40
                    hours of community service, as part
                    of the new "Adopt a Highway"
                    Program. It's part of the team
                    punishment.
                         
                         

                         

                    It's not fair man. I mean everyone
                    got suspended on the team but me.
                    Just because I'm in the Magnet.
                         

                    Wake up dude. Life's not fair. Who
                    ever said it was.
                         

                    Are you sure you wanna do that?
                    We're in the middle of C hall.
                         

                    I told you. I don't give a fuck.
                         

                    Really? On Mr. Applebaum's door?
                    Yall have been warring. He's gonna
                    know it was you.
                         

                    So what?
                         
          Haroon pulls out a spray-paint can and writes the words
          'Thugg Life' over Mr. Applebaum's classroom door and wall.
                         


                    Jesus Christ, man.

          They admire the work for a moment. Then run for cover.
                         
          They burst through an exit and out into the blinding light.
                         
                         

                         
          Haroon and Jolie run into the teachers' parking lot ducking
          between cars as they catch their breath.
                         

                    You could get suspended for that.
                         

                    Who cares? What does school even
                    matter?
                         

                    What's gotten into you?
                         

                    I don't know.

                    Maybe my parents are getting
                    divorced and you don't even know

          Haroon draws the spray can like he's about to go to work on
          the cars, but Jolie fights him for it.

          They stair each other down.

                    Are you numb? The whole school

                    your baby.
                         

                    Dude. It's not like that. She's
                    gonna get an abortion. She comes
                    from a wealthy family.
                         

                    So what if she does. Doesn't it

                    I don't know. I don't know what it

          Jolie ponders the situation. Haroon shakes his head.
                         
          Jolie pulls out a magic marker and begins to write on the
          car.
                         

                    Magic marker? That is so lame.

          Lit by a TV, the room could be it's own apartment.
                         
          Wendel sleeps with a Super Nintendo controllers in his laps,
          on a futon. Arius, Codroy and a few kids from the team are

                    cheerleaders came too.
                         
          Christine and Jolie make-out, lying on the floor/power pad.

          Soda cans, crumbs, bags of chips, and other treats and

                    hiding in your shower?

                    Yeah, dude. Check it.
                         
          Jolie grabs a portable phone, bracing himself for battle.
                         

                         

                    Who's there?

                    Damn Henrietta. You scared the shit
                    out of me.

                         
                         

                    How could you?
                         
          She opens the curtains.
                         

                    What? What are you doing in my
                    basement bathroom?
                         

                    I'm catching you cheating with

                    Don't lie to me. You think I dont
                    know shit. She's pregnant with your

                    hear mad junk about the Magnet

                    I know about all that stuff, how
                    y'all hooked up during floor hockey
                    intramurals under the trampoline.
                    Everything. You think I don't have
                    friends? I have friends!
                         
          Henrietta starts crying.
                         

                    Come on, I know you have friends
                    Henrietta.
                         

                    You think I'm a fool? I watched you
                    make out with her on the Power-pad
                    two second ago!
                         
          Crying, Henrietta exits.
                         
          The basketball team and cheerleaders have woken up from the
          argument, and are now enraptured by the drama.

                         
                         
          Jolie and Haroon looks like dear in headlights.
                         

                    All this time you've been hooking
                    up with some pregnant girl failing
                    out of school. I am so fucking
                    humiliated right now. Don't you
                    ever, ever, ever so much as speak
                    to me again. Come on girls.
                         
          Christine and three other cheerleaders leave the party.
                         

                    Damn Jolie, all the girls just
                    bounced.
                         

                    Yea, let's get out of here.
                         
          The kids from the team leave and Jolie and Haroon stand
          alone.
                         

                    Damn man. I better go too. This
                    shit is too fucked up right now.
                         
          Jolie stands all alone.
                         
                         

                         
          The street sign reads Maple Ave.
                         
          It is lined with tall apartment buildings. Government
          housing. Bus stops. And cheap liquor stores and sub shops.
                         
          Jolie walks down the street.
                         


                    The next day I found out Christine
                    had the abortion on her own. She
                    said she asked the doctor to see
                    the fetus.
                         
          Jolie approached one of the apartment buildings.
                         

                        
                    The doctor said she wasn't supposed
                    to showed it, but did anyway.
                         
          Jolie buzzes up to an apartment.

                         
                         

                         

                         
          Jolie rises.
                         

                         
                     Christine said the dead fetus
                     looked like a baby squirrel. Like
                     the ones that fall out of the nest
                     and are on the sidewalk dead with
                     no fur yet. I guess it went well
                     though.
                         
                         

                         
          The living room of a small dim one bedroom.
                         
          Sensual R&amp;B tunes play softly from a small radio.
                         

                         
                     After that Arius said not to worry
                     about anything. That Christine
                     would be cool, and Henrietta was
                     just fucked up anyway.
                         
          A gold cross hangs on the fake wood paneling with some framed
          family photos at a summer bar-b-que, a wedding, and the
          beach.
                         

                         
                     He even invited me back to his
                     place. It was the first time I had
                     ever been to Maple ave.
                         
          Four kids from the team are playing cards around a coffee
          table for one dollar bills siting mostly on a puffy floral
          patterned couch covered in shinny plastic.
                         

                         
                     Everybody played this ghetto

          They all wear Addidas flip flops with socks and name brand
          sweatpants . Some of the kids
          have on athletic shorts on under their sweatpants,

                         
                         
          In the background, Jolie has a gray ratty hoody on, and is
          hunched over and old PC computer with Arius, a beer-bellied,
          balding black dude who is smoking a cigarette and has no
          shirt on.
                         

                      Jolie, you want in?
                         
          Everyone else, other than Jolie, is also shirtless. The kids
          have exquisite ABS, the kind you see on television.
                         

                      Naw. I gotta see this.
                         

                      Ok. Here it goes.
                         

                         
          An arrow clicks on the play button, but the image stays
          frozen: a low res picture of a bare ass black man mounted
          miliary style on a black girl.
                         
          The image moves for a brief moment. We hear a grown with half
          a thrust, and the image freezes again.
                         
          Then it reverts to the beginning image.
                         

                      Wow.
                         

                      Yeah. This is the future right
                      here.
                         

                      Why wont it go play or whatever?

          Jolie tokes a blunt.
                         
          Arius takes a last puff and puts it out.
                         
          A little cute six year old girl comes out of the bedroom with
          a sheet of paper and pencil.

          She runs back into the bedroom.
                         

                    So. That's what it's all about. I'm
                    a capital venturist man. Internet
                    porn is the future of sexual
                    healing. Henrietta was just the
                    first of many. It's big business.
                    Dollar bills man.
                         
          Jolie looks on, stoned. Not sure what to make of it all.
                         
                         

                         
          A six lane highway banks a sharp curve. It's raining lightly.
                         
          On the shoulder of the highway are kids from the Blair
          Basketball team picking up trash with pokers. They are spread
          out - a kid every 25 yards or so - and together they extend
          clear around the curve and out of sight.
                         
          Jolie pokes a Coke can.
                         
          Jolie plucks the can off the end metal nail and realizes he
          also stabbed the tape liner notes of MC Hammer's "Please
          Hammer Don't Hurt'em." There is a picture of Hammer on the
          cover.
                         
          The coach sits in a nearby van with its lights on, parked in
          the shoulder. He sips hot coffee, watching.
                         
          Jolie looks closely at the tape insert.
                         
          It's a picture of Hammer but someone has scratched out his
          eyes with a pen. And the poker has put a hole through his
          face.
                         


                    I wasn't sure what to make of it
                    all. Why Henrietta's parents never
                    know she was pregant until too
                    late? Or why I never said something
                    myself? It was like none of it
                    really mattered, or was even real
                    at all, until it was too late.

                         
                         
          CLOSE ON: An old PC monitor. A picture slowly emerging from a

                    After that I used the internet to
                    find a bunch of places that would
                    take Henrietta's baby up for
                    adoption. It wasn't easy, but I
                    found all the information right
                    from Haroon's basement, using
                    Netscape.
                         
          The picture of a couple materializes: hopeful parents and

                    Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're perfect.
                    All I have to do is convince
                    Henrietta.
                         

                    Are you guys still on good terms?

                    I've made some grill cheeses! Come
                    and get it!
                         

                    Sweet! Now that Mom moved out we
                    always eat American. You wanna eat
                    with us?
                         

                    I do but there's something I gotta
                    do.
                         

                    Oh yeah. That's right.   Well, good
                    luck with it all.
                         
                         

                         
          Henrietta lies on the bed studying.
                         
          Mr. Aaronson enter.
                         

                    Hey Henrietta. Jolie is here. He
                    brought over a gift.
                         

                    Oh yeah. Let him in.

                         
                         

                    Hey. What's up? Uh. I brought over
                    my Super Nintendo. I thought the
                    baby might want it.
                         

                    Did Jaguar 64 finally come out?
                         

                    No. Come on. I'm just trying to
                    show you I actually care.
                         
          Mr. Aaronson smiles and leaves, closing the door lightly
          behind him.
                         
          Jolie hands over the Nintendo.
                         

                    And I brought this too.
                         
          Jolie pulls a jersey out of a paper bag.
                         

                    Your practice Jersey!
                         

                    Yeah. I'm not gonna need it anymore
                    so.
                         

                    Really? Why not?
                         

                    I'm not playing next year. I want
                    to focus on my studies.
                         

                    Jolie. Thank you.

                    It smells like you. Someday little
                    Benny will wear it. That's what
                    I've decided to name him, Benny.
                         

                    Oh. Wow. Well. Uh, before you name
                    him, I was kinda thinking maybe we
                    could discuss, uh,
                         

                    What?
                         

                    Well,
                        


                         

                    I was also thinking maybe we could
                    talk about the possibility of you
                    giving up your baby for adoption?
                         

                    Jolie. How could you even say that?
                    I've wanted a family of my own, a
                    real family, since as long as I can
                    remember. There is no way I could
                    ever give little Benny away. Ever.
                    In a million years. Do you
                    understand that?
                         

                    Well. Yeah. I guess so. But at the
                    same time, it just doesn't seem
                    like the smartest thing. I've
                    already found a really wealthy,
                    well educated, good meaning couple
                    who'd like to meet up with you
                    about it.
                         

                    Never. No way Jolie. End of
                    discussion.
                         

                    Don't you even want to think it
                    over for a few days? I mean, look
                    how lucky your parents are to have
                    you. You'd be making some couple
                    just as happy. And your child would
                    have more opportunities. I mean
                    you're still in High School, know
                    what I mean?
                         

                    Jolie, I can't even believe you're
                    suggesting that? Dont you see how
                    racist that is?
                         

                    What?
                         
          Jolie is silent.
                         

                    Now do something to cheer me up. I
                    am totally offended you wanted to
                    give away my baby.
                         
          Jolie sits in silence for a moment, pondering his situation.
                         
          He stands up and heads to the door, demoralized.

                         
                         
          Then he turns and looks at Henrietta on the bed.
                         
          Jolie looks at her bulging belly, much of it exposed.
                         

                         
                         

                         
          Credits roll to Micheal Jackson's Billy Jean.
