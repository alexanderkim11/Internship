    IRVING ROSENFELD, not a small man, gets dressed and
    meticulously constructs his combover. Camera WRAPS AROUND,
    see his hands with rings adjust his dark velvet suit, up to
    his face, serious, concentrated, intense, he is composing
    himself before a performance.

    Irving is now dressed, ready, and walks down the hall to
    another room.



    Irving composes himself -- looks     
    into cramped surveillance closet, there are FBI Agents -- we
    only see their hands and arms -- he looks at monitors -- sees
    a BLACK AND WHITE IMAGE OF ANOTHER ROOM ON MONITOR: MAYOR
    CARMINE POLITO, swath of salt and pepper hair, cream suit,
    pinky ring, Rotary Club pin -- ALONG WITH CARL ELWAY, preppie
    shady businessman.

    He exhales pressure, turns as CAMERA PANS TO: SYDNEY PROSSER
    ,
    stylish crafty smart. They stare at each other intensely --
    they have a deep and emotional relationship. A DOOR BANGS
    OPEN, and in walks RICHIE DIMASO, Bronx-born. He stands
    there.


               What are you doing, going behind my
               back? Telling people I'm screwing
               up this operation? I got you a
               suite at the fuckin' Plaza Hotel!


               The shittiest suite at the Plaza
               Hotel.



               What?!


               The shittiest fuckin' suite.


               Based on what--?




               And the food is wrong, and--What is
               this? You, like, went in my closet
               or something?


               No


               Are you dressing him like you're
               dressing me now?


                   
               No, what are you thinking? This
               isn't all about you, you know that.


               What, did you try to dress me so I
               would look like him?


               No, you're not dressed like him,
               all right?


               But I do, I look like him.


               No, he's in like, velvet. Come on.


               You asked me to show you how this
               was done, you wanna fuck it up be
               my guest.


               What is your problem?



               Hey, look, I never laid a hand on
               her, all right? Is that what this
               is about?


                        
               Well technically, that's not true.


               Look, we never had sex ok? I just --




               What'd I do? I put my hand like
               this --

    Richie reaches out and puts his hand on Irving's face very
    carefully, not forcefully.

    Irving swipes it away violently the second it touches his
    face.


          Don't you fucking touch me. That
          bothers me --


          Oh it does?


          Oh yeah.


          That bothers you?


          Yes.


          You know, a lot of shit bothers me
          too, but I was trying to help you.
          If I wanted to bother you, if I
          really wanted to fucking bother
          you, this is what I'd do.


    Richie takes his hand and destroys the combover Irving spent
    so much time creating. Irving just stands there, hair ruined,
    staring at Richie.


          You shouldn't have done that.

    Irving just stands there staring at Richie, hair all wild and
    messed up looking very angry.


          How's that? You bothered now? (no
          answer) Alright, don't make a thing
          of it.


          You shouldn't touch him. He doesn't
          like that.




              Oh my god, fix his hair. Don't make
              a thing of it.


              It takes some time, ok.

    Edith walks over to Irving who is still standing there in
    silence with his hair all over the place. She carefully
    starts helping him put it back together.


              Big fucking deal. We got to get in
              the other room, come on. The
              mayor's in there.


              Yes I know that.


              Should we go to the beauty parlor?
              Is that what we should do?

    Richie walks over and opens up a briefcase that's sitting on
    the dresser. Inside are stacks of cash.

    Edith is still helping Irving put his hair back together.


              How's it look.


              You look fine.

    Richie slams the briefcase shut looking very nervous and
    intense.


              Let's go.











    SLOW MOTION -- DOUBLE DOORS PUSH OPEN AND Edith ENTERS THE
















              I thought he was going to be here.
              I do business face to face, person
              to person. That's just who I am.


    Richie reaches down and awkwardly slides the briefcase over
    to Carmine unprompted. LEAVE MONITOR'S POV AND RETURN BACK TO







              Whoa, excuse me, excuse me. I'll
              handle that for the Mayor.


              No, it's for the Mayor. It would be
              a sign of disrespect to the sheik
              if the mayor didn't take it
              himself. It's for you Mayor.

    Carmine looks angry and confused. He looks over to Carl.


              What are you doing? What-- (to
              Carl) Carl, what the fuck? What is
              this?


              No, I'll handle it. I'm gonna take
              care of-- Everything's good. I
              got everything under control. (TO
              RICHIE) That's for me. I handle all
              that for mayor.


              What is this?

    Irving looks over and says nothing. Not surprised at all how
    badly this is all going.



Edith whispers to Richie.


          
          Just stop it, ok


          
          He's gotta take it himself, okay?


          I don't know what the fuck that is
          but it's weird you understand?


          Misunderstanding. Misunderstanding.


          I came here to meet a sheik, that's
          all I know. I'm very interested in
          that but he's not here apparently.
          Carl?!

Carmine turns and starts to walk out of the room.


          I'm very interested in meeting the
          Sheik. You let me know when THAT
          could happen! Thank you, have a
          good day.

Carmine leaves the room.

Irving looks over and shrugs his shoulders. Not surprised at
all the way this is going and horrified that Richie has
ruined it.


              
          Irving! You better come get him.



              
          Go out there and get him right now.


          Help me get him back!


          Go get him. He needs to take the
          fuckin' briefcase, Irving.




          I didn't wanna do it in the first
          place. This is your show, YOU go
          get him.


          No, you have no choice. You have
          to go get him. Now, go get him, so
          he takes the briefcase by himself!
          That's the whole plan, Irving!

Irving stands up angry and gets in Richie's face.


          What were you doing pushing the
          fucking briefcase, dummy? Huh?


          The whole fuckin' thing was falling
          apart. You know how much I paid
          for this goddamn hotel that you
          fucking asked for?!


          Now I gotta go mop up your mess.
          I'm gonna go fucking mop up your
          mess!

Irving storms out of the hotel suite towards the Elevators to
get Carmine.




Irving paces back and forth as he waits for the elevator.




We push in on the concerned face of Sydney as Richie rambles
on to her.


          You understand what I'm saying,
          right? It wasn't working.




Irving continues to pace back and forth in the hall waiting
for the elevator.




               Did you ever have to find a way to
               survive and you knew your choices
               were bad?

     Irving walks over and hits the elevator button again.


               I learned how to survive when I was
               a kid.




               My father had a glass business.




     Drumming up business for his father.



     Young Irving and his Father and Mother standing outside the
     family's glass repair shop in the Bronx as some tough
     contractors march up to them.


               I would rather be on the taking
               side than the getting taken side
               any day of the week, especially
               after I saw how my father got
               taken. I mean, seeing that scarred
               me for life.




     Young Irving runs by a store front as he throws a rock
     through each window on the store, smashing them all.


               I took it upon myself to drum up
               business. I became a different kind
               of guy than my father. I became a
               con artist -- from the feet up, for
               real.






     Irv shakes his head, surveys the damage.




               I was gonna survive no matter what.
               I still had the glass business and
               a few dry cleaning stores on the
               side.




     Irving paces around his office smoking a cigar and talking on
     the phone. What looks to be stolen art sits on the floor all
     around him.


               And I did some art dealing on the
               side. Stolen or forged art.




     Chicago's "Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?" fades
     up. Jamming early 70s HOLIDAY party -- LONG ISLAND LADIES IN

     ENCLOSED POOL -while inside steamed glass SHINY BIKINI

     GUYS WHO LOOK MOBBED UP, pale, out of shape, gold chains, in
     swim trunks, EVEN MORE BURT REYNOLDS TYPE GUYS, slim, hairy,
     chains.


               So, one January I go to my friends
               pool party in Long Island.

     Irving sits holding court with some friends by the pool when
     he turns and sees Sydney for the first time.

     PUSH IN ON: Irving. He looks up, they lock eyes across the
     party.


     IRVING'S HAND GRABS HER ARM -- she turns, taken aback -


               Is that Duke Ellington on your
               bracelet?

     She does have on a Duke Ellington charm bracelet.


               As a matter of fact, it is. He died
               this year, you know.




          I know. I doubt anyone else here
          knows or cares about it.


          Well I care. He saved my life many
          times.

Irving takes a good look at her, impressed.


              
          Mine too. Which one?



          Jeep's Blues.


              
          Jeep's Blues. Oh yeah.

Awkward pause.


          You wanna hear it?


          Right now?


          Yeah.


          Sure.

CUT TO: PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER PLAYS START OF JEEP'S BLUES as
Irving and Sydney nod to it - he watches her foot in her high
wedge and her tanned leg rocking as she sits on arm of sofa.


          Who starts a song like that?!


          It's magic.


          Magic.

They listen to the record, Edith checks Irving out.




              He wasn't necessarily in good
              shape, and he had this comb-over
              that was rather -- elaborate. He
              had this air about him. And he had
              this confidence that drew me to
              him. He was who he was and he
              didn't care.


              Like me, she was a very particular
              person. Like me, she came from a
              place where her options were
              limited -- and she had been someone
              she didn't want to be in her past.





              It actually can feel kind of sexy
              sometimes. There's a boldness in
              it. But where would that boldness
              take me? I didn't know. But I was
              gonna find out.












              Like me, she learned to survive and
              reinvent herself. She knew she had
              to reinvent her life and her
              identity. And like me, she
              envisioned a better elegant future
              for herself. Like me, she knew you
              had to have a vision.




    Sydney looks at scrap of paper with info in her hand -- looks
    up at office building address -- enters.


              She came to New York. She
              envisioned it.




               And just like that, she applied for
               a job at Cosmopolitan Magazine.




     Clean bright colors, huge blown up Cosmo covers --

     Sydney -- innocent, plain, slacks and blouse, hair back,
     nervously awaits interview.

     SHE IS CALLED IN -- NERVOUSLY STANDS, small crumpled scrap of
     paper in hand, FIXES HER HAIR --





               Well you're obviously here for a
               reason. Let's get to it.


               Alright.


               Our cover story right now is on
               cunnilingus. What do you think
               about that?


               I like it.


               Do you have any clerical skills?


               Yes.


               Can you type?


               She was unlike anybody I ever knew.
               She was smart. She saw through
               people in situations. And she knew
               how to live with passion and style.
               She understood Duke Ellington.








15   CUT TO: Edith WATCHES A COSMO COVER SHOOT --                 15


               I was broke, fearless, with nothing
               to lose --




     Irv and Sydney dance slowly.


               -- and my dream,   more than
               anything, was to   become anyone else
               other than who I   was.




     Irv holds the door open for Edith as she enters.


               -- I got two in the Bronx and three
               in Manhattan.  Hey,
               Byron.


               He had a chain of dry cleaning
               stores. He asked me to come in and
               upgrade my wardrobe-- he said a lot
               of nice things got left behind by
               people and forgotten over the years-



               I mean you wouldn't believe the
               shit that people leave behind here.
               Unbelievable.


               People leave stuff here?


               Oh yeah. They go out for the night,
               they drink, come here in the
               morning, put their clothes in and
               then they forget. They got no idea
               where they left it.

     Irving touches a hanging blue sequined dress.


               Look at that. Sequined thing. I
               don't know. Is that nice or not?




          It's beautiful.

Irving and Sydney continue to walk through towards the back
and enter a fur vault filled with elegant designer clothes.


          I mean, some of it's been here for
          years. They're not picking it up.
          Nobody's picking it up.

Sydney starts riffling through nice things hanging on the
racks.


          You like that?


          I love it.


          It's yours. You want it? It's
          yours.

Sydney looks back at Irving in shock.





          You look fantastic!


          Oh my god. I can only dream about
          these dresses. They're beautiful.











          I felt like we had a secret. Just
          the two of us. You know like that
          thing where you want to just be
          with the one person the whole time.




               You feel like the two of you
               understand something that nobody
               else gets. I could just tell her
               everything about myself. And I
               never had anybody like that in my
               life before. I felt like finally, I
               can truly be myself without being
               ashamed, without being embarrassed.

39   INT. Irv's dingy office - DAY                                 39

     Irv leads Sydney into a small, dingy Manhattan office on an
     upper floor.


               What is this place? Do you sell art
               here?


               Yeah, sometimes. This is my office.


               I know it's your office, but, you
               have these other places. What's
               this for? Why did you bring me
               here?


               This getting to be my main
               business, my growing business. I
               help get loans for guys that can't
               get loans. I'm their last resort.


               You're their last resort? Because
               interest rates are north of 12% and
               heading to 18%.


               That's right, smarty pants.


               Fucking Jimmy Carter. Fucking Nixon
               really. And the war and the
               deficit and all of that shit.


               I love you, you're so smart. You
               are.


               Thanks kid but how do you get them
               the money?




          Well --


          You don't do you? You don't.


          These guys are lousy risks, you
          know? I can't get them a loan but I
          get my fee. Five thousand.


          Five thousand? You take five
          thousand and you don't give them
          anything?


          These are bad guys, you know? They
          got bad divorces, gambling habits,
          embezzling, all that shit, you know
          what I mean?


          Everybody at the bottom crosses
          paths eventually in a pool of
          desperation and you're waiting for
          them.


          How about `we'?


          We?


          How bout it?

Sydney turns and begins walking out the door as Irving chases
her out.


          Sydney. Sydney I'm sorry that was
          too much. I went too far. I didn't
          want to upset you.

She continues walking out without looking back and leaves.


          Sydney please, I'm sorry! I know it
          ain't for everybody.

The door slams in Irving's face




              (Irving shouts to the
               closed door)
          Ah GOD I love getting to know you!









          What I do that for? I fucked it up.
          I should never tell a woman the
          truth. She's so smart. She's
          different.







          You said it was nice knowing me.
          You said it was nice to meet me.


          Yeah.




              
          Would you like to meet Lady Edith
          Greensly?

Irving looks stunned as he slowly clasps her extended hand.


              
          I have royal banking connections in
          London. I'd love to help you with
          your loan but of course I have to
          be very selective.


          That was fucking fantastic.


          Thank you. Did you like it?




               I liked it. I didn't think you were
               coming back. Thank god you came
               back.


               I wasn't going anywhere.


               I fucking love you.


               You have me.






     ONE OF SYDNEY'S NANNY FRIENDS, REBECCA, walk out of a
     BUSINESS MAN's  house pushing a stroller as the business
     man comes chasing after them.


               And so Irving and I began our
               partnership -- in love and
               commerce.



               Rebecca, hold on. You're Edith
               right?



               He told me to tell my friends I had
                London banking
               connections


               I'm Jim. I'm her employer. Listen -
               - she told me you can get me a line
               of credit. I know you have banking
               connections in London, England.


               And after that...say "no" a lot
               until the guy is hooked.

     Edith and Rebecca start walking away as the businessman
     chases after them.




               Becky tell her! I've never missed a
               check!


                     



               It was almost scary how easy it
               could be to take money from
               desperate people.






     Edith extends her hand to greet ANOTHER BUSINESSMAN, 35.
     Edith is dressed in a more sophisticated high end British
     fashion.


               Lady Edith Greensly, it's so good
               to see you again.


               Lady -- your ladyship -- thank you
               again.


               These are the roles that we were
               meant to play.




     Another desperate businessman sits across from Edith and
     Irving.


               We're very selective.


               You got a strong application. We'll
               talk about it.





               I don't take a deal that I can't
               close.




          You're not being aggressive enough
          in putting up your assets --

The man looks nervous --


          Have you ever been to Queens? Have
          you ever been to Great Neck?
          Everybody knows my dealerships.





A desperate man takes out a BUSINESS CHECK BOOK and writes
his check.


          Five thousand gets me fifty right?


          Five will get me thirty five. Is
          that right?


          Five grand gets me fifty?




Sydney and Irving laugh and celebrate.


          I was doing so much more business
          with her. I mean it doubled, then
          it tripled.




Sydney -- hair getting bigger -- goes over the books with a
Latino Man who nods and watches her --

Edith counts cash in the register - recounts it -- explains
how things can be done better as DRY CLEANING WORKER nods.

Irv watches happy.


          And I never met anyone, man or
          woman, in business who was so
          careful and precise about
          everything. Every stylistic detail.





     Irving and Edith discuss a piece of art they're in the
     process of selling to a businessman.


               We kept selling art together, too.


               It's really a fabulous example of a
               genre painting, which is really
               rare for the time. It's a boy and
               his dog. Non-religious painting.
               55. Golden age. Dutch painting.








               Paul Klee. Bauhaus Movement. 1920s.


               Before we go any further, is this
               legit?


               Let's just say it's missing from
               Spain and leave it at that.


               Don't show any Spanish friends.

     Irving and Sydney kiss passionately in front of the middle
     aged car dealer as he tries to hand them his check.


               I mean it just took off. We got an
               elegant Manhattan office. We called
               it London Associates for her
               accent.





     LONDON ASSOCIATES to a pale wall as he and Edith sip
     champagne from flutes and offer one to the worker who toasts
     with them.






     Irv and Edith kiss gently, lovingly, sincerely on the lips --

     They walk into their CLASSIC LOOKING, STAID, PRIVATE BANKING



               When I was around her I felt joy.
               Fucking joy! And love. That's what
               I felt.






47   They dance down Park Avenue together.                           47



     Irv and Edith dance through the lobby.




     As they dance among mostly older wealthy couples on the small
     dance floor of the elegant restaurant as a live jazz quartet
     plays "I've Got Your Number". Camera circles them, putting
     their foreheads together, very happy. THEY SING TO EACH
     OTHER quietly as they dance close.




     Irv and Edith make passionate love, we see in pieces --

     He gets up, she watches him dress and leave --




53   He drives over the Triborough Bridge.                           53


               As, as far as I could see, people
               were always conning each other to
               get what they wanted. We even con
               ourselves.





55   He drives through the suburb of ranch houses and driveways      55

56   and pulls into his driveway of his split-level ranch. Irv       56
     gets out of his Cadillac and walks to the front door of his
     house --


               We talk ourselves into things. We
               sell ourselves things we maybe
               don't even need or want by dressing
               them up. We leave out the risk. We
               leave out the ugly truth.




     Irv walks into the decorated ranch house, frosted glass with
     bird designs, glass tables, walls, black and brown lacquer
     everywhere. He walks into the house and looks at a picture
     his son did -- a drawing of the Yankees playing baseball --
     that is taped to the refrigerator.


               Pay attention to that because we're
               all conning ourselves in one way or
               another just to get through life.

     Irv takes Danny's picture from the fridge and tip toes --
     with low sounds now of O.S. TV -- Irv goes to A CLOSED DOOR
     WITH YANKEE STICKERS on it --

     Irv OPENS A BEDROOM DOOR TO REVEAL HIS 5 YEAR OLD SON, DANNY.


               He was married, and he had a son.




     DANNY is on the bed, picture books, baseball cards, spread
     all around him. Irv stands holding the picture. Danny looks
     over his shoulder.


               He had adopted her son.







               He was a really good dad and I
               respected him for that. It was a
               tough situation for everyone.

     Irv's face lights up.


               Danny. This is a fantastic
               picture. What did you do today?


               That kid Donovan is being mean to
               me.


               The big kid? I thought Mommy picked
               you up so he couldn't bother you.


               She was late, and then after we put
               out the fire, mommy said stay in my
               room with my baseball cards.

     Danny reaches across to Irving and takes his glasses off his
     face and puts them on.


               What fire?


               Did you know they make a lamp that
               has the sun in it? [Irv looks at
               him] Mommy got the lamp. She made
               her special drink and the lamp made
               a fire.

     Irv looks concerned.




     Irv's wife Rosalyn sits up on the bed in a muumuu, half her
     face is burned.


               I put out the fire. The fire is
               out.


               For the first time in my life I do
               the right thing.




Oh shut up --


I save a young single mother, and
her kid. I marry her. I adopt him -



You fell in love! Don't forget we
fell madly in love!


Yes, I fell in love. My God, I
fell in love. Yes. But you know
what? I thought you were
mysterious like my mother until it
turned out that mysterious just
meant depressed, hard to reach. I
mean, I'm dying here! And you need
somebody who's gonna be quiet like
you. You're young, you're
beautiful. You gotta find somebody
else. You gotta go out and get
some friends all right? Don't sit
inside --


I don't like going out. You know
that I get anxiety when I have to
meet people. You know how hard that
is.


Yeah but you can't just stay in the
house with the fucking sun lamp.
Alright? And I can't-- I mean,
look, I can't trust you with it
anyway. That fire and everything. I
can't trust to leave you with
Danny.


I put the fire out Irving! There is
no fire! Maybe if you were here
more, then there wouldn't have been
a fire in the first place.


Oh, what, there wouldn't have been
a fire if I was here?




          Just stop with the whole fire
          thing. God it was a mistake. I'm
          sure a million people do that all
          the time. Those sun lamps are
          dangerous. Shouldn't even have them
          in the house, really. I bet that
          happens all the time. This was
          nothing.


          We're not happy. Alright?

Rosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying
nothing.


          You know that I could take Danny.
          You know that most of your work is
          illegal. And you know that if you
          tried to divorce me, you know that--
          I'm not saying that I would, but
          I'm saying that I could. And I'm
          saying that that is why I don't
          like divorce, Irving. Women do that
          in divorces. Women get the
          children, and then the fathers
          never see them. My mother never got
          divorced. My grandmother never got
          divorced. There are NO divorces in
          my family. I am not getting a
          divorce.


          Come on. What are we doing here?


          We fight and we fuck and that's
          what we do. That's our thing.


          She was the Piccaso of passive
          aggressive karate. She was better
          than any con artist I'd ever met
          including myself. And she had me
          like nobody had me.


Rosalyn sheds her muumuu, to reveal a white leotard.


          Irving, come to mama. Come on.




               You might say she was my karma for
               how I took advantage of people.


               Irving, come here. Come on. Get
               into bed.


               Alright.


63             Baby, there's such good stuff here.                    63







               I did not want to leave the kid
               behind. He was my son. She had me.
               I was her mark.











     WE NOW SEE THE MARK: A charismatic, mercurial, wild eyed
     BUSINESSMAN "MORT PAPIERMAN" in need of a loan.

     Mort's eyes go from her knees to her eyes -- His eyes meet
     Sydney's -- he looks soulful, open. She stares at him. Irv
     notices uncomfortably. He's JEALOUS.


               -- and every deal I take, I close.
               However, my fee is non refundable,
               just like my time.


                   
               I want to thank you very much
               Irving for seeing me. Sorry I'm so
               nervous.

     Richie reaches for his top button to adjust it.




          Am I not buttoned?

Edith stares at him and smiles.


          I just gotta say Mr. Rosenfeld,
          that Lady Edith was very adamant
          that you were top notch and --


          That's correct.


          I really need your help. I'm
          desperate. I've got the Audis for
          collateral and the two boats, and I
          forgot to mention that I have a
          little piece of real estate in Long
          Island.


          No, you didn't mention that. Two
          lunches and you never mentioned
          that.


          Oh, I was gonna mention it and then
          the guy with the hat walked in.


          The hat.


          And I forgot totally. It was the
          second time we had lunch.


          You couldn't see his eyes. He had
          no eyes. It was like, did he make
          it?


              
          Do they sell hats like that? Where
          do they come from? Actually, I went
          to the store that I thought maybe
          he bought it there. I was gonna get
          you one --


          You were going to get me one?




          Like as a memento.

Irving decides to interject.


          Two lunches?


          Yes. It's two lunches. What's the
          big deal?


          That's unusual.


          I was trying to get him to be more
          aggressive. On his loan that is.

                    Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          You showed me a whole new side of
          the city I'd never seen before.


          Oh, good. You're welcome.

                    Mort PAPIERMAN/RICHIE DIMASO
          No, thank you.


          Yeah, right. You liked it? Should I
          take you there?


          Yes.



          Should I take you there twice?



          Stop.





              
          What's going on, you like this guy?


          Yes I like this guy.




          Is that messing up your judgement?
          Don't be stupid.


          No, he's not messing with my
          judgment.


          Hey, play your part.


          Fine. You play your part.


              
          Take it to your people in London.
          Please, take it to them. I got the
          cashier's check right here. I give
          you five and you give me fifty
          right back, right? Please. Please
          don't reject me. Give a guy a
          chance.



THE AIR UNCOMFORTABLY AWKWARDLY UNTIL -- almost in slow
motion --Edith takes the check -- staring at Mort. IRV STARTS



          Zurich? You got an office in
          Zurich? Paris? I can call Paris?


          If you could excuse me for one
          second?


          Yeah, take your time. Do whatever
          you need to do. Go ahead, take your
          time.






AS Edith OPENS A SIDE DOOR -- BANG - FEDERAL AGENT STOCK



          You got the wrong office, you're
          gonna be embarrassed.









               I may not have you, Irving, but I
               have her on fraud. Impersonating
               another individual.


               Fraud?! Fraud? What is that?
               Identity fraud?





               You may be from England, Edith, but
               you're not royal and you have no
               banking connections and that's a
               felony. How long is that? That's 3-
               5 years I think.


                   
               Hey! Not so tight!


               Oh really? That's interesting. I
               don't even know your real name.

     Richie pulls out a badge and shoves it in Irving's face.


               Richie Dimaso, FBI. Nice to meet
               you.

     Richie looks at Edith with concern and points at Irving.


               You gotta get away from this guy.

     Agents take boxes of files out of the office- Irv standing
     alone in center of room- shell-shocked.









               He wouldn't let me see her for
               three days. He even managed to
               delay a lawyer.




     Dim cell, lit only from small high barred window, no lights
     on. Edith looks like she's coming apart -- circles under her
     eyes, a shadow of her confident self -- pale, scared, hair
     flat, stringy, unglamourous, pacing, rocking.


65             She couldn't handle it.                               65




     FLUORESCENT LIGHTS COME ON IN THE CELL -- Edith squints. Cell
     is unlocked by Richie Dimaso WHO enters with a cup and saucer
     of tea. He stands near her with the tea.


                   (to the other side of the
                    two-way mirror)
               Joe, how come the fluorescents are
               on? Can we kill that, please? (to
               Syd) Jesus I put this lamp here for
               you 'cause I thought it'd be better
               for you. There's a wire here.
               They're scared because people hang
               themselves but I know you're too
               smart for that. Where's the table
               and chair? There's no bed here?
               It's like a fucking asylum. Joe, is
               everybody off today? Jesus Christ
               it's scary. Maybe I wanted to scare
               you. I don't know. Maybe it was my
               idea. Maybe i'm a little off the
               beaten path you know? I don't know.
               You look dehydrated. Here, want to
               try some tea? Oh yeah, your lips
               are all chapped.  It's
               herbal. My favorite.

     Richie bends down to Edith who is sitting on the floor in the
     corner and hands her the cup and saucer. She lifts the cup
     but her hand is shaking almost violently as she raises the
     cup to her lips.


               I know you think -- look at me.
               Hey. Edith.




          I know you think Irv loves you. I
          know you think you know him -- that
          he sees the world as a cold, dark
          place, and he cares about nobody
          but very few people on his short
          list: his son, his father, Rosalyn,
          and you. And you think you're at
          the top of that list. But what if
          you're not. What if you're not even
          on the list at all? He'd be in
          here right now if he took the
          check.

She thinks about this. She trembles.


          He'd be in here right now if he
          took the check. But no, you did.
          God, it's, it's so clear to me.
          It's so crazy -- it's clear to me,
          but it's not clear to you. He uses
          you, Edith, to protect himself. To
          protect his son and his wife in
          Long Island. No? Yes. He put a
          ring on her finger, he adopted her
          son. They have huge house, they
          have two cars. What does she do all
          day? I'll tell you what she does --
          she plays with her nails, she
          watches T.V., and she spends your
          money, the money that you make.

Edith stares at Richie, taking this in.


          I don't like that you're in jail
          while he's going free. I don't
          like any of that. I want to help
          you. All the razzle-dazzle that he
          does, it's not good. It's not real.
          It's fake. It's not real. Who you
          are is who you are, between you and
          God. You and your soul. That's what
          matters. That's what counts.
          That's what I'm about. And that's
          what I see in you. Tell me you
          didn't feel it the first time we
          saw each other. Am I crazy? I don't
          think so. I'm not supposed to be
          talking like this, but I don't
          care, I break the rules.

Edith looks at Richie in silence as she thinks about what
he's saying.




               Okay, Edith? Edith. I want to help
               you. I like you.  I like
               you.  I like you.




     Irv stands alone on the other side of the glass staring at
     Sydney.

     Richard Dimaso walks in.


               Been in there three days. Hasn't
               been so good for her.

     Irv continues to stare at Sydney.


               How does that make you feel her in
               there? That check was for you,
               right? But you knew somethin' was
               off. That's 'cause you're good.
               You're, like, the best at what you
               do in the whole country, aren't
               you?

     Irv looks at him.


               But you know what? If the country
               were run by people like you, Irving
               Rosenfeld we'd be living in Eastern
               Europe or Guatemala. You ever been
               in Guatemala? You ever been in jail
               in Guatemala? You ever try to get a
               telephone or a permit or anything
               in Guatemala? That's what this
               country would be like if we let
               people, let the liars like you, run
               this country.


               Who made you god and judge?


               My grandmother lived to be ninety-
               three years old. Never lied in her
               life.


               Congratulations.




               Thank you. I'm proud of that, too.
               Does that make her not a good
               person? Is that not something to
               strive for?


               Why you breaking my balls? Get to
               the point.


               I see something in you, Irving. I
               get very excited. I think that we
               have a lot of potential here. Now,
               look. I came up with the idea.
               It's all from me. I want to change
               things. I want to go after white
               collar crime. Irving, you're very
               skilled. And I want you to teach me
               and we can do this. I want four
               people that do what you do.
               Fraudulent investments. Fake
               certificates of deposit. Stolen
               art, fake art. You get me four
               people and you're off the hook.


               Four busts and you'll leave us
               alone? We don't have to testify?


               You're good, you're done. Anything
               you want. But if you run, then your
               life is over. You'll be hunted, and
               it's gonna be very difficult for
               Rosalyn and your kid to live in
               this country.




     A NICE UPPER EAST SIDE apartment. Sydney has finally changed
     her clothing from when she wore the same dress at the holding
     cell. It is quiet in the apartment - faint street noise from
     3rd Avenue below.


               We need to leave. We need to run
               and we need to do it now. We can go
               to Estonia or Romania, I don't
               care, we'll take the cash from the
               bed and get out of here, alright?
               We talked about it a hundred times.



Irv stares at her and struggles.


          What about Danny?


          What about Danny?


          I adopted him! I gave him my name!
          I'm not leaving him with Rosalyn,
          she's unstable!


          That's a manipulation! Rosalyn's
          will never let you go. She'll use
          Danny against you because she's too
          messed up to let you leave.


          I can't leave him. I love him.
          Alright? He's my son.


          Richie said you would say that.


          Richie? What, the cop? Your on a
          first name basis with him?


          Yes I am. I'm not even on your list
          am I?


          What list?


          Your list. Your short list. Your
          long list. I'm not even on anyone
          of your fucking lists. I thought
          you loved me. I thought we had
          something.


          We do have something. I love you,
          it's perfect! What are you saying?
          We're gonna go to Romania? We're
          gonna take Danny?


          Yes. Yes, that's what I'm saying.
          You, me, Danny.




          Well you never said that before.


          I'm saying it now. We're us, and we
          can make it an adventure like we
          did. We can make it an adventure
          like we make everything, alright?
          But we have to go now. We have to
          leave right now.


          I can't leave Danny. I'll lose
          custody.


          You have to take me away! We have
          to leave!


              
          What are you saying?! Oh my god.



          What are you doing?! Please!

Sydney goes storming out of the room and down the hall of her
apartment. Irving follows.


          I can't believe this is happening.


          Don't say I don't love you because
          that's bullshit!


              
          This is bullshit. You are bullshit.
          We are bullshit.

She starts sobbing, shaking.


          Please don't do this.


          I just never thought you were
          conning me.


          I could never con you. I love you.
          Please don't say this.



Irv walks to her and bends down to join her on the floor as
she sobs.


          No, I'm done.


          Don't say that.


              
          I'm gonna do these four busts,
          these four cons, to get us out of
          this. Not just me, but us. And
          I'm gonna get really close with
          Richie, the cop, in case we need to
          use him, if we need another move.


          We don't need another move. We need
          four busts, and we're done.


          We are going to need another move,
          trust me. And you're going to be
          thanking me. (shifts to British
          accent) The key to people is what
          they believe and what they want to
          believe and I want to believe that
          we were real, and I want to believe
          that a man could want me. And I'm
          gonna take all of that heartbreak,
          and all of that sorrow, and I am
          going to use it. And I'm going to
          make Richie think that I want him,
          and that I like him, and I'm going
          to be very convincing -- And I'm
          pissed at you.

Sydney reaches over and carefully grabs Irving's face
lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on.


          Because I'm pissed at you!

Irving stares at Sydney with confusion. He's never seen her
like this before.


          Maybe I do like him -- Maybe I like
          him a lot. From the feet up right --
          baby?

Sydney gets up from the couch and storms back to her room.




               Quite your belly aching and come up
               with something to get us out of
               this. And you're right -- I'm in no
               state to deal with this so what's
               it gonna be, Mister Mastermind?




69             An Arab sheik? Why do we need an                      69
               Arab Sheik?




     Richie, in sharp lapeled suit, chain on his neck, walks with
     Irv and Edith and joined by a man who looks like an ARAB
     SHEIK who they trail.


               How do you think this works,
               stupid?


               If you could not call him `stupid'
               which he's isn't, he's smarter than
               you. Last I checked he's in control
               here and we work for him now so be
               nice.

     Richie stares at Edith elated that she just stuck up for him.
     He's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him
     in.


                   
               OK, to set this up and bust a con
               artist we have to make the honey
               pot to attract the bees. In order
               to attract the bees, we need to
               offer them a wealthy individual who
               can be taken advantage of, someone
               special, someone new, someone
               amazing. Then those guys will want
               to sell fake bank CDS to THAT guy,
               take the sheik's money, see?

     Richie looks at Irving uncertain.


               Only they can't get into his money
               unless you they know someone, and
               that someone is us.




          Oh that's good.


          So if you want to get somebody like
          your con artist friend -- Carl
          Elway -- you get him to want to buy-



          Keep your voice down.


          -- or sell fake art or stolen art
          or fake certificates of deposit, he
          needs -- who does he need? -- he
          needs a rich sheik guy, and there
          you go -- we can pinch him!


          Right, but I don't tell Elway shit.
          I wait for him to call me. The art
          world is a small world -- and one
          of Elway's acquaintances is
          clocking us right now.

Richie starts to look around.


          Where?


          Don't look.

Richie looks anyway and sees ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE, a man
balding, 45 clocking them from the balcony.


          You have a good look?


          How do you know the Sheik?


          This is my friend Al from Queens.


          I do aluminum siding and roofing.

Richie stares, impressed.





Irving, Edith, Richie, and the fake Sheik admire a REMBRANDT
painting on the wall.


          I want to show you something. This
          Rembrandt here? People come from
          all over the world to see this.


          Yeah, he's good.


          It's a fake.


          Wait, what're you talking about?
          That's impossible.


          People believe what they want to
          believe. Cause the guy who made
          this was so good that it's real to
          everybody. Now whose the master --
          the painter or the forger?

Richie's continues to stare at the REMBRANDT on the wall.


          That's a fake?


          That's the way the world works. Not
          black and white as you say.
          Extremely grey.

ELWAY'S ACQUAINTANCE walks up to Irving and the group and
steps into the conversation.


          Irving can I --


          How many times I gotta tell you.
          You can't meet the sheik, alright?

Edith sees this and steps into the conversation.


          Arthur? Hi. Edith. We've met
          before.




                I wanted to introduce you to Robert
                Spencer. We're advising the Sheik
                together.

      She looks at Richie. Richie offers his hand.


                    
                Yeah, I'm Robert Spencer, advisor
                to the sheik.







      CARL ELWAY, 40, preppie Waspy, very old fashioned with
      cigarette holder, but something vaguely criminal about him,
      in his conservative suit, natty white and red striped shirt,
      and navy blue tie sits with Irving.


                What's this I hear about a god damn
                Sheik?! Why you leaving me out of
                this? I gotta hear about it from my
                friends?


                It ain't for you Carl.


                What do you mean it ain't for me?
                We gotta do certificates of
                deposit. I can print as many as you
                need.


                This is not a one man operation.


                Look, I can get other guys. What
                are you talking about Irving?


                You're telling me that you can get
                four guys to sell fake certificates
                of deposit to my investor within a
                week?

      The camera zooms into Irving's shirt collar revealing a tiny
      microphone.




          Yes I can make that happen. Carl
          Elway can do what he says he's
          going to do.


          That's interesting but you know
          I've got other guys lined up. I've
          got a meeting with my associates.


Richie Dimaso and Edith ARE STANDING THERE -- MUCH TO IRV'S



          Carl, his associates are here. He's
          got a meeting he's got to go to.


          No wait. Don't go anywhere.


          I've got to go.

Irving gets up to walk out as Richie and Edith stand in the
doorway.


          Crazy thing about people -- the
          more you say no, the more they want
          in on somethin. It is so stupid.


Irving looks over at Richie and Edith.


          I'll tell them, don't worry. Hey
          you know what Carl just told me? He
          said he could do this whole thing
          with four guys within a week.


          Or we could do somethin' much
          bigger!

Richie jumps into the conversation.


          Something bigger? My guy deals with
          hundreds of millions of dollars.
          How much bigger?

He walks over to Carl.




          Hundreds of million -- I knew you
          were holdin' out on me Irving!
          Hundreds of millions of dollars?
          Like much bigger. Like I'm talking
          about we say never the fuck mind
          the CD's and we could have some
          complete access to something huge.


          Huge? Like what? (introducing
          himself) Robert Spencer, advisor to
          the Sheik.


          Carl Elway.

Irv stares at Richie with contempt, then turns to Edith,



          I want you to think of the most
          undervalued asset in the state of
          New Jersey today. The rebuilding of
          Atlantic City.

Richie looks over at Irving and Sydney and mouths the word



          Look, maybe they, maybe they
          legalized gambling a year ago but
          nothing's happening.

Irving interjects.


          Hey, quit while you're ahead Carl.


          I know the guy. I know the right
          people who are going to help you
          out.


          Whose the guy?


          The guy is Carmine Polito.


          Whose Carmine Polito?





     PUSH IN: STODDARD THORSEN, Richie's FBI supervisor.


                   
               Carmine Polito? Carmine Polito, no.

     We freeze frame on Stoddard as we HEAR Richie'S VO:

     AS Richie TALKS WE SEE A SHORT FILM ABOUT Carmine Polito:

     - PUSH IN: Mayor Polito walks a Camden street waves, shakes
     hands of WELL-WISHERS


               My boss Stoddard proceeded to tell
               me that Carmine Polito was the most
               quietly powerful person in the
               state of New Jersey. A lifetime
               native of the very racially mixed
               Camden, which had become a ghetto,
               and where he had been Mayor for ten
               years. A very beloved guy. A guy
               who never gave up on his people.
               His father had emigrated from Italy
               and had stoked coal.

     - Frank Sinatras COFFEE SONG, 1940s version, as we see
     Carmine talk to and dance joyfully with his kids and wife at
     breakfast.



               A big family guy with five kids.
               They even adopted some other kid.
               A black kid from the Boys and Girls
               Club who'd lost his family. I mean,
               his household was a joyous place.
               And his wife Dolly, she was the
               apple of his eye and the center of
               the household. I mean everyone
               loved this guy.

     - PULL OUT Mayor Polito walks up steps of City Hall as he
     greets a women and her baby; into his office greeted by a
     couple of AIDES who show him papers to sign.


               And he had a huge heart.






                   
               The W.P.A. employed craftsmen to
               paint this during the Depression.
               Why can't we employ people today to
               do work like this in rebuilding
               Atlantic City?


               He worked with all the unions. He
               was the leader of the State
               Assembly. And he had just gotten
               gambling legalized in New Jersey to
               create jobs.

80   -- FLOOR OF STATE ASSEMBLY -- Carmine huddles with other       80
     STATE LEGISLATORS, horsetrading and then poses for a picture
     with other members of the State Assembly.


               But he couldn't get the funds to
               rebuild Atlantic City and that was
               his problem. So with our help, he
               was about to have his hand in the
               wrong pocket at the wrong time.
               And to me that meant corrupt




               You said grifters and con artists.
               We're not going after some
               politician. This is a bad idea,
               Richard.


               Shhhh. Look, it's really simple.
               All you need is to put two million
               in a Chase account --


               What?!


               -- under the Sheik's name --


               Whose two million?!




          Shh, just listen. Two million
          dollars under the Sheik's name, in
          a Chase account that we control.
          Carmine calls up on the telephone --
          calls the bank -- and he sees that
          the Sheik is real and he has a real
          account. Five days.


          I'm not taking two million dollars
          of the taxpayers' money and putting
          it anywhere for five days, I don't
          care if we control it the whole
          time.

Richie as he stares at Stoddard in frustration.


          Stoddard, let us do what we need to
          do to rule out corruption and to
          get rid of the payoff guys that are
          ruining this country. That's my
          dream. Don't smother it, please.


          You know Richard, I understand your
          eagerness. I really do. You know
          I'm from Michigan, right? Let me
          tell you a story about me, and my
          dad, and my brother. We used to go
          ice fishing every November. Ice
          Fishing. That's what we lived for.


          Holy shit --


          Just listen to me. It's beautiful.
          You have a little stove. You huddle
          around, you keep each other warm.
          You drop a line and you just wait.
          One year my brother says, "let's go
          in October." He wants to go ice
          fishing in October. My dad says,
          "No, the ice is too thin." My
          brother says -- I love my brother
          he says --




               I understand what's happening.
               You're saying your brother went out
               on the ice, the ice was too thin,
               he fell through the ice, he went in
               the water because he was too eager,
               and you're saying I'm too eager --
               that's what you're saying?


               No, that's not what I'm saying.


               What are you saying?


               We'll finish the ice fishing story
               another time, young man. For now,
               no Carmine Polito. Go do your job.

     Richie looks at him annoyed and upset.


               Stoddard shot the whole thing down.


               Boring.


               But Edith was a genius.

83   SEE B-ROLL OF: Edith and Richie walk back into FBI building,   83

84   down corridor;                                                 84


               She somehow found this woman who
               controlled the wire room. A woman
               I'd never heard of. Way back in a
               warren buried in the Bureau. This
               cat lady nobody even talked to.
               Edith met her in the ladies room
               and became friends with her. This
               lady handled all the wires and now,
               she was working with us.




85   Edith and Richie enter to find BRENDA, FBI, MATRONLY, OLDER;   85
     EDITH carries a basket of exotic teas;




          She was excited to be included in
          an operation instead of being on
          the other end of a memo. It was
          beautiful.

Edith goes to hand her the PIMMS CUP and basket of teas.


          Brenda, hi!


          Hi!


          You said you liked exotic food, so
          that's from England.


          That's from England?


          That's right. And I brought you
          some tea as well.


          Thank you so much! Nobody ever
          tells me about these operations,
          they just say, "Brenda, do the
          clerical wiring work and don't ask
          questions."


          You need to tell Richie about your
          cats. He loves them.


          Oh my cats?!

Brenda starts pointing out pictures of all her cats tacked to
the walls amidst the wire memos and paperwork.


          Well that's Harry -- look at him
          standing up, isn't that sweet? And
          that's Wendy. She's a rascal. But
          Barnaby, that's another story.
          Barnaby plays the piano!


          That's impressive.




               We got her to wire two million
               dollars into an F.B.I.-controlled
               account at Chase. It'd be there
               for five days and if Polito called
               he'd see that the Sheik was real.




     Edith and Richie laugh excitedly as they walk the hallways.


               By the time Stoddard caught up to
               us Edith made sure his boss was
               impressed by my idea. So before he
               even knew it was happening his boss
               was calling to congratulate him.





               I'm very impressed. That was very
               smart. The Sheik with the money in
               the bank is a fantastic...don't be
               modest.


               Anthony Amado. He was the U.S.
               Attorney, and he had a major hard-
               on to make a name for himself. I
               mean this guy loved the idea of
               being famous. And Stoddard had to
               say it was his own idea or he'd
               look stupid in front of his boss.




89   PUSH IN ON STODDARD -- confused, dismayed.                    89


               Thank you, sir, wait, the sheik --




     He hangs up, pissed, confused.




               You made me accept praise from my
               boss who's thanking me for
               something that never shoulda
               happened! Something that I didn't
               approve!


               You should be happy. There's
               imaginative things happening in
               this office, alright? We're not
               just working in a box.

     Richie leaves triumphant.


               We got the two million to put
               Carmine and the Sheik together.


               Punk.




     Laughing Richie and Edith walk briskly on their way out.


               I liked being on this side of the
               line. But someone had been left
               out.





               We succeeded because we stayed
               small. I got you Carl Elway. He
               bought stolen art, sold fake bank
               C.D.'s, that's enough. That's one.
               I get you three more -- no
               politicians.

     Richie and Edith look at him.


               You're gonna do this because you
               got no choice. You work for me.


               Now you keep changing the rules.
               You're gettin' a little power
               drunk, Richard.




You want to tell him, Edith? You
want to wake him up?


Oh no, I said we shouldn't do any
of it, Irving. You know I said
that. So now I support Richie.
He's got vision. Do it heavy or
don't do it.


I mean, he's the one ruining
America, not me.


How the hell am I ruining America?


Because people just got over
Watergate and Vietnam, alright?
And you're gonna shit all over
politicians again? And just because
you want to be a big shot and get a
promotion.


No I'm thinking big. This is gonna
be fantastic. We're doing video
surveillance. I'm doing this from
the feet up.


You will never do it properly
because you got too much government
attitude to be small and sleek.
I'm like the fuckin' Vietcong, man.
I'm in and I'm out. I was there the
whole time -- you don't know it.
That's the fucking art of becoming
somebody who people can pin their
beliefs and their dreams on. And
you can't do it.


How about a suite at the Sheraton
Hotel?


For Carmine Polito and rebuilding
Atlantic City?


Why not?




          You need a luxury hotel for the
          Sheik. Come on!


          Carmine does back door dealings all
          the time. We don't have a budget
          for that Irving!


          You gotta knock the Mayor, the
          Speaker of the State Assembly --
          you gotta knock him off of his
          fucking feet. He's gotta feel like
          he's out of his league. What you're
          offering, this deal, I mean, this
          is unheard of in the state of New
          Jersey, maybe even the whole
          fucking country. A sheik with
          hundreds of millions of dollars to
          rebuild Atlantic City -- are you
          fuckin' kidding me? That's
          gigantic. And the Mayor, he's going
          to want to see cash, he's going to
          want to see it in an account, he's
          going to want to see it right now,
          and he will check. And that's why
          this meeting isn't happening,
          because to get millions, you need
          millions.

Edith listens intently.


              
          We already did it.


              
          What?

Irv studies Richie and Edith.


          We got the bureau to park 2 million
          for three days -- we got the
          account numbers.


          `We' meaning you and him?


          Yeah we did it.




          Really?


          Yeah, me and that guy.


          She showed me.


          You showed him our thing? You did
          that without me? Are you kidding
          me?


          What are you going to do?








          You playing me? Are we doing this?
          Or you playing him? It'd be very
          bad for you if you're playing me.


          You're going to have to decide for
          yourself, kid, I just laid
          everything out on the table.


          This is all very exciting, I never
          knew life could be like this.
          You're wild. You know we're taking
          down a very important politician.

Richie stands very close to Edith - between her legs as she
sits on the counter. He puts his hands on her hips, pulls
her into him. He takes her hand -- puts it on his face,
makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand. It is
intense. She prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back.
They are both excited. They stare at each other. The air is
thick with tension, Richie exhales and leaves.


              




                 This is agent Richard Dimaso, I'm
                 placing $75,000 into this briefcase
                 for Mayor Carmine Polito to procure
                 casino license and building permits
                 for Atlantic City.






     Where the film started --

     See RICHIE TALK TO CAMERA IN A CORNER OF THE PLAZA SUITE--




     IRVING'S EYES WIDEN AS WE CUT TO: Richie SLIDE THE BRIEFCASE
     OF CASH, AS SEEN BEFORE, Edith puts her hand on top of
     Richie's to stop him.








     Carmine Polito, upset, storms down the street as Irving
     catches up.


                 Mr. Mayor -- Please stop. Listen, I
                 apologize if that prick offended
                 you. I really apologize.

     Carmine will not turn around -- Irving catches up.


                 Really, I'm all right, thank you.
                 I'm okay.


                 No. I'm fucking embarrassed to be
                 associated with that guy at all.
                 Can I just say somethin' to you,
                 please? Don't lose this opportunity
                 to fuckin' Florida -- all right? --
                 because of some bullshit from that
                 punk advisor with his diploma who
                 could never get into the school
                 that we come from. Don't lose that
                 opportunity.




          Where you from?


          I'm from the Bronx. Grand
          Concourse, Hundred and Sixty-fourth
          Street.




          I got a lot of friends that live up
          there. I go to Tomaso's on Arthur
          Avenue. You know Tomasos's?


          Yeah, Tomaso's.


          The spicy clams.


          Yes. They're always good.


          Oh, they're to fucking die for,
          those clams. I haven't been there
          in a while. I like that place.


          Carmine -- can I call you Carmine?
          You know, Carmine -- (catches his
          breath) My fuckin' heart's going
          from running down the stairs -- I'm
          not used to running. There's a
          lotta green grass in that hotel
          room up there, alright? And all the
          deals would float through you. You
          get a serious piece on both ends.
          You do with that what you will. I
          live in the real world, I am a
          family man, I got mouths to feed
          and everything. But, you know, we
          just...we gotta grease you
          directly. No middlemen, no
          bullshit. It's the Arab way.


          Yeah, look, I understand. It's a
          great opportunity. It's just I got
          a little thrown by going to have a
          meeting with somebody who ended up
          not being there, so --




               Hey, listen, I was thrown as well.


               I understand. I'll deal with you
               directly. I don't want any
               middleman or any of that bullshit.


               Done.


               I like you. Eye to eye. We can do
               business together.

     Irv smiles and nods as they walk back into the hotel
     together.


               How long do you know this guy? You
               work with this guy before?


               I gotta work with him. He's the
               Sheik's man.


               But I still need to meet the Sheik,
               okay?


               Done.





               I'm going out to dinner with
               Carmine and the wives in Camden.


               Who?


               Carmine and myself and the wives.


               What?! Without me?!




He doesn't like you, what do you
want from me, I got him to come
back and take the money and you got
him on tape alright? I can't make
him like you. I did my job.


Did you tell him you were working
with me? That I'm the Sheik's
associate?!


I just fucking told you he doesn't
like you. I mean, let him have a
night out with a human being for
fuck's sake, he's going to jail
soon. You're done with him. You got
him on tape taking a bribe.


Carmine has got to deal with me,
Irving.


We're gonna use Carmine. We're
gonna use Carmine to get other
people, that's what we're gonna do.


What?! Like who?!


Carmine's gonna use the Sheik to
pay off people.


Are you fuckin' nuts? What are you
say--


We're gonna let Carmine show the
Sheik Atlantic City, how he's gonna
renovate hotels, and see who shows
up. Whoever the Sheik pays off for
licenses and casinos, that's who
we're gonna go after. We're gonna
go after all of 'em!


More politicians? You realize how
fuckin' dangerous that is? There's
no fucking reasoning with you.




               Edith and I were so successful for
               so long because we kept it just
               small enough. You are takin' us to
               a very fucking dangerous place,
               with very serious numbers!


               If your that successful, how come
               you wound up in this room with me?
               Taking orders from me.


               You're taking your wife out to
               dinner? Your fucking wife? Did I
               just hear you correctly?


               That's the one thing you heard me
               say?


               I just find it rather shocking
               that's all.


               I get to handle two wives with one
               dinner, alright? I take Rosalyn
               out, she keeps her mouth shut, she
               sees that my work is legitimate, I
               get to keep my kid, and I get to
               keep  that
               fucking wife happy. Both wives
               happy.




     Sydney sits alone in her apartment, hair in curlers and
     sparks a joint.




     Richie sits in his bathroom, his hair in tight curlers, as he
     eats a chicken wing.


               Richard! What are you doing? Don't
               eat in the bathroom, I told you so
               many times! And Diane brought
               Napoleons for dessert. Come out of
               the bathroom and pray!







               Oh my god, what did you do?







               Richard, the filter is broken in
               the fish tank. It's a problem.


               See, your job is to do the filter,
               Mom, mine is to do the gravel.
               When you don't do the filter right
               all the fish die. See?


               I can't get the top on that filter.


               I've gone over this a hundred times
               mom --







               -- and please help Richard to marry
               Diane so that I may have
               grandchildren and the Pope may have
               more followers. And please bless
               this food that we are about to eat -






               Yeah, hello?




               Hi.


               Who's this?




It's Edith.


Sit down and pray properly!



Are you alright?


Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just alone, you
know? Irving's out with Carmine.


That's right, he went out with
Carmine and his wife. You must not
feel so good about that.


Richard, sit down!


Wait who's there? Who are you with?


Oh, no, it's just people.


People? I'm your fiance! Richard!


Oh, you've got a fiance. You're
engaged.


Well, I don't know, no fiance.    I
don't know.


You don't know if you have a
fiance?


I don't know --


You don't know? You don't know if
you have a fiance?


The fish filter is broken!




               I don't. No.


               Hmm -- intersting.


               Hey, you want to get together?


               Richard, do something about the
               fish tank.


               Fifty-fourth Street?


               OK, fifty-fourth street.











               That's what that phone call's
               about. Everybody thought, "Oh,
               Richie DiMaso's gonna stay in the
               office, pushing papers." That's
               not gonna happen, Mom. I'm outside
               in the field. I got people working
               for me. My ideas. I'm running the
               show. I'm the quarterback. And I'm
               not gonna settle for no one, Mom.





98   Ext. BARON'S ITALIAN RESTAURANT- CAMDEN- NIGHT                  98



     SLOW MOTION: Carmine and DOLLY POLITO  get
     out of his maroon Lincoln Town car.

     Irv and Rosalyn Rosenfeld get out of his green Cadillac. SOME








      Ella continues. Mixture of LOCALS: ITALIANS, POLISH, BLACKS
      AND PUERTO RICANS -- wave to the mayor from the bar, and
      tables, as Irv and Rosalyn follow.




                Rocco, you know like we do. The
                chicken very thin. You should see
                the way he does this chicken with
                the red sauce


                It's beautiful.


                Right? With the red sauce, the
                lemon--

      Dolly kisses Carmine as he gives his wife's leg a squeeze and
      kisses her cheek, then her mouth.

      Irv and Rosalyn squeeze hands on the table. SHE KNOCKS BACK A
      GLASS OF RED WINE as a plate of Chicken Picatta is served to
      the table.


                It's the Piccata of the gods!

      She pulls away awkwardly, waiter refills her glass which she
      throws back right away. Irv looks concerned.

      They all drink.

101   CUT TO - LATER: Carmine and Irving talk.                        101


                I believe that you should treat
                people the way that you want to be
                treated.


                Right.


                Didn't Jesus say that or something?


                He may have.




          Also, always take a favor over
          money. I think Jesus said that as
          well.


               
          I don't know if he said the second
          one but he may have said the first
          one.

CUT TO -- Rosalyn DRUNKENLY LEANS IN TALKING TO Dolly POLITO


              
          I chip them moving furniture, it's
          my obsession -- Moving, re-
          decorating, it makes me feel better
          like exercise. There's this top
          coat that you can only get from
          Switzerland and I don't know what
          I'm going to do because I'm running
          out of it but I LOVE the smell of
          it.


          I can get that for you, of course.


          There's something, the topcoat,
           it's like perfumey
          but there's also something rotten?
          I know that sounds crazy, but I
          can't get enough of it.

Dolly laughs.


          No, smell it. It's true. Dolly,
          historically the best perfumes in
          the world, they're all laced with
          something nasty and foul. It's
          true!

She puts it under Irv's nose as he talks to Carmine, he
sniffs, closes his eyes, nods without even looking.


          Irving loves them. He can't get
          enough of them.


          I can't get enough.




              
          Carmine, sweet and sour. Rotten and
          delicious.

She leans across the table and puts them under Carmine's
nose.


          Smells like flowers.


          Flowers, but with garbage.


          You know what that is for me? It's
          coriander for me.


          Irving loves it. He can't get
          enough. That's what hooks you. He
          always comes back for it.


          I can't stop.


              
          He's gonna say we have to talk
          business in five, four, three, two,
          one --


              
          Dolly, can me and the mayor talk
          business here?


              


Carmine and Dolly rush to grab Rosalyn; JULIUS, Carmine's
steadfast AIDE, BLACK, 40, BIG SIDEBURNS, LOOSENED TIE and
white shirtsleeves, BIG SMILE, helps.


          No, don't do that it makes me look
          more drunk than I am! I'm not this
          drunk. Irving please don't make me
          go, I was just starting to have
          fun!

She WOBBLES INTO ARMS OF his WIFE Dolly, she and Carmine help
guide Rosalyn out.





      Todd Rundgren's "I Saw the Light" plays somewhere. Edith
      dressed in tight Halston dress, hair flows huge all round
      her; walks with Richie, who is waiting in a white gray suit
      with a white disco collar outside the lapel, chains around
      his neck.


                Didn't your fiance want to come out
                tonight?


                Yeah, no, I don't know.


                I'm sorry, we don't have to talk
                about it. I was just teasing you.


                Do you ever think, how did I end up
                here? How did my life become this?
                You ever think that? And you
                wonder, am I ever gonna get to a
                better place or is this it? You
                ever feel like that?

      Edith stares, nods yes.


                I do. I definitely know that.

      Edith nods puts a hand on his face.


                I'm sorry we don't have to go
                dancing. We can go have coffee or
                talk or something.


                No, I need this. Please, I need to
                go dancing with you.

      Richie reaches down and squeezes her hand.


                Please.

103   Edith smiles.                                                 103


                OK baby, let's go dancing.





      Richie and Edith DANCE AND DANCE AND SWEAT to Donna Summer's
      "I Feel Love" -- dance -- riding a high.

      Edith EXCUSES HERSELF to go to bathroom -- breaks away
      through crowd -- leaves Richie on dance floor -- then









      SUDDENLY RICHIE STOPS, throws himself back against the other
      stall wall, out of breath. Edith LOOKS OVER HER SHOULDER --


                I really fucking like you.


                I like you too. I want to live,
                alright. For real. No more fake
                shit. Alright?

      She get's real close to his face, almost about to kiss.


                We're going to wait until we decide
                to go for love Richie. For real.
                That's when we fuck. Not till then,
                ok?





                Are you gonna fuck for real or get
                out of the stall for real?


                No more fake shit.


                No more fake shit.


                No more fake shit!


                Fuck me I gotta piss!

      The girl outside the stall bangs on the door.



      She holds his mouth in one hand and leans in and kisses him -
      they get lost --


                Get out!




                    
                I want to be fucking real!














      Irv and Carmine JOYOUSLY SING Tom Jones' "Delilah" WITH a
      RAUNCHOUSLY HAPPY GROUP OF locals.






      Carmine puts down glass of bourbon as he addresses everyone
      emotionally as he looks at Irving.


                    
                This guy right here, Irving
                Rosenfeld? You know what he's gonna
                do? He's gonna bring the Sheik to
                Atlantic City, where we can rebuild
                all those resorts there, put
                everybody back to work.

      Irving stares and is moved by this. Tears come to his eyes,
      he feels bad about it all suddenly.


                He's gonna get this community --
                he's gonna get this state -- back
                on its feet where it belongs. Isn't
                that right?




                He's gonna grow our tax base and
                create thousands and thousands of
                jobs for everyone. You understand
                that? You know what that means?


                To Irving.


                To Irving!

      Carmine sits down on the couch next to Irving.


                This guy right here. He's got a big
                heart.


                     
                I'd just hate it if it didn't work
                out.


                What do you mean? Of course it's
                going to work out. Guys like you
                and me? We dream and we build. We
                never give up. We never quit.









      Irv and Carmine eat breakfast.


                Can I ask you a question.


                Sure.


                Is the sheik black?

      Irving looks flummoxed.


                He's an Arab.

      They look at each other.




                That's black, isn't it?

      Irv isn't sure what to say.


                Why you asking?


                Maybe it's a dumb question, but I
                was just wondering -- I would like
                to arrange for the Sheik to see
                Camden. To see the people of
                Camden. The people I serve. The
                people I love. Who are mostly black
                and Puerto Rican. I really want him
                to see how good this is going to be
                for the community, how ready we are
                for this opportunity, and he can
                see how far his dollar will go.
                You know what I mean? What do you
                think?


                Yeah we can do that. He can see
                Camden.


                    
                Hey, I got something I wanna give
                to you.


                For me?


                I got you a gift. Let's get out of
                here. The girls are going to kill
                us I'm sure.






      They walk in the morning sun to Carmine's Lincoln where he
      opens the trunk and they stare at what is inside.


                What is it?




                It's a microwave. It heats up
                everything. Pasta, lasagna,
                meatballs, whatever.


                Really?


                It's science, yeah. That's how it
                heats up the food. It's scientific.


                And you specifically bought this
                science oven for me.


                    (Carmine stares
                     meaningfully at Irv)
                Yes. A new friend.

      Irv is touched. He sees it is a sincere gift from Carmine,
      because Carmine likes him; not cynical in any way.


                Thank you.


                Don't put metal in it. Come on,
                let's get out of here.







                I need a jet at Teeterboro.







                I need a jet at Teeterboro for the
                sheik.


                You don't need a jet. Let him walk
                to the curb at JFK.




                Stoddard, that's not how it works.
                You got to do it from the feet up.


                That doesn't mean anything. What's
                that mean?


                It means you gotta be committed!
                It means you gotta be committed to
                something in your life, for
                Christ's sake. I want a jet at
                Teterboro for the Sheik. It can be
                a small jet. It doesn't even have
                to take off, cause I know you're so
                worried about how much money the
                Bureau's gonna fucking spend. It
                can take off and land on the
                tarmac, okay?


                Alright, you can have a jet for an
                hour, but it takes off and lands at
                Teterboro.


                I got the jet?


                You got the jet.


110             Thank you.                                            110

      Richie goes to walk out of Stoddard's office but stops at the
      door.


                So tell me the rest of the ice
                fishing story.


                Where was I?


                Your father woke you up, it was a
                blizzard, it was Lake Canoga. Come
                on!




                Okay, well, my brother and I were
                on the ice and my father came out
                of the house and I could see him
                coming. He was holding a lantern,
                and it was in the blizzard and I
                knew he was gonna be angry. So I
                went to intercept my father because
                I knew if he saw what my brother
                was doing he was going to kill him.

      Richie cuts him off.


                So you tried to protect your
                brother, but you couldn't and
                that's why you feel bad, because
                you're trying to protect me and
                you're worried about me. Is that
                what the story's about? About
                protection?


                No, it's not about protection.


                It's not about protection?


                No.


                Alright, fine.

      Richie walks out the door.




      Ros talks to herself carrying tin foil covered tray of
      lasagna.


                    
                "Don't put metal in the science
                oven, don't put metal in the
                science oven, Rosalyn"...always
                treats me like a fucking child.
                I'll do whatever I want.

      She puts the tin foil lasagna into microwave. After a few
      moments it sparks, explodes into flames. DANNY RUNS IN.




                
            Another fire!


                (grabbing a fire
                 extinguisher)
            No, Danny, not that one! That one's
            empty! We gotta use the big one!




            I told you not to put metal in the
            science oven. Why did you do that
            for?


            Don't make such a big deal. Just
            get another one.


            I don't want another one. I want
            the one that Carmine gave me.


            "I want the one Carmine gave me!"
            Carmine, Carmine, why don't you
            just marry Carmine, get a little
            gold microwave and put it on a
            chain around your neck. You want to
            be more like Carmine? Why don't you
            build something like he does,
            instead of all your empty deals
            that are just like your fucking
            science oven. You know I read that
            it takes all of the nutrition out
            of our food. It's empty, just like
            your deals. Empty, empty!



            That's bullshit.


            It's not bullshit. I read it in an
            article. Look, by Paul Brodeur.






                Bring something into this house
                that's gonna take all the nutrition
                out of our food and then light our
                house on fire? Thank God for me.

      Ros stares defiantly, clicks her nails on the counter. PRE-
      LAP JET ROAR, IRVING STARES AT ROS and BURNED OVEN and looks
      at the magazine article.




      JET ROAR LANDING. A small airport. Irv stands alone, staring
      at Edith and Richie kissing. Richie, in long full length
      fleece lined suede coat, walks over towards where Carmine
      stands.







                I don't think you should come to
                Carmine's party tonight. You look
                beautiful by the way.


                Don't look at me. Don't look at my
                legs, don't look at my hair, don't
                smell my hair, don't ask me how I
                am, don't talk to me outside of
                these roles, 'cause we're done.


                What are you doing? Get under the
                umbrella. It's just that Carmine
                wants Rosalyn to come.


                I don't care. You weren't
                listening. I don't care if Rosalyn
                comes. Just do your job, okay?
                You're nothing to me until you're
                everything. I'm not Rosalyn. I'm
                not gonna put up with that shit.

      THEY ARRIVE AT Richie as the JET arrives on the tarmac.


                Now that's a fucking jet right?




          It's good.


          That's the kinda moves you need to
          make.

They walk towards the Jet and walk on leaving Carmine and
Edith waiting outside.




Irv and Richie step aboard to find FBI AGENT PACO HERNANDEZ
putting on a regal looking white Arab keffyeh headdress and
robe -- he looks noble. TWO AGENTS posing as body guards.


          Paco, Richie Dimaso, good to meet
          you in person [shakes Paco's hand] -
          this is Irving Rosenfeld.

Irv nods to Paco and the other agents.


          Paco Hernandez. Nice to meet you.


          Paco? He's--wait, he's not a real
          Arab.


          No. I'm Mexican. From Tuscon.


          Wait, where's my guy? Where's Al
          from Queens?


          Who?


          My friend from Queens. Where is he?
          What are you doing?


          I gotta hire an F.B.I. guy.


          What are you--  You speak
          any Arabic?


          Yeah.   Abdullah Ahmed.




          That's it? That's all you got?


          No, I have a couple phrases.

Irving isn't sure, looks Paco up and down.


           From the feet up, you
          motherfucker. What are you doing?
           Act normal. That's it.
          Like you can barely understand
          English. You can't speak it. You
          say as little as possible. You
          follow my lead. Alright?


           Who's running this?    I
          thought you were running it.


          I am running this but you've gotta
          listen to him. He's the guy with
          the vision.


          I've got the vision? You know what
          vision I had? You just kissing my
          girl outside. That's what vision I
          had.


              
          I thought you guys broke up. I'm
          giving you a compliment.


          What's going on?


          Don't worry about it.

Irving takes a expensive looking ceremonial knife out of his
jacket pocket and holds it out to Paco.


          You got a knife. This is for the
          Mayor. You've got to present it to
          him. Look me in the eye. This means
          a lot to you. Right? That knife.







          Play it. You present it.
          "Friendship for life," alright?
          You gotta feel it. Sacred. Can you
          do it?


          Right. Sacred.


          You gotta sell it.


          Sell it.


          If you believe it's sacred, it's
          sacred.


          Listen to what he's saying.


          Can you do it?


          It's the details. That's what
          makes this guy a genius.


          Again? You compliment me again.
          What is this, rubbing salt in the
          wound?

Irving stares incredulously.


          I'm complimenting you. 
          Any other questions?


          Yeah, I think the name of this
          operation is offensive.


          What?


          Abscam. "Arab Scam?" It's racist.


          Are you fucking kidding? What do
          you care? You're Mexican.





      ELO's "10538 Overture" kicks on. Irv and Richie exit the
      plane walking slightly behind the "sheik" and his
      "bodyguards" - the sheik in the front.

      The Sheik hands the ceremonial knife to Carmine and bows his
      head --


                Hello Sheik, my friend. Welcome.
                On behalf of the great state of New
                Jersey I want to welcome you to New
                Jersey. I know that was redundant.
                I'm sorry. I'm just very nervous.

116   Carmine takes the knife and looks to the others excitedly.       116


                
                We have a great party planned for
                you this evening.





                    
                But what are you talking about, I
                can't go? I just did my hair and
                makeup and everything!


                The Sheik's very particular. It's
                international cultural protocol.


                International protocol? What the
                fuck are you talking about?




                Do not answer that!


                    
                Hello -- Robert Spencer? I don't
                know a Robert Spencer. What do you
                want?


                    
                Give it to me.




          Who is that?


          
          Look, I told you, for God's sake, I
          told you not to call here.


          What is that about?


              
          Two more federal agents tonight,


Ros leaves the room.


          No way.


          Yes. They're bodyguards for the
          Sheik.


          That's too many people for me to
          control, no.


          Look. I'm in charge here, alright?
          Just do it.


          Rosalyn, get off the extension!







              
          I'm not on it!

But she was on it. She heard.


          Look, don't call here again,
          alright? Don't call at home.


          Alright?







          Good night.

He HANGS UP and walks into the kitchen. Rosalyn looks at him.


          Federal agents?


          It's bodyguards for the visiting
          dignitary, that's all.


          What is it, an I.R.S. thing?     Like
          a tax investigation?


          Why you gotta say that? I mean,
          that's why I can't invite you.
          It's too complicated. Listen, come
          on.


          Are you in trouble?


          Look, stop being so nosy.

Irving opens the fridge which is a mess.


          Look at this shit.


          I'm only nosy cause you never tell
          me anything.


          Can we clean up this fridge? I
          mean, what are you causing trouble
          for all the time?







              
          HEL-LO- Oh, hi, Carmine. We were
          just talking about you.




          Irving's being a mean, boring man
          saying that he doesn't want me to
          come tonight.


          Tell him he's crazy!


          Well, I agree. Want to tell him
          yourself?


          Gimme the phone, come on.


          It wouldn't be a party without you!


          Can you imagine? Tell him yourself.

She hands the phone to a very exasperated, anxious, Irv.


           Hey, Carmie.


          Irving, you're crazy! Your wife is
          coming, you kidding me? She's the
          life of the party! Everybody loves
          her.


          I'm the life of the party!


              
          Look, you know what she's like.
          She's unpredictable. She's just
          always --


          Hey, don't talk about me like that!
          What's Carmine saying?


          I can't hear what he's saying.


          Listen, Irving, it's very important
          that she come, you understand?


          Carmine loves me.




              
          This is a really big night for us,
          you understand? Come on, you gotta
          bring your wife. And Dolly's got
          somethin' special for her.

Dolly is getting dressed for the party in the background.


          Tell her I got the nail polish for
          her.


          See? Listen!


           I got
          your nail polish for you, sweetie!


          You see? Somethin' special for
          you. What is it? Tell me. I mean,
          
          What is it, you got a girlfriend
          coming? Come on, I thought we were
          friends. You're not gonna tell me
          you got a girlfriend? This is
          ridiculous.


          No, it's just Rosalyn's
          unpredictable.


          Look, we're gonna handle this like
          men, you understand? You're
          bringing your wife. We're gonna
          have a good time. That's an order
          from the Mayor. Good-bye.


           Alright, you happy?
          Go get ready.

Irv hangs up and exits the kitchen.


          Yes, I am happy.





      Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" plays on the
      soundtrack as Irv drives: tinted glasses, large comb over,
      blue crushed velvet suit, dark tie -- PAN TO:

      VISOR MIRROR -- WHERE Rosalyn APPLIES MASCARA --






      Elton John continues as Carmine LIGHTS A CIGARETTE in a two-
      toned GRAY AND BLACK TUXEDO, at the center of a haphazard red
      carpet situation in front of a has-been beach resort -- large
      old movie premiere spotlights rotate onto the facade in an
      assorted CROWD OF LOCALS some dressed up -

      JULIUS, CARMINE, TITO, MELORA 
      son DOMINIC, daughter LUCILLE, wife Dolly, assorted COPS,
      FIREMEN IN FORMAL UNIFORMS WHITE GLOVES, UNION GUYS in suits,
      fringe the area. Carmine 's family is dressed up.








      Greets everyone.




      THROUGH THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE STEPS: Richie IN A WHITE
      SUIT, Edith stunning SILVER METALLIC Halston dress, WHITE FUR












                      
                  I know who you are.



      Irv tries to turn Rosalyn away, but she keeps turning back
      giving Edith the hairy eyeball, as Edith gives it right back.


                I know who that is Irving.

      Off to the side, Richie steels himself with bump of cocaine
      before walking inside the old resort, his eyes dilate.




      The entourage walks through the ornate lobby as Edith and
      Rosalyn continue to eyeball each other with Irv uncomfortably
      in the middle as Carmine ENTHUSIASTICALLY CONTINUES HIS



                So this is the lobby. Now mind you,
                a week ago this place was a mess,
                but what existed was this
                plasterwork. Look at the detail.
                This is beautiful. My sons are
                craftsmen. 
                Please, tell them what you did.


                Tell them everything you know. The
                trompe l'oeil.


                Birds, sky, clouds, wood. Trompe
                l'oeil -- "Trick of the eye."


                We can restore all of this, you
                see? You save 50 million -- look at
                me -- fifty million right off the
                bat -- I waive the law I helped
                write. It said casino construction
                must be ground up new, we don't do
                new. We renovate.


                We don't do new. We renovate.

      Carmine leads all of them through the very crowded lobby as
      he talks.

      Irving listens intently, moved.





      200 PEOPLE ARE GATHERED around blackjack, roulette, and craps
      tables, playing and having a good time.


                We put in some temporary fun --
                some gaming tables, some play money
                for people to have a good time. For
                charity -- the Boys and Girls Club
                and some arts programs.

      Rosalyn walking with Irving, continues to stare daggers at
      Edith, who stays close to Richie.


      Carmine, Julius, Melora, CONTINUE TO LEAD EVERYONE INTO




      Carmine continues to walk --


                This is the Ocean Room --

      He pushes open double upholstered old doors --




      The bar -- LIKE THE BEMELMANS BAR AT THE CARLYLE HOTEL IN




      Carmine pauses to stare at the MEN AT THE FAR BAR -- FIVE MEN


      AS Irv IS PULLED ASIDE CONFIDENTIALLY BY Carmine -- Richie
      AND Edith WATCH -- Rosalyn STANDS TO THE SIDE -- Carmine
      puts his arm around Irv's shoulders --


                There are some gentlemen over there
                at the bar. That's a hundred and
                thirty years sitting there --
                that's how much time's between
                them. They run the biggest casinos
                in the United States. We have to
                work with them.


                Right.




          The good news is they know how it's
          done. They get it done. You don't
          have to worry. Everyone makes their
          money.


          You mean the Mob?


          Yes, but they're businessmen, okay?
          Now, spend as much or as little
          time with them as you like, but we
          do have to deal with them. All
          we've got to do is go say hello.
          We just gotta say hi, that's all.

Edith looks on, calm, as Richie -- WILD EYED WITH COCAINE AND



          Carmine, maybe -- I'm not sure
          that's such a good idea. We gotta
          confer before we talk to these
          guys.


              
          Confer? What is there to confer
          about? They're casino guys.


          They are businessmen.


          We came all this way, Irving. We
          should be here. What's everybody
          scared of? There's nothing to be
          scared of.

Richie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is
starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks
increasingly uncomfortable.


              
          Those are the guys you're all
          scared of? Those guys over there?
          They don't scare me.

She glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar.


          Rosalyn!



But she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar
who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine
watch.


          I love this!

Rosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits
down in between all the Mafia guys.. THE OTHER THREE SALT AND
PEPPER MAFIA GUYS LAUGH AND TALK WITH Rosalyn - who gulps a
glass of PROSECCO and IS REFILLED BY PETE MUSANE.


          Hi.   Can I sit here?

Carmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the
Mafia guys.


          Irving, this is not a good idea.


          How you guys doing? Everybody over
          there is really scared of you guys,
          you know that?

She knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved.

Dolly ushers her kids to the door.


          Kids, I want you to go up and get
          some pizza and soda, please.

Irving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn.


          It's a disaster.


          I think they have this room all
          wrong.


          Yeah? What would you do?


          I would do it in all black and gold
          and I would do this bar like a big,
          warm golden mirror.


          Sounds beautiful.




          Thank you.

Rosalyn's smitten by the mobsters.


          But you expect that from her
          because she's so beautiful --


          Oh stop.


          Gorgeous.


          I love her hair, so I know I'm
          gonna love how she'd do the room --

He touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs.
Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them.


          How do you do?


              
          I'm sorry is she your wife?


          No, she's my wife. She's my wife.


          Look at these fine gentleman.


          Carmine, there you are.


          How you doing?

Irving takes the glass of prosecco out of Rosalyn's hand and
puts it on table.


          Ohhhh, heyyyyy! Come onnn!


          It's because he's a party pooper.
          He's so boring.

Irving stares fuming at Rosalyn and the guys, he nods and
forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in
his hand. He knows how to fake it.




          You have a very beautiful wife.



          Salud.




THEY ALL LAUGH. RICHIE GUIDES SHEIK with ONE BODY GUARD.


          May I present Sheik Abdullah,
          gentlemen, from Abu Dhabi. Sheik,
          these men are professionals, they
          run the best casinos in the United
          States.

The Sheik acknowledges them with a nod. Irv is extremely
uncomfortable.


          Mr. Sheik, as a sign of our
          seriousness, Mr. Tallegio came from
          Miami to meet you tonight.




          Mr. Tallegio? Why didn't you tell
          me Mr. Tallegio was here?


          He's in the back room.


          It's a sign of disrespect to do
          business on the first meeting.


          That's not true. I don't know what
          your talking about. 
          He's got it all wrong.


          Well, don't leave him back there in
          the back room waiting. Come on,
          let's go.

Rosalyn reaches to have her glass refilled by Dick Helsing
when one of the other guys NUDGES her hip in her tight dress
and she drops into Pete Musane's lap.




                 Hey Irving, I'm going to be having
                 fun. Maybe it will be contagious.


       Irving turns and heads with dread towards the back door with
       Carmine, Richie, and the Sheik. Sydney, worried about Rosalyn
       with Musane, decides to hang back.











                 Carmine!


                 Victor Tellegio was from Miami. He
                 was Meyer Lansky's right-hand man.
                 In his prior reputation as an
                 enforcer from twenty years ago, he
                 was known to never bury a body
                 because he felt it sent a stronger
                 message to leave it in the street.













                 This is the guy we now had to deal
                 with.






       IMPROMPTU TABLE AND CHAIRS. Carmine greets him.




          You sure you don't want to go into
          the Ocean Bar? It's really, it's
          beautiful in there.


          I'm very happy I   don't have to go
          there. I like it   here. There's an
          exit. I'm like a   ghost. Nobody
          knows I'm here.

Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table.

Everyone sits down. Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to
Richie.


          Tell him I speak for our friends in
          Florida. We're very excited. It's
          been our lifelong dream to build
          casino resorts on the East Coast.

Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.


          You told him that? They didn't want
          the Jews to make money, they didn't
          want the Italians to make money,
          definitely don't want the blacks to
          make money. After the oil embargo --
          the gasoline crisis -- the
          hijackings, the Olympics, they
          don't want to see Arabs make money,
          trust me, not on our soil. You can
          tell him this in your own way: I've
          been in the casino business forty
          years. It's scrutinized more
          carefully than any other business.
          Carmine made this legal, but we
          must be careful or they'll take it
          away.


          So, Mister Tellegio, how do you
          think we should approach this? What
          do you want to do?


          If you want to get the gaming
          license and keep it we have to make
          our principal investor here, the
          Sheik, an American citizen.



Irving and Richie both look at Victor intensely not sure
where this is going.


          To expedite citizenship -- well,
          that requires very special
          treatment.


          You would know the right people to
          do that, Carmine.


          Carmine knows everybody.


          What are we talking about?


          U.S. Senators. Congressmen.


          Wow, that's fantastic.


          I say stay away from that. That's
          bad. That's trouble. No, that's not
          good.


          Irving please.


          That's trouble.


          Who is this guy?  What
          are you, a farmer?

Richie and Tellegio both laugh.


          Mr. Tellegio, I'm sorry, this is
          Irving. New York businessman.
          Irving Rosenfeld.


          Irving, Irving. What's the matter,
          Irving? What's the problem?


          Nothing. No problem.




          Don't get your balls in an uproar.
          Everything's fine, everything's
          good. It's all good. It's all good.
          I just hope the other part of this
          is all good. And real. Because
          we're real. You know that. You deal
          with us. We're a real organization.
          We deal with you, we don't know
          what we're dealing with.

Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.
This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to
Richie and points to the Sheik.

Irving watches in horror as --


          Where's he from?


              
          Abu Dhabi.


          Oh, he's from the Emirates.


          Yeah.


              
          (Can I count on you? You gotta be
          honest about this. Do you
          understand me? Good means good. No
          bullshit.)





          
          (Did you hear what I said? Do you
          want me to repeat it?)

Irving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table.


          (What do you think now? Tell me.
          Tell me.)


          Uh, I think, I think what he's --




          No, let him speak for himself.

Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense
moment for everyone at the table.

Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie
share a look -- what is he doing?

A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor
BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys
jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.


          No, I know him.


          You guys are way too serious for a
          party! Hey, what are
          you drinking? You got a drink?





              
          We're in a very serious meeting.
           I apologize.




          I understand, you're in conference.
          You gotta come with me now. You got
          a speech to give. Everyone's
          waiting for you.


          Al, I'll be right behind you, okay?
          Trust me.

Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio
to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS



              
          It is great doing business with
          you. The investment is real. It was
          a pleasure to meet you.

Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything
passable in Arabic.




          What are the odds of an Italian guy
          from Miami knowing Arabic? But it
          turns out he's got casino
          investments in the Mideast and he
          spent two years learning it to keep
          the upper hand.

Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.


          Listen to me carefully. If you're
          real, you put ten million in the
          bank of our choice in the next two
          weeks.

Carmine nods.


          Carmine, listen to me carefully, if
          you're real, you put ten million in
          the bank of our choice in the next
          two weeks or not only will the
          Sheik feel insulted, but our
          friends in Florida will feel deeply
          disrespected and so will I.

Irving looks at Victor, who stares back at him. This is bad.










          Rosalyn, you need to come with me
          alright?


          I don't need to come with you.


          You need to come with me. This
          needs to stop. Come on.


          Oh, you think I should come with
          you?




          Yeah, you need to come with me
          right now.

Rosalyn takes her wrist out of Sydney's grasp.


          Why don't you get your fucking
          hands off me, you fucking whore!


          Hey!


          You're a whore.  This
          is my husband's whore!


          That's real nice.


          We're not going to do this in the
          Ocean Room tonight. Not tonight.
          Please.


          This is my husbands whore!

Dolly escorts Edith over to one side of the room away from
Rosalyn.


          You stay over here with me.
          Everybody just calm down. I don't
          know what's going on.

Pete looks over to Rosalyn.


          You alright? Take it easy. These
          things happen. Whatever's meant to
          be will be.

Rosalyn smiles at Pete.


          That's what I always say.


          You say that?


          Yeah.




                See? Kindred spirits.


                Whatever's meant to be will be.


                Whatever's meant to be will be.












      Rosalyn looks in mirror: sadness, anger, fear. Edith rushes
      in.


                What the hell do you think you're
                doing?


                What the hell do I think I'm
                doing?! What the fuck do you think
                you're doing? You really gonna come
                in here and judge me for flirting
                with somebody after you've been
                fucking my husband for how many
                years?!


                You don't have any fucking clue
                what's going on!

      Rosalyn holds her hand, with wedding ring to Sydney's face.


                I got a ring on my finger. We have
                a child together.


                He doesn't love you Rosalyn he
                loves me. And you know it and I
                know it and he knows it. And it
                might be done now, but it was
                beautiful and it was real.




          Stop.


          And we loved each other.


          Shut up.

Rosalyn starts to tear up.


          You scare him, and you manipulate
          him, and you use your son!


          Well, he must like it on some
          level. He must want it because he
          keeps coming back for it. It's like
          that perfume that you love that you
          can't stop smelling, even when
          there's something sour in it. You
          can't get enough of it. But guess
          what, he's never gonna leave me.
          He's always going to want me, and I
          will make you so sorry, Edith. I
          will make you so sorry for what
          you've done to my family, mark my
          words.


          That is fucked up! I would never
          say anything that fucked up to
          anybody, but you do because you're
          gross inside, you're so fucked up
          and gross.


          Oh, I'm gross inside?


          Yeah.


          Maybe you're gross inside, with
          robbing people and all that shit
          that you do? Maybe we're both gross
          inside, that's what Irving loves
          about us. At least he's consistent
          with his women. You know, sometimes
          in life all you have are fucked up,
          poisonous choices.

Rosalyn reaches over, grabs Sydney's face and kisses her.



      Rosalyn laughs a toxic, tough front dark laugh and walks out.


      Sydney looks into the mirror and wipes the lipstick off her
      lips as Rosalyn storms out of the powder room.























                We need to talk! This is serious.










                Ladies and gentlemen, your friend,
                the working man's friend, my
                friend, Mayor Carmine Polito!


      ON STAGE: Carmine TAKES MIC

      Irving stands off to the side of the stage as his world
      closes in around him. Pulls his heart pills out of his pocket
      and takes one. Sydney sees this as she stands nearby with
      Richie.

      Irv, Edith, Richie watch near stage, jostled. Rosalyn enters
      the ball room looking disheveled as she is guided by Pete
      Musane looks to stage.




                    
                Hello, Camden! Hello, New Jersey!
                Hello, Atlantic City! [CROWD ROARS]

                There's no money nowhere. You gotta
                be kidding me! -- don't they

                Jersey is that we never, ever give

      Carmine dominates the crowd and you can see the emotion in
      his face as he says this. He raises his glass to the crowd.


                Please, raise a glass with me to a
                new era that begins tonight. From
                me and my family, we thank you. For
                all the hard work that you've given
                us in the community. Look what
                you've done. This is beautiful!
                Thank you!

      Crowd ROARS WILDLY. Irv watches, MOVED AND DESTROYED.









      Irving walks in with his keys, same clothes from night
      before, as ocean sounds continue, TAKES A GUN FROM THE SAFE,
      and he stands looking lost and lonely, he turns on the
      electric dry cleaning rack, where he and SYDNEY STOOD
      TOGETHER, IN LOVE. He looks heartsick. HE STEPS INSIDE THE

                Last night was insane. I got it all
                figured out.


                    
                Stoddard Thorsen.


                    
                Listen, I need the Sherman Suite at
                the Plaza Hotel, okay?


                    
                That's a whole floor of the hotel.


                I need a whole floor. I need it for
                my operation





                
                Stop calling it your operation,
                Richard. It's not your operation.
                And I'm not giving you a whole
                floor of the Plaza Hotel.





                I have members of Congress that are
                gonna come in right now to try to
                give the Sheik citizenship. They're
                taking bribes. This is happening
                right now. That's what's happening
                right now.






          
          Bribing members of Congress are you
          out of your fucking mind?





          Stoddard. Stoddard! Shut up!
          Listen! Do you know who Victor
          Tellegio is? Victor. Tellegio.
          Works for Meyer Lansky. You know
          who that is?


          I know who Victor Tellegio is.


          Resorts International! He wants ten
          million dollars. I have two weeks!


          You're not getting ten million
          dollars.


              
          Just listen to me! You're not
          listening to me! I have two weeks!
          I have two weeks to put this thing
          together and I need you to get me
          the Sherman Suite at the Plaza
          Hotel. And your going to fucking do
          it!


          Lower your voice. You don't get to
          yell at me.

Richie SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE. Edith  STARES



          Calm me down baby. You gotta calm
          me down.

He handles her hips and neck and waist and ass.


          Baby let's do this. Let's do this
          right now. --




          No, no.


          I want to do this. You're fucking
          skin is glowing baby. Your skin is
          glowing.


          I'm not doing this with you. We're
          not going to do this unless we do
          it for real, alright?


          I want to do this now!


          That's what we agreed on so we're
          not going to do that alright?
          Alright? Where are you? You're
          acting all scary.

She grabs him by the head to calm him down.


          Are you here with me?




              
          I love you. I love you. Look at me.
              
          I'm in love with you. It is real
          now. I just said it so now's the
          time.

He handles her, nuzzles her neck, starts to turn her on.


              
          You want the truth? You want real?


          I'm ready for real.





          OK, this is real. Do you hear my
          voice? This is real. This is real.
          What you hear is real.



Richie steps back quickly and grabs Sydney.


          What?


          This is me.


          What do you mean? What are you
          doing an accent? An American
          accent?


          No. There is no English. There's
          only American. There is no English.

Richie looks at her and continues to hold her looking very
confused and flustered.


          What are you talking about? Stop
          it. You're Edith. You're Edith
          Greensly. I checked your records.


          I falsified my records back to
          birth. I falsified them.


          My name is Sydney Prosser, and I'm
          from Albuquerque, New Mexico. I'm
          not Edith Greensly. There is no
          Edith Greensly.

Richie steps back. He stares at her darkly.


          You're -- freaking -- me -- out.
          No, you said in the stall that we
          were going to be real and that we
          weren't going to fake it.


          I'm being real now. This is who I
          am. I'm Sydney Prosser. Ok?


          So -- why -- did you do an English
          accent after that?


          I'm sorry I didn't tell you in the
          stall.




          I created Edith because I needed
          her to survive, okay? But I'm done
          with that now. I'm so fucking done
          with that. Like you do what you
          need to survive, right? You do it.
          You know, you live with your mom --
          you have a fiance you don't even
          acknowledge, right? That's what
          you do. And you curl your hair in
          little fucking curlers, which is --
          No, it's okay, you look good with
          it, but you know -- you have
          straight hair, so that's what you
          do to survive. You do all sorts of
          things, you know. We all do.


              
          Please don't talk about that. I'm
          confused. I'm confused and --


          I'm fucking confused too, alright?


          -- I think we should fuck, and then
          we'll feel it and we won't be
          confused anymore.




          No -- I want to talk. I don't want
          to fuck.


              
          Yes! Come on.


          NO! I'm not fucking you. I'm not
          fucking fucking you!

RED FACED LIKE HE MAY HIT HER, a vein stands out in his neck.
SHE FLINCHES. HE SCREAMS like an animal in confusion and
frustration.










Richie in pain holds his cut forehead and eyebrow.


              


They hear a door open off screen, someone approaches. Irving
appears from around the corner of the wall pointing his
handgun at Richie.


          Will you please step away from
          Edith. I'm asking you nicely please
          step away from Edith right now.


          What the fuck --


          Step away from her. Please.


          You mean Sydney?

Irving looks over to Sydney very confused.


          I told him. I'm sorry. I just don't
          give a fuck anymore, I don't give a
          fuck. I don't fucking care.


          Irving has a gun.


          What Richie's gotten us into is
          worse then jail. I told you last
          night, don't sit down with those
          goons. And what? Now what? No one's
          getting ten million for Tellegio.
          It's over.


          I don't think so.

Irving and Sydney stare.



              
          Because when Tellegio finds out
          what happened, do you think he's
          gonna go after me? I don't think
          so. Someone from the Bureau?




          Think he's gonna go after a
          politician? He's gonna kill you.
          Then he's going to go after your
          son. And Sydney.

Richie PICKS UP PHONE AS THEY WATCH -- HE DIALS. INTERCUT:


              
          Stoddard Thorsen.


              
          You're going to give me the Sherman
          Suite. The whole floor.




          That's a NO. I said no wacko.


          And you're going to tell me the
          point of that FUCKING fishing
          story.


          Not the way you're behaving.



          What's the matter with you? Where
          are you right now?


          What does that make a difference?


          Just tell me where the fuck you
          are.


          The field office on 61st street.


          I'm coming to 61st Street. Right
          now.


          You're going to do what?


          To beat -- your ass.




                You're going to what?

      Richie SLAMS the phone down, storms out the apartment.





                You were right. We should have gone
                away.

      Irving sits in the corner of the room a disheveled mess.
      Sydney sits on the bed drinking a Fresca.


                I should have gone away with you.


                We were supposed to do it from the
                feet up like you always said.
                That's how we were meant to do it
                but you didn't do it like that. You
                didn't do it like that. You played
                it safe so there was always a
                danger you were going to end up
                with Rosalyn in the dead space,
                floating on some dead spaceship
                with the furniture and the
                curtains. And I was your life line
                out and you were mine and that was
                ok.


                    (Irving stares at her,
                     emotional)
                I wish I could get you back.

      He walks across the room and sits down on the bed next to
      Sydney.


                You know I can't do it without you.
                You know that. Come on. Me, you
                and Danny. Like we said.


                Like I said. You never said that. I
                said that. We gotta get over on all
                these guys. That's what we need to
                be thinking about right now.

      Irving takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes.




                That's big. That's crazy. Whatever
                it is, it's got to be the best
                we've ever done.

      Sydney nods her head yes, stares intensely at Irving as the
      camera tilts down to reveal: their hands clasped together.




      High ceiling, old office. Close on a tape recorder.



      OPPOSITE PROSECUTOR, AMADO   - - the tape recorder and
      microphone sit on the desk   in front of Stoddard as he records
      a statement for a report.



                Agent Dimaso called me late at
                night on the 21st. I believe that
                he was intoxicated. He threatened
                me and I told him this was
                inappropriate. I told him
                procedures exist for reasons we
                must respect. This is the third
                such call I received from Agent
                Dimaso. He called me again the
                night of the 5th and he threatened
                to kill me. Subsequently he
                demanded that I allow him to use
                the Sherman Suite at the Plaza
                hotel for purposes of bribing
                members of congress.

      Camera pull-back reveals: THE CHASTENED Richie SITS
      LISTENING, IN A SUIT AND TIE. He's in trouble with their
      boss, the prosecutor.


                I am so sorry.


                I'm not finished. There's a lot
                more.

      Richie gets up and pulls up a chair next to Stoddard.
      Stoddard flinches and moves away like he's going to get hit
      again.




                I have nothing but the utmost
                respect for you as my mentor. (he
                reaches down and turns the tape
                recorder off) and as my --


                    
                What are you doing?


                I just want to talk from my heart.
                I don't want it on record. I want
                to get vulnerable.


                Can I finish? Can I finish my
                statement?


                Of course. I respect you.


                I think you do other things besides
                respect me.






      Stoddard paces while on the phone, holds up a finger to
      Richie to wait, Richie picks up Stoddard's phone -- rips the
      cord out and smashes Stoddard across the face with the base.
      Doesn't stop til Stoddard falls to the ground, knocks over
      desk chair and bookcase behind.






      They stare at each other.


                It's just hard for me to control my
                passion. I'm a very passionate
                person.  You're
                from New York. You understand this.
                He goes ice fishing in the midwest.


                That was told to you in confidence.




          He's an ice fishing guy. Look at
          him.






Where we left off. Stoddard reaches with bloodied hands
across -- what is he reaching for? Oh, on a small table, a
gun and a clip.


          What are you doing pulling out your
          gun? Stop it. That's not you.


          No, it's me. This is me. It's me.


          Don't do something that you don't
          know anything about. Alright?

Richie grabs his gun and starts to load it.






          I'll show you how it's done. I'm
          not even going to hit you.

He points the gun at Stoddard.


          Watch this fucko.






Richie and Stoddard stare at each other in silence.


          So, you want to use the Sherman
          Suite? The entire floor?

Stoddard throws his head back, looks at ceiling in
exasperation.







Yes! At the Plaza Hotel.


What happened to the Mafia? I
thought you were --


This is where they intersect! This
is where the two things intersect.
The Politicians and the Mafia.
Victor Tellegio's people who run
resorts international --


Victor Tellegio showed his face?


Yes. I sat with him. I sat with
Victor Tellegio. I hung out with
him. We can get him. We can get his
whole organization as well as
getting any number of congressmen.
I mean, that's just peeling the
first layer of the onion.


Wow. How you going to do that?


We would get ten million dollars
and put it into an account --


TEN MILLION DOLLARS?! Ten Million
dollars?


And that's how we just let them
know we're for real.


What does he say he's gonna do for
the ten million dollars? How are we
trapping him?


He promises to build casinos,
handle the skims, do the licencing -





                And you have him on tape saying
                this. You have that right? No.


                    
                I want you to find a safer way to
                get Victor Tellegio on a wire. No
                ten million dollars -- that's
                crazy.


                Thank you.

      Richie looks down, defeated.


                Even to entrap Tellegio it's crazy.
                But you can have the Sherman Suite -






                --Stoddard, please -- To go and get
                me some congressmen. Go get some
                congressmen taking bribes. I want
                to pinch us some congressmen, ok?
                You come back to me. I'm proud of
                you.


                Thank you.
                
                And Stoddard.




      Richie and Stoddard walk down large, echoey Federal building
      corridor. Stoddard walking ten feet ahead turns and points at
      Richie.


                    
                Good luck keeping your job, by the
                way, and staying out of jail -- and
                not being killed by the Mob. But
                other than that you're doing a
                great job.

      Stoddard turns and storms off.




                    
                What's the end of the ice fishing
                story?


                I'm not telling you the end of the
                ice fishing story.


                I'm going to call your fucking
                brother and find out from him.


                My brother's dead.


                That's how it ends. He fell through
                the fucking ice.


                    
                No it's not. He died a different
                way, many years later.

      He storms off and leaves Richie staring in the hallway.




      Establishing.




      Richie walks out of a surveillance room and down the hallway
      to where Irv and Sydney wait.


                Listen I know it's awkward and I
                just want to say I'm sorry,
                alright? I think we can stick
                together and still fulfill our
                goal. I mean, we got the Sherman
                Suite.


                You got the whole floor?


                We got the whole floor, yeah.


                That's good.




          Yeah, you ok?


          Yeah. You?

Richie gestures to his eye that Sydney smashed with the
picture frame. He's got a few little scabs.


          It's alright. I got hit a little
          bit. My eye. It's a little blurry
          but I got drops at the pharmacy.

Richie looks over to Irving.


          Hey, you OK?


          Yeah, I'm good --

Richie looks back over to Sydney


          Listen, I'm sorry.


          I'm sorry.


              
          I'm sorry Irving.

Irving doesn't know what to say, starts to say something
twice, stops, can't think of what to say. Leaves Richie
hanging.




Richie directs where cameras should be concealed. AGENTS



          You can put a camera here. And we
          get it all on film. You like it?


          I do.


              
          Give me those flowers.




                   If we put the flower base here and
                   put a camera in there we can get a
                   clear shot of the couch there where
                   we can put the congressmen.

      Irving, sitting on the couch, looks kind of disturbed by
      this.


                   That's right. That's the idea.





                   And Carmine will go to jail after
                   he delivers us the congressmen soon
                   to be felons.

      Carmine's aid MELORA answers a ringing phone as Carmine sits
      at his desk.


                   Congressman O'Connell is on the
                   phone --




                   I got to take this you guys
                   everyone out please.

      Dolly Polito, checking the unwatered plants in her husbands
      office with her coat on, she has just stopped by. Turns and
      holds up a parched and dying houseplant.


                   This is sad. It's just sad.


                   Dolly please, I gotta take this.


                   Ok, sorry. Everyone out. Go out.


                   
                   Congressman, how you doing? It's
                   Carmine. Tell me you're gonna be in
                   Trenton this week. We have an
                   amazing investment opportunity I'd
                   like to discuss with you.







      Richie on a black and white surveillance camera as he shows
      the briefcase full of money.


                I'm federal agent Richard Dimaso.
                I've placed seventy-five thousand
                dollars into this briefcase for
                Representative John O'Connell of
                the Ninth District.






      Carmine shakes hands with REP. JOHN O'CONNELL --


                Congressman, thank you for coming
                by, John --


                Representative O'Connell was
                contacted by Carmine Polito to ask
                if he could obtain rapid
                citizenship through an act of
                Congress for one Sheik Abdullah,
                investor.

      They walk up the capitol steps.


                You wanna talk jobs, investment,
                construction, if we can expedite a
                very wealthy man's citizenship --




150   CAMERA PANS TO HOLE IN CORNER and CAMERA LENS --                150




                How you doing congressmen?


                I'm excited to be here.


                This brings the state back. I mean,
                how long we known each other?




          You know what this is gonna do for
          us? This is huge for the state of
          New Jersey. It stabilizes our
          economy.


          Hotels. Restaurants. It's waiting
          to happen. Carmine sees it, this
          fucking thing is waiting to happen.


          The goddamn bankers. Keeping their
          money on the sidelines. How we
          supposed to get anything done?


          Bankers only put money in the game
          when they can reap insane profit.

Richie staring, mesmerized by this trap.


          The only problem is this
          citizenship situation. I mean, we
          got to expedite it as soon as
          possible.


          Yeah, well I'll tell you, you came
          to the right place.

Everyone looks tense and on edge before.


          I'll make it happen.


          Hey, this is going to happen.

Richie slides the briefcase in John's direction.


          This is real. You understand? This
          is real. On my family. On my kids.
          On my life. On my work.


          I know that, Carmine. You're a
          good man

This hurts Irving to see his friends sincerity.






                
                I'm federal agent Richard Dimaso. I
                am placing 75 thousand dollars in
                this brief case for one
                Representative Gerald Sanders of
                the 3rd district.







                I don't want to do anything illegal-


                Please Gerry. Use it as a campaign
                donation. Whatever you want to do.

      Richie slides the briefcase to him.





                    
                I'm placing g $60,000 into an this
                brief case for one Congressman Eric
                Keshoygan of the 4th district --


                I'm going to do what I can to help
                Carmine.

      Irv watches in pain as he sits with them.







                A $100,000 into this briefcase for
                two term United States Senator
                Horton Mitchell of New Jersey.

      A distinguished silver haired Senator, older.


                Atlantic City. All the way down the
                shore. A mecca by the sea.



      Richie slides over the briefcase.


                Carmine you're beloved by your
                people. Your constituency is not
                even your constituency it's your
                family. That's what you represent,
                family.


                One small thing we do for this man
                is a huge thing we do for the
                people of New Jersey. This is what
                we can leave behind.

      Irving can't stand how hopeful his friend Carmine is being
      because Irving knows Carmine is being set up. He gets up --


                Irving what are you doing?


                Where you going?


                     (excusing himself
                      uncomfortably)
                I just gotta go see a man about a
                dog.







                    
                I appreciate this. On my family. On
                my kids. This needs to happen. It's
                gotta happen. You've got my word

      Irving walks out of the room --




      --into another room where Sydney on elegant gold couch, sits
      alone. Surveillance equipment and room service trays are on
      the coffee table.




      She watches Irving who is pacing anxiously and very wound up.




                    
                I want to save us. I want to save
                Carmine. It's fucking killing me.


                You know the only way to help
                Carmine is through the Tellegio
                thing.


                It's dangerous. We gotta get a wire
                in there. We gotta make him feel
                safe.


                There's only one thing that can
                really fuck this up and that's your
                wife.


                       
                Yep.




      Rosalyn fixes Danny's coat, hands him his lunch and sends him
      off towards the school's front door --

      CLOSE UP: ROSALYN STARES INTO LENS. Emotional, a mixture of
      sadness and hope. She holds a closed bottle of her favorite
      nail finish and smells it nostalgically.








      He gently puts a hand on her knee. She leaves it there for a
      moment before pushing it away. They stare at each other.












          I don't like your husband. You're
          no good together. He doesn't
          appreciate you. Hey, it happens.
          It happened in my marriage. That's
          why I went to Miami. Sometimes you
          just gotta be tough. You gotta
          stand up and you gotta leave, you
          know?

Rosalyn looks at Pete smitten.


          Sometimes you gotta let something
          die to let something live. You're
          too beautiful to be unhappy.


          I know. I mean, I don't want to
          badmouth my husband, but let me
          badmouth my husband for a second.
          He just thinks that he knows
          everything and he's so full of
          shit. He's such a liar. He thinks
          that I'm stupid, but I'm not
          stupid. I hear him on the phone
          arguing. He loves Carmine, but he
          hates that other guy, that curly-
          headed I.R.S. guy, or whatever
          who's carting around my husband's
          ex-lover, that redheaded whore.





          Anyway. You can see that it drives
          him crazy.


          You said IRS. What IRS guy? What
          are you talking bout?


          I hear them on the phone. I think
          that he's got Irv in some sort of
          bind or something and he's making
          him do all of this stuff and so Irv
          and Carmine right now are at the
          Plaza Hotel throwing away all this
          money at like Congress or whatever.
          They're giving money to congress or
          something. I don't really know but
          I overheard it on the phone.



      Pete's brow furrows - this is serious.


                You know I hate to do this to you
                but I have to go talk to your
                husband. My boss is already angry.
                You stay here I'm going to give you
                some money for a taxi home.

      He puts cash in her hands.


                You stay here. Get yourself some
                dessert. Finish the bottle of
                prosecco. I'm sorry.

      Rosalyn and Pete hold hands as Rosalyn stares into his eyes.
      Very emotional.


                You alright?


                    
                I don't like change. It's really
                hard for me. Sometimes I think that
                I'll die before I change.

      He kisses her.


                It's gonna be okay. You're gonna
                come live with me in Miami.

      Pete gets up and walks. As he does:


164             Don't hurt him too bad. He's still                    164
                Danny's father.










      Irv and Carmine down sidewalk leaving from The Plaza Hotel --

      Pete Musane stands next to an open passenger side door, --
      Irv and Carmine do not move, they stare at the open door.








170   Rosalyn in full muumuu, wearing cleaning gloves and holding a 170
      vacuum sings to LIVE AND LET DIE while Danny sits on the
      couch watching her. Very intense.




      Irving and Carmine sit up front with Pete driving and Dick
      Helsing sits in the back seat looking angry.





      Rosalyn continues to sing and gets more intense as the music
      picks up.




      Irving looks over to Pete nervously. Unsure of what's going
      to happen.





      Rosalyn whips her head up and down, dancing manically through
      the house.




      Rosalyn sits on the bed with Danny with clothes all over the
      place while smoking a cigarette.


                Life is ridiculous and I would
                never say anything bad about your
                father in front of you but your
                father is a sick son of a bitch.


                Daddy's a sick son of a bitch?


                Don't repeat that. But yes.





Irving's Caddy comes screeching up to the house and parks in
the driveway. Irv get's out and races inside.




Rosalyn is still sitting on the bed with Danny.


              


Rosalyn looks scared.


          This is a real low in our
          relationship! You know where I was
          recently? I was in your boyfriend's
          fucking car! I saw your nail
          polish.








WINDSHIELD SMELLS IT, WORRIED. Carmine glances over his
shoulder anxiously at Dick Helsing in the back seat.


          What's this I hear about your curly
          haired friend working for the
          Government?


          What?! Who said that?


          That's bullshit!


          Your wife.

Irving is surprised to hear this.


          That's bullshit.


          Rosalyn?






              











          Hey, what the fuck?! --


          Shut up. Shut the fuck up.











          What are you talking about?!






          Get out of here! I'm not doing
          anything!





Irving looks down to see Danny sitting there on the bed.


          Danny. Come here buddy alright? Go
          draw a picture or something.

Irving ushers Danny out of the room.




          You're a real sick son of a bitch
          for screaming at me like that in
          front of Danny.














          He's a mobster alright? That's who
          you're dealing with.


          Alright fine! Yes, I wanted to hurt
          you but how do you think that I
          feel all day when you leave me
          alone all day? And all I've ever
          wanted is for you to love me.
          That's all I ever wanted. And stay
          married and for you to love me. And
          that's why I'm going to Miami!


          You're NOT going to Miami.


          That's why I'm going to Miami with
          Pete!

Irving picks up Rosalyn's clothes from the bed where there is
an open suitcase, throws them back in the closet.


          You are NOT going to Miami.


          I finally found somebody who loves
          me just like YOU always wanted.


          Too dangerous. Miami? Not now. Too
          dangerous.

Irv continue to throw clothes back into the closet.




          He likes me just the way I am.


          Not now. Everything has to stay
          normal right now. And you're going
          to shut your mouth!


          You told me that you wanted me to
          find a nice quiet man!


          Oh and what a DOOZY you picked!


          He's the one.


          He's the most dangerous guy ever.






Irving reaches for his heart pills but they fall out of his
hands and scatter on the floor. He bends down to grab them
and almost falls. Rosalyn helps him up.


          Why aren't you taking your heart
          pills? Irving, what's going on?
          What kind of trouble are you in?!
          What's happening?


          
          I've got a plan.


          What's happening?

Irving coughs and steps back. Out of breath and very winded.


          I've got a plan.


          You've got a plan? When did you get
          it?




                It really fucking came to me when I
                was inside of that canvas bag with
                your boyfriend's hands around my
                throat. That's when it really came
                to me.





                Take it off! Take the bag off his
                head!

      Dick pulls the bag off Irving's head, his comb over is all
      messed up. IRVING GASPS. Pete and Dick LAUGH --


                We've got two million coming this
                week!


                What do you think this is? You
                think this is a fucking down
                payment plan? Like were Sears of
                Chevrolet?


                You ask Victor if he wants two
                million this week. That's real
                money. Two million.


                Two million? How?


                Wired in.




      They LAUGH, Irving's hair is all messed up.

      Pete patches out. Irving and Carmine are a mess, shirts
      ripped open, no buttons, they look at each other VERY SHAKEN.


                Is it true? Is it true what he
                said about your wife?


                It's not fucking true. That's not
                true.






          I can save all of us, and we can
          save money. I can take care of you
          and Danny. OK? But you gotta close
          your mouth.

Rosalyn looks satisfied and points her finger at Irving.


          I knew it. I have always said,
          Irving, that you are very, very
          hard to motivate properly. And I
          knew that Pete was gonna go over
          there and knock some sense into
          you. I've been reading this book,
          Irving. It's by Wayne Dyer, about
          the power of intention.

Irving can't believe what he's hearing right now.

Rosalyn, very satisfied, reaches over the bed and grabs a
book.


          And my intention in sending Pete
          over to you was so that you could
          come up with this plan. So, you're
          welcome.

Irving incredulous, thinks to himself how to respond. Forces
himself to say gently --


          OK. Thank you, Rosalyn. Thank you
          for the plan.


          You're welcome.


          I appreciate that. So, I think that
          we should be partners on this.


          I'm a good partner. Almost better
          than Edith. You ever think about
          that? You ever think about how you
          might have underestimated me?


          So what is our plan? Tell me the
          plan. What are you gonna do?




          I'm going to keep my mouth shut and
          I'm not going to say anything but
          what do I do if Pete calls me? What
          am I supposed to say?


          You gotta stop talking about your
          government agencies and your I.R.S.
          and your tax and your conspiracies
          and all of that. You're gonna say
          how you were wrong, you were wrong
          about that.


          I'll tell Pete that I was wrong but
          you know that in real life, I was
          right for saying all that stuff
          because then that spurred on the
          actions that made you come up with
          this plan. So I will tell Pete.


                



              (pointing with cigarette
               between fingers)
          The power of intention Irving. The
          power of intention.

Irv is doing everything he can to hold it together.


          OK. You were right.

Rosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to Irving.


          You're so smart. Good job, peaches.


          Irving, I've been doing a lot of
          thinking and -- you need to grow
          up. And you need to face the
          facts. And I think that both of us
          will be a lot happier if we get a
          divorce.

As he listens to words he has been saying himself for months,
now spoken as Rosalyn's idea.







                 Just think about it. 
                 These things are never easy.

       Irving starts walking away towards the door.


                 Alright.


                 Irving. Good luck with your plan.




       The spare rhythmic intro of Jeff Lynne's "Long Black Road"
       plays as Richie looks back over his shoulder and walks
       towards the building with intensity.


                 Necessity truly is the mother of
                 invention. The F.B.I. was willing
                 to wire the two million dollars if
                 it meant taking down Tellegio and
                 his entire organization.




       Brenda in her office.

       Amado looking very pleased on the telephone.




       Irving walks with Richie and Sydney up to an office building.


                 A mobster like Tellegio would never
                 meet at the Plaza Hotel, but only
                 at the office of his attorney,
                 Alfonse Simone.

       They walk into mob lawyer Simone's building.




       On an old faded directory: 7TH FLOOR: ALFONSE SIMONE #701










       They open door to large, spare reception area of Alfonse
       Simone's law office. MIDDLE AGED SECRETARY looks up and picks
       up the phone.




















       Alfonse Simone rises from behind his desk. A silent secretary
       sitting at his side in a white dress stares at our heros as
       Simone steps forward to introduce himself.


                 Alfonse Simone.

       Edith walks up to him to shake hands. He shakes hands with
       Irving and Richie as well. Man in the suit closes the door
       behind them.


                 Edith Greensly.


                 Irving Rosenfeld.


                 Good afternoon.


                 Please, be seated.



They sit in three chairs facing Simone's desk: Sydney/Edith,
Richie, Irving.

Simone sits behind his desk, the silent secretary sits just
behind him slightly to the side, stares at Edith, Richie,
Irving.


          I appreciate the fact that you all
          came in person, but the trip was
          really unnecessary because this
          whole thing could have been done
          with a simple wire transfer. As a
          matter of fact this is the number
          of our wire right here.

Simone slides a small pink piece of paper across the desk to
them. Richie stares at the paper, but doesn't touch it.


          Where is Mr. Tellegio?


          Mr. Tellegio unfortunately was
          called out of town on business.


          That's not good. We were willing to
          come here today, in person, to see
          Mr. Tellegio, as a sign of respect
          to give two million dollars --


          I can assure you that I have the
          power of attorney --


          Excuse me. If you'll let me finish,
          we are willing to give two million
          dollars today of the ten. But
          without Mr. Tellegio here --


              
          We can't, we can't make that
          decision. It's not the right thing.
          It's not the right time. It's just
          not good.


              
          You don't have the authorization to
          make this kind of choice so don't
          be hasty, alright?




          I'm not being hasty. It's just,
          let's be smart about it. This is
          not how we do business. 
          I'm sorry. I apologize.

Richie motions with his hand to Edith that he agrees with
Irving.


          He's right, we can't.


          I think you should hang in there.


          For what? The guy's not here.


          He isn't.


          That's it.

He stands, goes to the door.


          This is a surprise. The Sheik
          doesn't like surprises.

Edith turns in her chair to face them in the doorway.


          Don't leave.


              
          Edith, this is not your decision to
          make.


          I understand but maybe we can call
          the Sheik. Let's call the Sheik.


          That's not the plan. That's not
          the --

Edith locks eyes with Richie. Richie stares at Edith, waves
Irving off with his hand.


          No, let's -- I'll call the Sheik.
           Can I use your phone?




          Please do.


              
          I don't know if he's in, I'll call
          the Sheik. But before I do, I'd
          like to go over specifically what
          this money will be used for.


          What we will do is we guarantee all
          proper licenses and construction
          permits for any hotel casino that
          plans to open before the end of the
          year.

Richie glances down at Edith and her handbag. PUSH IN ON A




          And we'll throw in the customary
          privileges and protection.


          What if there are obstacles, what
          will you do?


          Obstacles? We are prepared to
          overcome any obstacles.


          This is a big enterprise.


          If we have to pay somebody off,
          we'll pay somebody off. If we have
          to lean on somebody, intimidate
          somebody, we'll intimidate
          somebody. We're experienced. This
          is our business.




          That's powerful stuff. Thank you.






          And I'll tell you something else.
          At the end of this we'll teach you
          how to skim and how to cut it up
          and make some money on the side.
          Because we invented skimming. We've
          been doing it for thirty years.

A smile creeps across Richie's face.


          Thank you. Thank you for clarifying
          that.

Richie picks up the phone to dial.


          I think that will be OK for the
          Sheik.







          This is the Sheik.


              
          Mr. Tellegio is not here. It's
          just Mr. Alfonse Simone, his
          lawyer. Are we still ok to wire the
          money?


          Simone can take the money. What's
          the number?




Amado writes it down and hands it to Brenda to call in.


          The funds have been transferred.


          
          The funds have been transferred.

Amado nods: victory. BACK TO:





       Richie hangs up.


                 The money's been wired.


                 I think we have a deal.


                 Yes we do sir.


                 Pleasure doing business with you.


                 Okay, well, thank you very much,
                 Mr. Simone.





                 The Sheik's very excited.


                 I'm sure that we'll be seeing each
                 other.

       Richie and team start to walk out.


                     
                 Oh I'm sure we'll be seeing each
                 other very soon. You may even get
                 sick of me, like these two.


                 I don't think I'll get sick of you.
                 Nice meeting you.

       Richie, Edith, and Irving walk down the hall after leaving
       his office. Richie smiles as the opening of Bowie's "The Jean
       Genie" momentously starts. Edith smiles as she walks down the
       hall followed by Irving. Richie puts his hand on the door
       knob to exit the hallway.





















                    
                We're ambitious, that's why!

      Richie suddenly moves to the reel to reel surveillance tape
      and quiets the room, the music momentarily stops as we hear
      Alfonse Simone on the surveillance tape.


                Shh, shh, shh!


                If we have to pay somebody off,
                we'll pay somebody off. If we have
                to lean on somebody, intimidate
                somebody, we'll intimidate
                somebody.

      Richie joyfully lip synchs to the rhythm of Simone's
      incriminating words on tape.


                    (in unison with Simone on
                     tape)
                -- If we have to lean on somebody,
                intimate somebody, we'll intimidate
                somebody!!


















      Irving's big blue car pulls up to the lens. Irving and Sydney
      looking a little uneasy.

      Irving stares at the house.


                I gotta do it.





                What do you mean, there's no sheik?
                What does that mean, "there's no
                sheik"? What does that mean?

      Carmine stares at Irving.


                I want to face you like a man
                because I want to be real now.


                Who is "they"?

      Irving looks distressed. He's a wreck.


                It's the Feds.


                The Feds?


                Yeah.


                Irving -- I'm a good person


                You are!

      Carmine stands up and looks around the room, disoriented, his
      life passing before his eyes.


                I've been doing this for a long
                time, for twenty years. Do you
                think I woulda taken that money if
                it wasn't the right thing to do?




          Hey look, you're a good person I
          know that but in all honesty --


              
          You said that was the only way,
          Irv. You chased me, remember?


          They fuckin' made me do it. What
          was I supposed to do? They had Syd
          in jail.


          You made me go back to the Plaza to
          take that money, you piece of shit!
          I was gone! You fucking prick!




          I was gone, I left!




          Is everything alright? Can I have a
          word with you?


              
          No, please, Dolly, just go
          upstairs. Take the kids and go
          upstairs!


          Alright, alright.


          I want to make this right. I came
          here because I want to make it
          right.

Irving is in tears. Very upset.


          Look at my face. You tell me that
          I'm lying to you when I say that
          everything I do is for the good of
          the people of New Jersey.
          Everything I do is for them. Am I
          lying to you?




          I never had a friend like you
          before.


          I used that money for the goddamn
          casino.


          I got some leverage, alright? I can
          help you out.


          This is all shit. It's all
          bullshit.

Carmine picks up the knife the Sheik gave him.


          Look at this thing. Look at this.
          Ceremonial fucking knife. What is
          this bullshit? Some toy?

He drops it on the table. Irving stares at his friend,
removes his glasses.


          Carmine, Syd and I got a plan for
          you. We can help you out.


          Please get out of my house, Irving.
          Will you please leave? I'm asking
          you nicely, please leave.

Irving gets up to go and is pushed towards the door by
Carmine. Dolly joins Carmine in tears. Carmine's kids stand
on the stairs.


          Get out of our house!


          I don't want to -- 
          I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this
          to happen.


              
          This is not our friend!


          Truly, I didn't mean for this to
          happen.



      Carmine points to his family.


                This is what matters to me most and
                you're crushing it! You're going to
                take me away from them you fucking
                son of a bitch? Get the fuck out!

183   Carmine lunges at Irving and punches him in the face. Irving    183
      goes down to the ground and his glasses fly off his face.

      CARMINE kicks him one last time.


                    
                I just want to make it right.


                Get out of my house. Look what you
                made me do!


                    
                I'm sorry Carmine, I'm sorry.




      Irving staggers out of the house in an emotional daze, one
      hand to his heart, falls to sidewalk with bloody nose and
      broken glasses --




                Irving!





                Your heart pills. Where are your
                heart pills?

      She digs through his pockets, finds the pills, and feeds one
      to him.

      Sydney struggles to help Irving to his feet and together, an
      embattled but surviving couple, they cross the street arm and
      arm. She opens the door and helps him into the car.


                I've got to lay down.




                Just rest.

      She gets in and closes the door.




      They both slump down on the seat, stare at each other,
      emotional, humbled. Sydney gently removes Irving's broken
      glasses. They stare at each other, it is quiet.


                    
                Are you ready?


                Yes.

      They stare at each other.


                    
                I love you.

      She squeezes his hand, raises it to her lips and kisses it.










                Please. Come in. Sit down.

      They all sit.


                Do you know where our two million
                dollars is?


                Two million? (Irving pushes his new
                glasses up the bridge of his nose)
                It's with Victor Tellegio and
                Alfonse Simone.


                No, actually it's not with Victor
                Tellegio or Alfonse Simone.



Richie stands by the window, stares angrily at Irving.


          He fucking knows about it.


          It's gone missing. Did you know
          that?


          Where's it gone?


          That's interesting that you said
          that because while you were on your
          way over here, we got an anonymous
          phone call from someone who said
          that in exchange for immunity for
          the two of you and a reduced
          sentence for Carmine Polito we get
          our two million dollars back.


          That's interesting. That's very
          interesting. I have no idea.


          No idea?


          No idea what you're talking about.

Irving looks at Sydney who looks back at him and shakes her
head. She doesn't know either.


          I got it. I understand how these
          deals are made. See, someone has
          leverage.


          Anthony, fuck them. It's over. We
          got them for wire fraud, it's over.
           You're done.
          You're both done.


          I don't think so.


          Oh, you don't think so?




                Richard, think about it, YOU
                requested the two million. And you
                gave Brenda the account number. We
                didn't do any of that. None of it.
                
                How do we know that YOU don't have
                the money?


                    (Richie looks from Irving
                     to Sydney)
                Am I living in a fucking nightmare
                right now?




                I find this a little offensive.
                Really, I find this a little
                offensive and I don't see that you
                got any sort of solid case against--


                
                Don't let him get in your heads.
                Listen to me, we're dealing with a
                very clever individual.


                Richard, think about it. You got
                some big arrests. You got U.S.
                Congressmen. You look good. You're
                gonna be all over the news. You
                know what doesn't look good? A
                story about gross incompetence








                I have a warrant for --

      Richie looks around disoriented, we cannot see what he sees
      yet.


                I'm sorry, do I have the wrong
                office?
                Is this 701? Alfonse Simone?




          This is 701.






          My name is Roger Thigpen. I've had
          this office for 25 years. I'm a
          divorce attorney.







          You lost two million dollars of
          taxpayer money because you were
          confused about the location and the
          identity of Victor Tellegio's
          attorney?






Where we first saw Irving at the pool party.


          The role of Tellegio's attorney,
          Alfonse Simone, was played by our
          friend Ed Malone --

Camera pans from Irving to Ed Malone:


          the "Cold Cut King of Long Island"--

Ed Malone holds up two packages of cold cuts. Also holding
the cold cuts are the two that frisked everyone at Simone's
office.


          Whose party we were at when Sydney
          and I first met.

Cut to Irving first meeting Sydney.







Ed Malone, dressed as Alfonse Simone, steps to camera to
shake Richie's hand.


          Alfonse Simone.







          People believe what they want to
          believe Richie.


          That's because you conned me! You
          both fucking conned me. You both
          got under me. You did!


          Well that doesn't sound so good,
          either. I mean -- and I don't know
          what you're talking about, but --
          let's just assume you want to go
          with that story. Really? That's the
          story you want to go with? That's
          what you want the New York Times to
          hear? That you got conned by the
          very con men who you forced to
          entrap the members of Congress in
          the first place. That's what you
          want to go with? That doesn't sound
          so good for your whole thing.

Richie looks like he's going to be sick.


          And how ironic that the most
          creative minds, the ones who are
          working hardest to get the economy
          of New Jersey going, those are the
          ones that you round up. And why?
          Because what, they're the easiest
          to go after? And what about the
          real bullshit artists? You didn't
          even come close to the big leagues.
          Those big guys. The money men.


          That's what I was trying to go
          after.




          I'm sorry to tell you, you got none
          of 'em.


          You know, Richard, I think we may
          call you as a witness, but
          otherwise you're done. I think you
          better go home.

Richie disoriented, appeals to Stoddard.


          Stoddard --


          Go on home, Richard.

ELO's "10538 Overture" reprises on the soundtrack.




Camera tilts down from the Federal Building to find Richie
coming down the stairs, emotional. Richie walks wiping his
eyes, his innocence and Edith, lost.




          We took down some very big guys.







          Some of whom were just doing
          business as usual helping their
          communities or their states.





          But some of them knew they had
          larceny in their blood--










                And they even admitted it.

      GREY HAIRED SENATOR HORTON MITCHELL, wife by his side, denies
      any wrongdoing and is photographed and humiliated as he then
      sits with her in a Federal car.


                But in all it was six Congressmen,
                one United States Senator, and my
                friend, Carmine Polito.








                We gave the two million back so
                Carmine got the reduced sentence.
                18 months. The loss of his
                friendship would haunt me for the
                rest of my life.





                And when the story was written,
                Richard Dimaso's name was never
                mentioned.












                Syd and I moved in together. And
                Rosalyn --

      ROSALYN IN A NECK BRACE and off white trench coat and
      sunglasses -




          The car is a little dinged up and
          I'm a little stiff but I don't want
          to talk about it.

Irving stares at Rosalyn.


          She would always be interesting.

Rosalyn gets in to a car, revealing Pete Musane in the
driver's seat. Irving leans in.


              
          You know my boss knows you did him
          a solid.


          Yes I did. He never took a nickle
          so they can't get him for nothing.
          I was never going to let that
          happen.

Irving starts to leave --


          Irv.

He stops and looks at her. With red lacquered nails Rosalyn
places her favorite nail finish in his hand.


          I'm done with this nail finish. Bye
          for now. I'll see you next weekend.

Irving nods. Rosalyn drives off with Pete.

Sydney stands with Danny.


          Our conning days were behind us.

Irving and Sydney walk hand and hand with Danny down the
street. Irv drops the nail finish into a trashcan.



          You can fool yourself for just so
          long and then your next reinvention
          better have your damn feet on the
          ground.





      Irving and Sydney admire a piece of art on the wall.


                We got a loan from a bank and were
                able to go gallery legitimate.




      Irving and Sydney sit in front of a banker asking for a loan.


                The art of survival is a story that
                never ends.
