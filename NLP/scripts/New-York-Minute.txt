CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW
MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin
Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after
her but UNSEEN.
She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer,
her BREATHING becoming more labored.
Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench.
Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten
the leaves.
Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with
beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her
racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.


and safety loom half a block down. She pours on the
effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the
door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.


where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN
RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT
HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION
Drew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an ASTHMA INHALER
from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window
in the front door and sees...


The puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to
extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs
it close:

             Where are you going, Jelly Bean?




INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING
CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE 
which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW

From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD,
17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the
shrieking ALARM CLOCK.
With a SIGH, she throws her feet  over the edge of the
bed. Her room is a train wreck.    Grabbing a MatchBox 20
T-shirt from the pile on the bed,  she gives it a sniff.
Good enough. Pulling it on, she   pauses, looks a bit
concerned down at her navel.
A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She
touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins
tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the
source.
She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers:

Parker snickers, types her return from...





This makes her smile.



INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING
Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In
a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer...
... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little
labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath
where it says, "tweezers."
She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray
eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her
other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even.





She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow.
Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and
keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She
reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches
herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too
psychotic.
She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces
them.
Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit.       Grabbing her
WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.

             Morning.
Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water
pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off
the water pick, dries her face.

             Why the young executive look?

             I have my interview at NYU today.
Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new
belly ring.

             No way Mom knows about that.
Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt
down.

             And she never will. At least
             until after I'm married.

             Didn't it hurt?

             Like hell.
Drew shivers.

             Piercings are so... unhygienic.
A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off.






             Breakfast.
Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her
Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of...
... HER SIDE OF THE    BATHROOM which resembles a post-
apocalyptic toiletry    landscape. There's a very clear
line of demarcation    on the counter like the demilitarized
zone separating the    Koreas.
Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but
notices another message on her Blackberry:







Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes
downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein
model-type.

                     
             Hellooo, Warren.
Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces
off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet.
ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking.
Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of
the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered
holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then...
nah.
Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth,
brushes with a finger and spits.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING
Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying
her open DAYBOOK.





DR. QUINN MacLEOD, dressed professionally and obviously
together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and
her husband, PROFESSOR CHARLEY MacLEOD, who ENTERS still
in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head.
As a matter of routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he
takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.

             Morning, Dad.

             Morning, baby.

             How's the book coming?

                     
             Well, sweety, my writing process
             is a lot like a giant
             hydroelectric dam. For a long
             time I just let the great ideas
             build up and build up until the
             sheer weight of them spills over
             and the words just come pouring
             out.

             Still stuck, huh?

             Not a word.
Parker ENTERS with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her
pop, then takes a sat.
Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour
milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super
Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both
hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar.
Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat
toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like
Drew.
Drew spots the BLACKBERRY JPEG of Warren before Parker
can turn it over.

             Another one for the trophy room,
             huh?






             Boys can be fun. You should try
             one some time.

                     
             You ready for your interview?

                     (funny you
                      should ask)
             I've prepared a color-coded
             itinerary based on dividing the
             day into fifteen minute increments
             alternating blue/red, double-
             checked the train schedule,
             confirmed with the Weather Channel
             and rehearsed a couple of
             alternate scenarios last night,
             you know, just to account for all
             the possible glitches.

             We'll take that as a yes.

             I'm proud of you for sticking to
             your plan all these years, sweety.

             I still don't understand why you
             want to finish college in two
             years? What's the big hurry?

             I want to hit the ground running.
             All those football games and the
             partying and the whole dating
             scene. It just seems like a lot
             of wasted time that could be spent
             more productively.

             The Accelerated program would look
             great on your med school
             application.

             Football games I get. But
             partying? A waste of time?
Parker looks to her dad.     He shrugs.






             To each her own.

             Well, Drew.   I have a surprise.
Everybody stops what they're doing for a BEAT.

             I took the day off.
                     
             I'm going into the City with you.

                     
             What -- ?!
Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out
her nose.

             Isn't that great! We can do some
             shopping, have lunch, real girl
             stuff. Won't that be fun?

             If you want to have fun, I'm the
             one who should go, not Mother
             Teresa over there.
Drew is still choking -- pretty badly.

             Let me know if you want me to do
             the Heimlich. It'd be cool to
             have you owe me your life.
WHOOSH!   The granola goes down and she sucks air.

             You okay?

                     
             No... I mean, it's... impossible.
             I've got every minute accounted
             for right up to the interview.
             Blue and red! It won't work.

             I just thought... you know... I've
             been working and we haven't had a
             chance to spend much time
             together...





Quinn, the normally thick-skinned M.D., is tearing up.

             ... and both my babies are going
             away to college next Fall.
She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker
follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.

             Don't be sad, Mom. Just think,
             when Drew leaves for school, you
             won't be losing a daughter, you'll
             be losing an anal-retentive social
             misfit who will be voted most
             likely to die a virgin.
Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder.

             I'm sorry, Mom. It's really sweet
             of you. But don't worry. Parker
             will be living here with you
             forever since no college on earth
             will ever take her.

             Stop it, you two.
Mom blows her nose.

             It's not fair you guys get to go
             into the City and I don't.

             Don't you have a chem test, young
             lady?

             Chemistry? Please. Name one time
             you ever used chemistry in your
             life.

                     
             Good point.

                     
             I use chemistry every day.






             You're a    doctor, Mom. I'm not
             going to    be a doctor. I can't
             even say    the word 'orifice,' let
             alone put    a finger up one.
The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go.
Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the
news that her mother's going to accompany her.

                     
             Time to go.


Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite. Almost
trembling with tension, she ENTERS and immediately sits
down at her desk with her DAYPLANNER, turning to the
present DATE:






             Come on, honey! Let's tear up
             Manhattan!
With a shiver, Drew closes the book, looks up into the
mirror, takes a squirt off her inhaler to calm herself
and tries some self-reassurance.

             You're smart. You're resourceful.
             You'll find a way to make it work.
She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but
something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED.
Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell
phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag.


EXT. DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING
Quinn hops in her Saab.
ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep
breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned
prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in.




RING! Quinn's CELL PHONE goes off. Quinn looks annoyed,
checks the incoming number. Drew closes her eyes and
prays.

                  
          Doctor MacLeod...
                  (beat; winking
                   at Drew)
          I'm sorry, but my itinerary is
          booked solid today. Call Dr.
          Wessels. He's covering for me.
                  
          He did?
                  
          Are you sure it's the baby's head?
                  
          All right. I'm coming.
Frustrated, Mom hangs up and with a look of profound
disappointment, turns to Drew.

          I'm sorry, hon. It's a Blue Light
          special in Maternity. Every bed's
          full and some poor woman is about
          to give birth in the gift shop. I
          have to go in.
Drew musters her best sad, sad face for her mom.

          Ah, darn it, Mom. That's a shame.
          It's like fate is conspiring
          against us.

          I know.

          You absolutely, positively have to
          promise me we'll do it another
          time.

          I promise. I better hurry. Have
          Parker drop you at the train
          station on her way to school, will
          you?
Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss.






             Kill 'em in that interview.

                     
             Mom, you know, I might not get in.

             Are you kidding me? You're Drew
             MacLeod. Nobody's smarter, nobody
             works harder and nobody, and I
             mean nobody, is ever more
             prepared.
Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her
mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street.
With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her
shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you."
This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in
her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course
her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street.

             Hey!   Stop!
Drew takes off running after the car!




Commuters all jump from their cars and into the station.



Parker pulls up to the curb at the station.       Drew
collects her bag.

             Good luck with your interview.
Drew pauses, holding the door open.

             You know, Parker. Chemistry is
             important. When you think about
             it, everything's made of
             chemicals.






             Oh, I'm interested in chemistry.
             Just not the kind with all the
             numbers and stinky test tubes.
Drew shuts the door and hustles off into the train
station. Parker SIGHS, looks to the BLACKBERRY on the
seat next to her.

             Ah, chemistry.


Drew finds a seat.     She neatly folds her jacket and sets
it next to her.
She pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind
her -- just right. Next, she takes out a tiny inflatable
lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. A pen
goes in the little holder. Coffee from her Thermos.
After laying out her interview materials, she turns to
her reflection in the window.

                     
             Professor Spaulding. Good
             afternoon. I'm Drew MacLeod.
An EXECUTIVE takes the aisle seat next to her, and after
a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his
Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away.
EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring
off into their own world, wondering why their life has
lead them to this sad moment when...
... they're all distracted by an AWFUL, AWFUL VOICE
singing Sheryl Crow's "Soak Up the Sun." It's Parker,
wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full
train car.
Drew stares at her, dumbfounded.

             What do you think you're doing?

                     (too loud; with
                      headphones on)
             Looking for a seat.






             This can't be happening. Wait, I
             know. This is one of those Ground
             Hog Day dreams, isn't it?
Drew pinches herself too hard.

             Ow!
                     
             I'm awake now. You're supposed to
             disappear.

                     
             You know, I just got this itch.

             Then scratch it and get back to
             school.

             I couldn't concentrate anyway.
             I'm too... distracted today.

             You're permanently distracted.
             It's called Attention Deficit
             Disorder.
                     (spotting her
                       Blackberry)
             Is this about that chat room guy?
             It is, isn't it?
A look from the Exec reminds Parker of her headphones and
she pulls them off.

             No! It's about spontaneity, which
             you obviously wouldn't know
             anything about.

             I swear to God, Parker, you go
             through boyfriends like Junior
             Mints. It's pathetic.

             Pathetic? You want to talk about
             pathetic?! At least I don't count
             getting accidentally felt up in
             dodge ball as my first date!







             You're going to be eighteen and
             you've never even HAD a boyfriend!
The EXECUTIVE furrows his brow at Drew -- never?

             Is this any of your business?
He goes back to his paper.

             This is ridiculous. I don't    have
             time for this today. Fine.      Don't
             graduate from high school.     Make a
             mess of your life over some
             complete stranger. I don't     care.
             But leave me out. I have
             something important I need    to
             accomplish today, so please    go
             away.

                     
             Would you like this seat so you
             two can fight?

             No thank you.
Drew's ALARM WATCH BEEPS.

             I have to mentally preview my day
             now. I can't talk anymore.
Parker turns to go, then remembers something.

             Uh, Drew? Do you have any money?
             I don't have enough for a ticket.
Drew just rolls her eyes and turns her back on her
sister.
The Executive peers over his spectacles at Parker with
the old paternal reprimand look.

             Please.   Like you never ditched
             school.





Parker's got her headphones back on and is SINGING Uncle
Cracker's "Follow Me," torturing everyone in her car.

          'You don't know how you met me...'
But when she spots the CONDUCTOR ENTERING the front of
the car, she abruptly stops, slips down in he seat and
slides past the COMMUTER LADY next to her into the aisle.

          Excuse me.
Parker heads the opposite direction from the ticket-
taking Conductor and out the back of the train car.


Parker stands by the door, waiting, listening to hear if
the coast is clear.
Sounds good. She cracks the door, steps out on tiptoes,
closes the door and THERE'S THE CONDUCTOR. He smiles.

          Ticket, please.

          Why don't I save the b.s. story
          and just ask you to cut me a break
          this one time because I know
          you've got a big heart and you
          remember what it was like when you
          were young and... and...
                  (off the Conductor's
                   look)
          ... randy?



Parker's on the platform. The Conductor climbs back on
the train into the FIRST CAR.

                  
          I guess you were never young and
          randy!
This is when she sees Drew sitting in the train window,
smiling and giving her a little victory wave.




The Conductor heads up the aisle -- does a double-take
when he sees Drew.

          Very funny.

          Excuse me?

          Let's go.
He takes her by the arm.

          What are you doing?
Drew scrambles to grab her bag, jacket, the little
inflatable lap desk falling to the floor.

          I tried to be nice about it, but
          if you want the police involved,
          this is the way to do it.

          Police?     I didn't do anything.

          No ticket, no train ride.

                  
          No! That's not me! That was my
          twin sister you threw off!

          Young lady, in thirty years I have
          heard every possible line but
          that's the lamest ever.

                  
          She's right there!


No Parker.
He hauls Drew down the aisle but as they EXIT THE CAR,

CLIMBER/MALE MODEL GUY -- they really do CRACK FOREHEADS,








BOTH OF THEM SHAKE OFF THE WOOZIES.     He smiles:

             You okay?

             I'm... ouch.

             She's fine, considering she should
             be in jail.
As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and
Dream Guy share a last look before she's...
... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out.
Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her
wits about her.

             This   can't be happening! I have
             a...   a... little paper thingy.
             What   are they called? Ticket! I
             have   a ticket! It's right...
She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her
hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket
in the mess.
The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as
it pulls away. He just waves, victorious.
Parker    steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor
spots    her. He looks from one sister to the other --
oops,    mistake. But it's too late. Sheepishly, he climbs
inside    and the train is gone.

                     

Parker steps up from behind her.

             You get kicked off, too? Why
             didn't you just buy a ticket?
Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but
Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away.






             Don't.

             What happened to your head?

             Oh, just a minor concussion I
             sustained while the Conductor was
             throwing me off the train because
             he thought I was you sneaking back
             on the train!

             Sorry.

             I'll bet.
Drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the
ticket counter. The WELT on her forehead is gonna be a
doozey.

                       
             I am!    Where are you going?

             To see when the next train
             leaves.

             I already --
But Drew's inside the stationhouse.

             -- did. They said something about
             a delay.
Parker follows into the stationhouse.


Packed with frustrated COMMUTERS. Drew's standing in a
long line at the ticket counter, steaming, turning a cold
shoulder on...
... Parker, who walks right through to the street side.





Parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. She
scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded
COMMUTERS jostle for the few remaining TAXIS.
TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match.
To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS --
standard car service rigs -- sit IDLING, each with a
DRIVER next to it, holding up his sign with his client's
name scratched on it.
An EXECUTIVE  passes her, finger in the air,
signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that read:
"Wilcox."

          That's me.
With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for
him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his
side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind.
Parker raises an eyebrow.    Hm.
The second driver  with a head like a cinder
block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and
holding up a sign, "SCARPELLI."
Parker shoots a finger into the air. This barely gets
his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. Parker signals
again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.


Drew has reached the counter, where a bitter TRAIN CLERK
who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of
angry commuters.

          That can't be.  I have to be there
          before two!

          Well, maybe if you flap your arms
          real fast you can fly there,
          because you won't get there on a
          train.

                  
          What did you just say?





Parker arrives in the nick of time, pulling her by the arm.

             Come on.   Hurry. I got us a ride.

             Let go of my arm.
But Parker drags her away. Drew shoots a look back at
the Clerk, who sticks out his tongue at her.


Parker pulls Drew toward the Town Car.

             What's this?

             A car service.

             Car service? You couldn't have
             called for a...
But Bennie opens the door for Parker like he's done it a
thousand times.

             Morning, miss.

             Good morning. Thank you.   My
             sister's coming, too.
Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only
got this instant to consider. She glances at the
STRANDED MOB descending on a lone approaching CAB,
engulfing it.

             You want to make that interview,
             or not?
Drew lets herself be pulled inside. Bennie shuts the
door and waddles around to his side.



Parker tries to play cool -- Drew's rigid -- angry and
afraid. Bennie checks his invoice.






             So you're headed to the Teamster's
             Hall on Second Street?

                     
             You know, Mister...
She checks his Chauffeur's License up front:        Benjamin
Loyola.

             ... Loyola.

             Bennie.

             Mr. Bennie? We have a slight
             change of itinerary. We need to
             go into Manhattan. 57th and 5th
             will be fine.
Bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit.

             It's pre-paid.     No skin off my
             nose.

                     (whispering
                      throughout)
             Pre-paid? What's 57th and 5th?

                        (whispering
                         throughout)
             Barneys.

             Not Barneys.

             We've got five hours.     Relax.
He FIRES UP the LINCOLN and off they go.
Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's
going on. She leans into her sister and WHISPERS.

             This was supposed to be someone
             else's car, wasn't it?






             So?
Just then, Bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on
the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so Drew can
read:

             'Scarpelli'?   We're supposed to be
             Italian?

             Northern Italian.

             This is so... wrong.

             What? You need to get to that
             interview. We now have a ride.
             We will pay for the ride. End of
             big deal.
This is when Bennie's CELL PHONE RINGS and he answers it.

             Yeah?
                     
             No.  The city.
                     
             What'a you talkin' about?
Bennie glances into the REARVIEW MIRROR, smiling at the
girls...

             I already got 'em.
... but his smile TURNS DOWN AT THE CORNERS as he
listens. The girls exchange doubtful looks. It gets
worse.

             They're right here in the car.
                     
             'Scuse me.
Bennie RAISES THE PRIVACY GLASS but doesn't realize he's
left the intercom button on so they can still hear his
half of the conversation.
The girls are PETRIFIED.






                     
             Not good.

                     
             What's happening?

                      
             Don't you think that's a little
             severe? I mean, they didn't see
             nothin' yet. They can't hear
             nothin'.
YES THEY CAN and they're now scared as hell.

             You're the boss.
                      
             Take it easy. I'll fix it.
                      
             No, I don't have a shovel. Not
             today. It'll be a big mess.
             Besides, I just had this suit
             cleaned.
The girls want OUT OF THIS CAR!

             I'll take 'em to the wharf, what
             difference does it make?
Drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it.

                      
             Parker, I think maybe we should
             get out.
Parker sees the LIGHT AHEAD TURN RED.

             I agree.   How about... NOW!
Just as Bennie brakes for the light, Parker throws her
door open and pulls Drew into the street!
An ONCOMING BUICK LOCKS UP its BRAKES as they dash for
the sidewalk.

             Hey?!   Where you goin'?!




They hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race
around the first corner, looking back over their
shoulder.

           He's stuck at the light!
VRROOOM!   Here comes the Lincoln storming around the
corner.

           He has no respect for traffic
           laws!
They run into the first ALLEY and hunker down by a
GARBAGE CAN. The Lincoln flies past. They dash back
out, the same way they came.
SCREECH!   Bennie LOCKS UP the WHEELS!
They round the same corner going the opposite way and
Parker pulls them into the first door...


... where they crouch down the magazine rack. Among the
magazines is DOG FANCY with a picture of a Chinese
Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: "EMPEROR

Parker peers over the top and out the window.
PARKER'S POV -- slowly, the Lincoln cruises the street,
Bennie scanning the neighborhood for them.

           Is he gone? I can't believe this.
           What did you get us into?

           We lost him.    Wow. That was a
           rush.

           A rush?   Are you out of your mind?

           Hey.   Give me a quarter, will ya?
Spooked, they both turn to find a scraggly HOMELESS GUY
with a Slushee in his hand. They stand. Parker reaches
in her pocket.






             Get outta here, Uncle Jerry!

                     
             I don't have any change, but here.
Parker starts to find the Homeless Guy a dollar but Drew
reaches over to stop her...

             Parker, you're only feeding the
             poor man's disease. Buy him a
             healthy snack.
... just as the Homeless Guy reaches for the dollar and
the SLUSHEE IS KNOCKED FROM HIS HAND.
We watch in SLOW MOTION AS THE SLUSHEE TAKES FLIGHT, THE




The Homeless Guy snags the dollar.

             I gotta go.
And he EXITS.     Parker SNIFFS.

             Ew. That stinks. That's not just
             Slushee.
The MINI-MART CLERK approaches them, shaking his head.

             It's Mad Dog. Look at that mess.
             It's gonna smell up the store all
             day.
Drew appears STUNNED, unable to form words so Parker
speaks for her.

             May we use your bathroom please?
The cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down
Drew's blank face.

             Gas station at the end of the
             block. Have a nice day.




BURT, who has no teeth, hands over the restroom key to
the girls. The key is attached to a full-sized STEERING
WHEEL. Burt SNIFFS, wrinkling his nose.

          You know, it's not my place to
          say, but you young girls got your
          whole lives ahead of you. You
          shouldn't be drinkin' at this hour
          of the day.

          That's what I keep telling her.

          'Round the side.


The girls practically have to drag the key around to the
restroom on the side.
Parker puts the key in and slowly... slowly...
CREAKING... opens the GATES OF HELL








Sitting side by side. A YOUNG MOTHER sits in front of
them with her NINE-MONTH-OLD BABY who's standing on the
seat facing the girls.
Drew's BUMP on her forehead is large and inflamed, her
hair a stringy, ratty mess of booze and red-dye number
four and glucose. She is in a REALLY BAD MOOD, only
staring straight ahead.
Parker's playing peek-a-boo with the baby and trying to
lighten up her sister's mood.

          Everything's going to be fine.
                  
          Peek-a-boo!







                     
             We're practically there. We'll
             get you cleaned up, you'll get
             into the program and...
                     
             Peek-a-boo!
                     
             ... we'll both look back on this
             and laugh our butts off.
BLECCH! The BABY PUKES all over Drew.       She looks
sideways at her sister.

             I will never, ever, forgive you.


The bus pulls over then pulls away, leaving the girls on
the sidewalk.

             See?   New York. We made it.

             I could be arrested for vagrancy
             looking like this.

             Listen.   I've got an idea.

             No. No ideas. I'm going straight
             to that interview and wait,
             without moving or speaking,
             especially to you, for four hours.

                     
             Come on! We're going to the
             Plaza! We can be Eloise! We'll
             get a nice room, you can take a
             shower and I'll swap clothes with
             you! Simple as that!

             Do you have the slightest clue
             what that would cost?






             So? You've got the emergency
             credit card Mom gave you, right?
Drew's suddenly looking at her EMPTY HANDS.

             What's wrong?

                      
             Oh.   My. God.

             Where's your, uh, stuff?

                     
             I left it in his car.

             Oh.

             He knows where I live. He's going
             to hunt me down and kill me.

             Come on, Drew. I don't think even
             the Mafia kills people just for
             scamming a ride. Quit being
             paranoid.
                     
             So, we don't do the Plaza. I've
             got...
Parker digs in her pockets.

             Six dollars and thirty-two cents.

             That won't get me hosed down at a
             car wash.

             What are we thinking? You've got
             your secret-safety twenty!

                     
             My secret-safety twenty. Of
             course. But it's only for
             emergencies.





Parker looks her sister right in the eye.

             Yeah.
Drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls
out a twenty, then realizes:

             Hey, how'd you know about my
             secret-safety twenty?

             That's not important now. But
             let's just say that it's a good
             thing for you I think those shoes
             are so ugly I never borrowed them.
                     
             Hey, how about there?
Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads:


             No. I want to get clean, not
             contract hepatitis.

                     
             Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six
             cents.

             We touch nothing.
Parker leads them inside.


This looks like a good place to get your throat cut
fighting over a dime's worth of crack.
There's no real       lobby, just a small area to stand at the
"desk" which is       behind iron bars. Behind the iron bars a
rabbit-eared TV       with a busted-in tube houses a dead
houseplant. An        old easy chair leaks stuffing.

                       
             Hello?    Anybody?





Above, a BABY SCREECHES. Something BREAKS.        Then a
DISEMBODIED VOICE SPEAKS to them.

             Keep your pants on. What'dya
             want?
The girls look behind them, nobody.       Behind the bars?
Still nobody. What the hell?

             I don't got all day.

                     
             We need a room... with a shower.
             Just for an hour.
There's the sound of something SCRAPING across the floor
and then the MIDGET HOTEL CLERK appears behind the
counter. Now he's standing on a STOOL and we don't know
what he was doing behind the counter.

             Sixty bucks.

                     
             Hi.

             You want the room or not?

             Sixty dollars an hour for this --

                     (interrupting;
                      covering)
             -- really nice place. How much
             for half an hour.

             Maybe if you two were in school
             you could figure out that half a
             sixty is thirty.

             We've only got twenty-five.






             You think because I'm short you
             can just charm me into making some
             deal, is that it?

             No, not at all.

             It's all we have. Twenty-six
             dollars and thirty-six cents.

             Are you the one that stinks so
             bad?

                     
             I had a little accident, okay?

             All right, all right, don't    get
             your underwear in a bunch.     As a
             public service, just 'cause    you
             stink so bad, you can have    it for
             twenty-five.
He retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach
between the bars.

             Ten-dollar deposit on key.

             What part of 'That is all the
             money we have' didn't make sense
             to you?

             Sir,   that's every last cent we
             have   in the world. I swear to
             you,   we aren't planning to steal
             your   key.

             I give you some special deal, the
             next thing you know, you two are
             telling everybody, hey, this
             midget was a real sap. We gave
             him some sob story and the little
             guy just busted up into crocodile
             tears and handed over the key.






             I promise we won't tell anyone.
             Will we, Drew?

             Not a word.      Girl Scout's honor.
He grudgingly holds out the key for Parker, who takes it
and hands it to Drew while she gets the money out.
ON DREW -- sensing something, she looks down at her feet
where a HUGE RAT is licking the sweet stuff off her
shoes.
There's a rather LONG BEAT while this horror sinks in,
then:


Key in hand, Drew makes a beeline out the door.

             Drew?!   DREW?!
Parker follows her.

             Come back with my key!
The Desk Clerk jumps off his stool, opens his cage and
follows them into the street.


Panicked, Drew sprints down the sidewalk with Parker and
the Desk Clerk in tow.
Laying the hammer down, the Desk Clerk blasts past Parker
-- he's a midget, but he's got wheels.

             Drew!    STOP!




A WOMAN is giving birth. Her husband holds her hand.
Quinn and a nurse are at her feet.






             Mrs. Greenspan? You're going to
             have to help. I need you to push.
But they don't have her attention which is riveted on...





             Did you see that?

             Honey?   The baby? Please?



"TODAY SHOW" SECURITY GUARDS and NYPD descend on the
crowd.

             All right.   Who's the wise guy?
Parker pulls Drew out of the pile-up and grabs the key,
tossing it away from them, sending the Desk Clerk
scrambling after it.
The two girls HIGH TAIL IT around the corner.       Winded,
they stop.

             Man, that little guy could really
             motor. Why'd you bolt?

             There was a rat, Parker. A rat
             the size of a Doberman eating my
             foot.

             That was all our money.

             Our money?   OUR MONEY?!

             Key down, you're going to have an
             attack.





Drew's sucking on her inhaler but is so irate she spits
out the words.

             Parker, it was not 'our' money and
             this is not 'our' day in New York.
             What it is, is quite possibly the
             most important day of my life.
             I've resigned myself to the fact
             that you don't give a crap about
             what you do with yours, but if you
             could find it in your heart, your
             tiny, cold steel heart, to respect
             what this means to me, I would
             appreciate it.
But Parker's not listening.       She's staring intently...
... ACROSS THE STREET where several TOWN CARS are parked,
the DRIVERS chatting next to a HOT DOG/PRETZEL CART.
Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee.       Parker spots him
and freezes.

             You're not even listening. That's
             typical. Look, we're splitting
             up. Give me back my secret safety
             money.

                     (still looking past
                       Drew)
             You know how I told you not to be
             paranoid?

             Paranoid?

             What I meant was, it isn't
             paranoia if someone really is
             chasing you.
Parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that Drew
should look across the street.

             What's wrong with your eyes?

                     
             It's him.





Drew finally turns and she, too, freezes.

             Quiet.   Don't run. He'll see us.
Not wanting to draw his attention, the Girls shuffle off
quickly down the street.
ON Bennie -- squinting across at them. Can he make them
out in the crowd? He nods to ANOTHER DRIVER, tosses his
coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.


The girls break into a run.

             How'd he find us?

             Maybe it's just coincidence!

             Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERE

She points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th.   Oops.

             Come on!
Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they
weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE
CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute,
Parker spots a fresh pile of...
... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew,
however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her
eyes.

             Jump!
Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow
manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT,
we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it.
Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and
puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits
in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass.
This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch
inside some revolving doors.




IN THE STREET, Bennie's getting up, brushing the crap
off. When a CAB HONKS at him, he gives it an Italian
salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the curb
it's clear: He's lost the girls.



          I don't want to do this anymore.
          I want to be done. No more rats,
          no more mob hit men.

          Well, Cinderella, your wish has
          come true.
                  
          Voila, La Plaza, mademoiselle.

          So?     Hello?   No dinero?

          Yeah. I've got what I'd like to
          call a 'creative solution' to
          that.

          No.     I'm calling Mom.

          What good will that do?

                  
          I'll have her... uh...

          Have her what? Hi, Mom? Could
          you leave that baby halfway outta
          there and drive into the city?

          Dad, then.

          Dad, hey. Drew. Complete loser.
          Couldn't get to an interview by
          myself, need full bail out. Yeah.
          I'm the one who was going to
          change the world, I just couldn't
          get across town.






             Damn it, Parker, my itinerary is
             shot to hell! Blue, red --
Her WATCH ALARM BEEPS.

             I don't even know what that means!
             I'm running out of time.
                     
             Is that guy looking at me?
Parker starts to look.

             Don't look.

             When you ask a question like that,
             the person is going to look.
Drew drags her behind a palm. Sure enough, across the
lobby, a guy dressed as PLAINCLOTHES HOTEL SECURITY
 now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on
them.

             I think he was.

             Drew, we haven't done anything.

             Yeah, but I'm standing in the
             lobby of the Plaza looking like a
             deranged street person who might
             attack at any moment. In fact, I
             might attack at any moment.
The ELEVATOR behind them opens.

             Let's go.
The girls slip into the elevator.     When it closes,
Morty's watching.


The girls climb out of the elevator and sneak to the end
of the hall where Parker stops and peers back around the
corner.






                     
             What are we doing? And why am I
             whispering?

             We're getting you a shower. Blake
             Greer pulled this at the Sheraton
             after the prom.

             Great. Now we're emulating Blake
             Greer, voted most likely to commit
             a felony before having to shave.

             We're not going to steal anything.
             We're just going to sneak in, use
             a little soap and water and get
             out.

             Oh, we're not going to steal
             anything. Super. Just a little
             'breaking and entering.'

             We're not going to break anything.
                     
             We are going to enter, however.

             No.   No.   No.

             Shhh... here comes somebody.
DOWN THE HALL a door swings open and MR. AND MRS. LO
BIANCHO, wealthy Bostonians, EXIT their suite.


REVEALS -- at the opposite end of the hallway, Parker and
Drew aren't the only ones watching. A PAINTER with one
lazy eye, ROGER, pauses with his roller and carefully
peeks around the corner.

             It's the New York Kennel Club,
             Emile, not the New York
             Knickerbockers. Please call the
             caterer and cancel the beer.





The ELEVATOR OPENS       for them and they step in. Parker
RUNS LIKE HELL for       the door of their suite... it's just
about to close when       she SLIDES LIKE PETE ROSE INTO FIRST,
just getting a hand       on it.
She lies there on the floor, holding the door and
WHISPERS LOUDLY to Drew.

             Hurry up!

             No!

                     
             I didn't want to have to do this,
             but... look in the mirror behind
             you.
ON DREW -- bracing herself, she turns slowly.



Practically sewn to Parker, Drew follows her into the
suite, both nervous, tiptoeing.

                     
             Housekeeping?




At the end of the hallway, the PAINTER watches the suite
door close. Hm. What are those girls doing?


It's lavish, yaddada yaddada.

             I can't do this.

             Drew, you're not a criminal. You
             just smell like one. This way.





Parker leads her to the big double doors of the master
bedroom and slowly OPENS them.
There, on the bed, is THE EMPEROR, defending champion of
the New York Kennel Club Dog Show. A CHINESE CRESTED
HAIRLESS with his little crown sticking straight up, he
may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. He simply
eyes them. He might even be smiling.

             Oh, no.  Oh my god. A... a...
                     
             What the hell is it?

             A dog?

             I'm itching already.   See?   Are my
             arms red?
Drew backs away -- she's about to break for the door.

             Key down. I'll take him in the
             living room and keep a lookout.
             You just get in that shower.
Parker approaches The Emperor.

                     
             Hi, little guy. You don't look so
             tough, huh? You don't look much
             like a dog, actually. More like
             Woody Woodpecker.
Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps
into Parker's arms.

             You're cute, aren't you, in a
             freakazoidal kinda way.
She takes him into the living room and moves to the door.

             Was your daddy a rat? Is that it?
             Well, I still like you.
Parker, holding The Emperor, opens the door a crack to
keep a lookout.




The hallway's empty.
But The Emperor, feeling frisky, leaps from her arms into
the hallway, then turns TO face her. Come on. Let's
play!



          Come back here, little ratdog.
          Come to Mommy Parker.
Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to
keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to
spook him into running away from her, she steps into the
hallway.



But sure enough, just as she gets close, he turns and
dashes down the hallway.

          Bad ratdog!
She chases him down the hallway     and then around the
corner where they have to dodge     cans of paints, a ladder,
until finally The Emperor slides     on some plastic
sheeting, careens into a can of     mauve paint and is

Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker looks up to see
the Painter  with the now-mauve Emperor in his
arms.

                   
          Wow.   Thank you.

                 Thank you. Bye bye.
          No.
He turns and RUNS for the stairwell door marked
EXIT. Parker, completely baffled, finally calls after
him:

          That's not your dog!      Hey!




as they open   and the HOUSE SECURITY GUY  steps
out, looking both ways and spotting one thing awry...
... a shoe holding open the door to the Lo Bianchos'
suite.



Drew finishes struggling out of the last of her sticky
clothes and gets ONE FOOT IN THE SHOWER WHEN SHE HEARS:

          Hello? Mrs. Lo Biancho? House
          security!

AXIS. Panicking, she grabs the shower curtain, pulling
it off its hanger and covering herself.



The SECURITY GUY snoops toward the bedroom doors. Just
as he reaches for the handle, the door swings open,
SHADOCK, clocking him and dropping him.
Wrapped in the shower curtain, Drew races across the
living room. Just as she reaches the hallway, Parker's
there, also at a dead run and they don't even break
stride.



                  
          There's a man in there!

          Somebody took the dog!
They reach the end of the hallway and are TRAPPED.
Only one out. Parker HUFFS OPEN the window to the fire
escape and they climb out...


... and scurry down the stairs only to find that THE






Parker hangs and then drops onto the top of a DUMPSTER
with one side of the lid still closed, then jumps to the
alley.

             Hurry up!
But DREW'S FROZEN WITH FEAR and to complicate matters,
she's struggling to keep the curtain wrapped around
herself.

             I'll, uh, go around.

             Are you out of your mind?!    It's
             only a little ways! JUMP!


Rubbing his sore head, Morty the Security Guy lumbers
down the hallway.
BEHIND HIM Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho get out of the
elevator:

                     
             When competing in a dog show, best
             to bring one's dog along, yes?

             I thought you had him, dear.

                      
             See?   Empty.
But now they both notice the DOOR to their suite is wide
open.

             Oh, dear God!
The elderly couple do their version of a panicked run
inside.

                     







ON MORTY -- making an abrupt halt. Baby?!          He turns
around and lopes back to the suite.

             Mrs. Lo Biancho? I'm Mort
             Sestero, hotel security.

             Please!   Please help!

             Someone took your baby?

             The Emperor is missing.

                     
             The Emperor is a dog, right?

             Not 'a' dog, no. THE NEW YORK


Morty pulls his RADIO as he backs out the door and heads
down the hall.

                      
             This is Remote One to base, Remote
             One to base. Code 12, I repeat,
             Code 12.

             You goin' to lunch already, Morty?

                     
             Code 12 isn't lunch, Bruce!
             Didn't you read your manual?

                       
             I will.

             Call NYPD.    We have a dognapping.

             A what?






             Just call the damn police and
             patch me through. The Emperor's
             been kidnapped.

             Holy cripes, why didn't you say it
             was political?!

             Political?     THE EMPEROR IS A DOG,


             You want me to call NYPD about a dog?

                     
             I am going to kill you, then fire
             you, Bruce. Got it? Kill, fire.
             That order.



Drew's still FROZEN on the fire escape.

             I can't do it!

             Yes you can!



where Roger appears with The Emperor. Surprised        to see
the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen,       but
they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and       he
quietly makes his way to his VAN (painted on the       back and
sides: "Michelangelo's Painting: A Masterpiece         every
time".

             No I can't!

             Have fun in prison. Under 'Summer
             Internships' on your college
             application, you can write
             'license plate manufacturing.'





Roger's VAN SQUEALS AWAY, drawing Parker's attention.
She glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears
around the corner into traffic.
Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the closed lid of the
dumpster.

                     
             I did it.
Oops, the curtain starts to slip. When she reaches for
it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK --
nosedives into the dumpster. The curtain floats INTO THE
ALLEY at Parker's feet.



             Get out of there!

                     
             Give me... my... curtain.
Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out.        They
hurry off down the alley.
IN THE SECOND STORY FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW -- Morty appears.

             Stop!    Bring back that dog!
MORTY'S POV -- The girls near the end of the alley. A
small dog could easily be concealed under that shower
curtain.
ON THE GIRLS -- running full-tilt, Drew turns to Parker.

             He thinks we have the dog!

             A painter took it!

             A pain --
WHAM! -- Drew's       CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a
BIKE MESSENGER       who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her,
brakes so hard       he flies off the handlebars and lands






It's DREAM GUY from the train and for a confused BEAT
they look into each other's familiar faces where we read
recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then:

             You know, one of us is gonna get
             hurt if we keep doing this.
O.S. SIRENS signal that the police are now involved.

             Hey, complete stranger!      Get off
             my sister!
Parker yanks Drew from underneath Dream Guy.

             I'm, uh, late for this place,
             thing, where I'm supposed to be.
             College. Interview!

             Where at?
But Parker's got her by the arm and she can only call
back over her shoulder...


... before disappearing into the CROWD on the sidewalk.

                        
             Me, too!
AROUND THE CORNER comes Morty who, without time to react,
trips headfirst over Bike Messenger Guy.


The girls weave through the PEDESTRIANS but spot a COP
CAR SCREECHING to a halt in front of them and quickly
take a left into...



Where to now? Thinking fast, Parker pulls on a door --
locked -- the next door SWINGS OPEN as if by divine
providence and two HIGH FASHION MODELS step past them out
while the girls step inside.




Chaos. MODELS, DRESSERS, SYCOPHANTS, "I ONLY DATE
MODELS" GUYS and the famous couture fashion designer,
BOBO, are mid-show and friggin' frantic.

                  
          Where are they?! No more breaks!
          Do you hear me! We have a show to
          do, you nitwits! Models! BAH!
          You have hollow gourds for heads!
          The kind they make those Mexican
          rattles out of!

                     
          Maracas.

          Maracas! Maracas that take coffee
          breaks when I am paying them a

Bobo spots the girls coming through the back door and
physically grabs them both, pushing them at the
Showrunner.

          Hair!  Makeup!
                   
          Daywear!
                   
          Clubbing! Vite!
This is when he gets a load of Drew's matted hair,
running makeup and shower curtain and does a double-take.
Hm. Does he like it?

                  
          Is that Helmut Lang?
                  
          Go!
The Showrunner shoves Drew one way, Parker the other --
Drew looks at her -- what the hell? Parker CLEARLY
MOUTHS: HAIR! MAKEUP! CLOTHES! and TEAMS OF DRESSERS
virtually surround them.
INSIDE THE MOB OF DRESSERS SURROUNDING DREW the HAIR
STYLIST raises his brush and scissors, but PAUSES.
The rest of the team stops, watching him make his
decision. He shrugs.






             Perfection.
He excuses himself and the others begin shoving her into
couture.



And   the DRESSING TEAM surrounding Parker parts, revealing
her   in a very un-Parker-like, super-chic business suit.
She   catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls
her   eyes. Boring.
The DREW TEAM parts and    we are stunned to see they've
chosen to drape her in a    show-stopping couture FREAK SHOW
OUTFIT that is some sort    of marriage between dominatrix
and nun, complete with a    habit and black leather bikini.
ON PARKER who spots Drew and is, for the first time in
the movie, speechless.

             Why does this not surprise me?
THE NEXT MUSIC CUE COMES UP and the SHOWRUNNER grabs
Drew...

             Excuse me, but I'm supposed to be
             going to my college interview.

             That's rich. A model going to
             college. What next? Talking
             monkeys?
... and pushes her through the curtains and...



FLASH go a hundred CAMERAS! Blinded, Drew stumbles
forward on a nine-inch spiked heels down the catwalk.

This is when Drew catches sight of herself on a TV
MONITOR at the end of the walk.





Her first instinct is to RUN, but suddenly THE AUDIENCE


Drew recovers herself a bit.        Wow.   They're clapping for
me?


Parker's watching through the curtains when she spots
Morty leading two NYPD DETECTIVES 
through the back door. Uh-oh.
The Showrunner's holding her arm, waiting to throw her
onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker
takes the initiative and...



... jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she
was born to it.
Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the
APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in
her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and...
... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy
executive! and leans into her sister:

                     
             The hotel guy's here.
The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS
draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into
PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the
artist and they call him out! Bobo! BOBO! AUTEUR!

Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing
kisses and heading for the girls.

                     
             And the police.
Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their
hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot Morty
peeking from backstage, and they TAKE OFF, leaping off
the front of the stage into the audience like punks
jumping into the mosh pit.





The ADORING CROWD holds them up and they CROWD SURF
toward the rear of the room.

             Everybody washed their hands,
             right?


Spotting the commotion, he and the two cops race down the
catwalk. Realizing he'll never get through the crowd,
he, too, leaps off the stage to surf toward them but...
THE CROWD ABRUPTLY PARTS and he does a complete FACE


             I guess that explains why he's a
             security guard.



who bust out the back doors of the large room and
unwittingly...


... right back into The Plaza lobby.

                        
             Perfect.

             Is this what they call 'returning
             to the scene of the crime'?
Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they
have to pass by...
... the PLAZA MANAGER and the other HOUSE SECURITY AGENT,
BRUCE , consoling Mrs. Lo
Biancho.
When MORTY and the COPS come through the doors behind
them, however, there's no choice.
The girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible
heading for the revolving doors but they overhear:






             I assure you, Mr. and Mrs. Lo
             Biancho, The Plaza will do
             everything in its power to see
             that The Emperor is safely
             returned and that the criminals
             are brought to justice.

             Justice?! I want them executed!
             Tortured first, slowly, and then
             beheaded!

             The Plaza's policy is of course to
             serve you in any capacity we can.
Morty spots the girls across the lobby just as they reach
the revolving doors.

                       
             Bruce!    10-80 at the wagon wheel!
Bruce looks over to Morty like he's speaking Slavic, but
Morty's furiously pointing and Bruce sees...
THE GIRLS break for the revolving doors. Parker gets
there first, plunges in so fast that a MAN ENTERING is
tossed headlong into the lobby.
Drew tries to time the quickly-spinning door but one of
the very high SPIKED HEELS catches, throwing her forward
and sandwiching her in the revolving door.

                       
             Park...
OUTSIDE -- Parker sees Drew caught in the door as Bruce,
Morty and the cops close in. Quickly, Parker pushes the
door back, releasing Drew, who jumps in and swings out.


Then, Parker HEAVES THE DOOR WITH ALL HER MIGHT, spinning
it so fast the security guys and cops can't jump in.



The four men all stand there, watching the spinning door.






             Damn it!
Then, just    to their right, an ELDERLY WOMAN walks through
the regular    door just adjacent the revolving doors. All
four share    a sheepish look -- uh, maybe we should have
thought of    that -- then BOLT outside.


The police and security look left, right, across the
street.

             Where'd they go?

             They couldn't have gone very far.
             We'll split up.
                     
             You go that way! You take Fifth!
             Come on, get on your horse!
Morty and Bruce take the cop's order and race off in
separate directions. Neither Hogan nor his partner
moves.

             Coffee?

             Sure.
Williamson and Hogan step over to a hot dog cart set up
next to a NEWSPAPER STAND.

                     
             Two black.

             Where do you think those two went?

             Beats me. They didn't have any
             stupid dog with them from what I
             could see.

             Might have stashed it.






             Maybe they ate it.
The cops giggle at this.

             The rent-a-cop said the mutt's
             worth like 50 G's. That makes it
             grand theft, my friend. Five to
             ten.


where a BLIND CASHIER  smiles at the two
policemen.

                      
             Hey, Speedy. You didn't see a
             couple of blondes run past here,
             did you?

             Yep. Couldn't miss 'em. Real
             criminal types. Looked like they
             were headed to Mexico.

             That's where they all go.



REVEALS Drew and Parker, crouched down behind the counter
right next to Speedy.

             See you around.

             Not if I see you first.
The cops head back to The Plaza.

             I say we put Abbott and Costello
             on the ransom watch. I don't want
             to be stuck in the same room all
             day with Leona Helmsley's nasty
             stepsister.





With the Detectives gone, Speedy turns up his nose and
waves the air, fanning away a bad smell.

             Whew. You know, it's not some old
             wives' tale about blind people
             having an acute sense of smell.

             Sorry.

             So? What did you do with that
             dog?

             We didn't steal it, I swear.

             A painter did.

             You girls best give yourselves up
             and tell 'em the story.

                     
             He's right, Parker.

             Of course he's right. We're going
             to march in there and give
             ourselves up right this minute.
             They will, of course, take us down
             to the precinct, call Mom and Dad,
             we'll give our statement, they'll
             grill us under hot lights for a
             few hours, force us to confess
             with some tricky good cop/bad cop
             routine and the next thing you
             know we're doing five to ten in
             Attica.
Drew checks her watch.

             So we'll turn ourselves in right
             after the interview.

             May I make one suggestion?






             Sure.

             Hit the showers before you do
             anything else.
A BEEP BEEP indicates Parker's BLACKBERRY is receiving a
message.

             We're facing felony charges,
             Parker. Maybe you can do your on-
             line flirting later. Better yet,
             he can see you during visitor's
             hours.
Parker reads the incoming MESSAGE from...


                     
             Oh my God. Warren works in the
             city.

             Warren? WARREN?! So you lied,
             right to my face. No, Drew, this
             isn't about the chat room guy.
             Nah!
But Parker's typing furiously even as Drew rants on --
she has to lean around Speedy's legs. A GUY buying a
newspaper peers down at the strange sight.

                     
             Take your daughters to work day.
The guy pays for his paper, leaves.



             Are you listening to me?!   Give me
             that stupid thing!
Drew reaches for the Blackberry.






             Knock it off, Drew! This guy
             might be able to help. He lives
             here.

             Parker, you have completely lost
             your mind if you can be thinking
             about boys at a time like this!







                     
             The United Nations?

             You can't possibly know somebody
             who works at the United Nations.
             Maybe he meant United Sub
             Sandwiches. Or United Skate Rats
             Store.



Parker pockets the Blackberry.

             So. We're going to the United
             Nations to use the restroom.

             How convenient. You arrange a
             little date while your sister's
             future hangs in the balance.

             Look, he said he'd help and it's
             only a couple blocks away. You
             got a better idea?
Speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand.






                     
             Coast's clear.

             Thank you, Mr. Speedy.

             You're quite welcome.    Good luck
             in that interview.
Drew SIGHS, then reluctantly follows Parker out.


INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - CHARLEY'S STUDY
Head thrown back, mouth wide open, still in his        bathrobe,
Charley sleeps in the chair directly in front of        his
laptop. The SCREENSAVER, an animated version of         Jack
Nicholson in THE SHINING, just keeps typing "All        work and
no play..."
When the PHONE RINGS it nearly knocks him out of his
chair. He hunts it down through the MAELSTROM on his
desk.

                     
             Wal-Mart?
                     
             Hey, Marvin. You bet.    Typing
             away.
He glances at the screensaver, the same words pouring
out.

                      
             Today?
                     
             Gee, I'm on a real roll, Marv.
             The juices overfloweth, if you get
             my meaning. Don't want to plug
             the juices when they're
             overflowing, right?
                     
             How much?
                     
             Hm. I guess I could carve out
             some time.





Charley smells his armpit.       Ripe.   He'll need a quick
shower.

             Got it.   See you in the City.
Charley hangs up, punches a key on his computer.       The
screensaver disappears and up pops a BLANK PAGE.       At the
top: CHAPTER ONE. Nothing else.



Charley's driving,      eating a sandwich and dialing his CELL
PHONE at the same      time, veering dangerously and
obliviously across      the center stripe. The oncoming CAR
careens out of his      way in a blaze of HORN.

                     
             Hello, beautiful Doctor Lady. How
             goes your day?
                     
             Right next to the magazine rack?
             What did they name it, Newsweek?
                     
             I'm going into the City to meet
             some big shot publisher. Maybe
             I'll swing by NYU afterwards and
             see if I can give Drew a ride
             home. You talk to her today?
                     
             She's probably having too much fun
             to call. I'll ring her up. Bye
             bye.
He hangs up and of course veers into the other lane
again, correcting wildly before resuming his merry way.




Far below, Garden employees set      up for the dog show.
Inside, the Lo Bianchos' luxury      box is likewise being
prepared. In one corner, Bruce       and Morty are fumbling
with the unfamiliar electronic      tracing gear, readying for
the ransom call.
Mrs. Lo Biancho turns up her nose at the buffet table.






                     
             What are those?

             Rumaki, ma'am.

             Rumaki! Yech! You might as well
             wrap dog turds in bacon. Take
             them away.
A SOCIETY FRIEND of Mrs. Lo Biancho, BABS, arrives to pay
her respects, shuffling her feet across and leaning in to
trade air kisses.

             Andrea, Andrea. How dreadful!      I
             shudder to think how the poor
             Emperor may be suffering.

             Dear Babs.     I'm at wit's end.
When she turns on Morty and Bruce, they both jump a
little.

                     
             You! Tell the thieves I'll pay
             anything they want! Anything!

             Of course.     What price on a loved
             one?

             Precisely!

             I've got to    run. That stupid
             groomer used    a commercial
             conditioner    on Coco and she looks
             like trailer    trash.
Babs nabs one of the rumaki on her way out. As soon as
Babs is gone, Mrs. Lo Biancho looms over Morty and Bruce.

             I'll give them ten grand, tops,
             but only if the dog's back before
             show time.





A troubled Bruce isn't having much luck operating the
trace machine.

                     (aside to Morty;
                      whispered)
             Do you know how to turn this on?



The girls try to be as inconspicuous as possible walking
cross-town in couture, Drew with only one shoe and in a
bad mood.

             We're going to make it, Drew.
             You'll see. There's still plenty
             of time. You'll get cleaned up,
             we can trade clothes... this is a
             nice suit, huh? Right?

                     
             Yes.

             You're going to get accepted, then
             we can explain the
             misunderstanding about the dog to
             the police and everything will be
             okay.

             Maybe after the police forgive us
             for sneaking into someone else's
             hotel room, we can ask them to
             please keep the mob hit man from
             whacking us and dropping us into
             the marina so he doesn't get his
             suit dirty.

             First things first.

             Parker, I know you're trying to
             cheer me up, but I have to be
             honest. This is all your fault.






                     
             My fault? MY FAULT?! I didn't
             mean for any of this to happen!

             Yeah, right! Like you didn't mean
             to ask Bernie Lipscomb to the
             prom!

             What's that supposed to mean?

             I'll bet that was just another
             accident of yours that happened to
             screw up my life!

             Bernie Lipscomb?
                     
             You...?
Drew didn't want to admit that -- it just slipped out
under pressure.

             You liked Bernie, too?

             You know I did!

             No I didn't.  I haven't seen you
             talk to a guy since we were in
             kindergarten and we thought Jerry
             Wester was a girl.

             You asked Bernie just to snake him
             from me!

             I did not!
                     
             Wow, the really spooky thing is,
             that would mean we liked the same
             guy.
A block away, the United Nations building stands
majestically against the sky.





Directly in front of them, however, a POLICE CAR is
stopped at the light with two uniformed POLICEMEN inside.
The girls spot the Police and stop.
The Police look up at the girls through their windshield.


Their on-board FAX is spitting out an APB PHOTO. The
POLICEMAN on the passenger side pulls it off and holds it
up.



             Isn't that those two right there?
He shows the PHOTO to his PARTNER who's driving.

             I'll be damned.
But when they look up:



-- the girls are gone. They don't take much notice of a
HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE passing them with the DRIVER up
front and TWO TOURISTS kissing in the back.



             Where the hell did they go?
As the carriage clops past, however, the Policemen don't
notice the Girls -- both clinging to the back.

                     
             605 to Base. We spotted the
             dognapping suspects, corner of 1st
             and 49th.

                     
             Copy that, 605.





Hogan and Williamson are eating sandwiches but they've
paused to listen:

                  
          Car 91, 605 reports suspects
          spotted at 1st and 49th.
Hogan picks up the radio while Williamson FIRES UP the


                  
          605, do you still have visual?

          Negative. But they can't be far.
          They're on foot.

                  
          That's over by the U.N.

                  
          See if you can pick them up.
          We're on our way.
Zoom!   Williamson blasts crosstown.



The Horse Carriage passes the usual groups of PROTESTORS
and TOURISTS outside on the U.N. Plaza and...
... the Girls jump off and move into the crowd, headed
for the ENTRANCE where there's a LINE at the door.
DOWN THE BLOCK the Detectives' unmarked car appears and
parks at the curb.
Williamson and Hogan climb out, scanning the crowd.

                  
          There they are.



-- just a glimpse as they ENTER the building.





          What in the world could they be
          doing here?


The Girls pass through the metal detector and move toward
a small group of TOURISTS waiting by the sign that reads:


                  
          Do you see him?
Parker consults the JPEG PIC on her Blackberry, then
scans the group.

          No.
At the head of the group, the U.N. TOUR GUARD, geeky in a
Clark Kent way and nice enough looking but definitely not
a male model, leans into a petite BRUNETTE and her LITTLE


                  
          I can't tell you how much I've
          looked forward to this.
The Brunette looks at him like he's a serial killer.

                   
          Momma?
Her fierce-looking BABUSHKA MOM gets in the Tour Guide's
face.

          Sorry.   My mistake.
This is when Drew notices Williamson and Hogan ENTERING
and approaching a U.N. SECURITY GUIDE, flashing their
badges.

          Oh, shit.   What now?

                   
          Warren? Does anyone know Warren
          Collier?





The Tour Guide, WARREN COLLIER, looks over at them.

             Parker?
Warren moves back to Drew and Parker.

             Gee, Warren. Isn't that strange?
             I didn't recognize you from your
             picture.

             Yeah, I, uh...

                     
             We don't have time for this now.

             Do you have an office or someplace
             private we could go?

             I just have to do this tour and...
But Williamson and Hogan, led by the U.N. Security Guy,
ENTER the lobby.
Drew grabs Warren by the arm and turns him.

             We'll get back to that.

             What's going on?
Parker looks Warren right in the eye.     This is a test.

             It's important.

                     
             Okay. Let me get somebody to
             cover for me.
Warren leads them into a small adjoining office...


... where another TOUR GUIDE is taking a break.






             Hey, Angie, take the 11:00 for me,
             will you?

             No way.    Judge Judy's on.
Drew grabs Angie by the collar, lifts her up.

             Angie?    Take the 11:00.

                     
             You owe me, Warren.
Angie heads out to take the tour.        Parker turns on
Warren.

             Are you a lying sack, or what?

             What was I supposed to do? I
             liked you. If I'd sent a real
             picture, would you have met me?

             That's not the point.

             That means no. At least this way
             I got to see you before you blow
             me off.

             No one is blowing you off, Warren.
             As a matter of fact, we're very
             happy to see you, aren't we,
             Parker?

             I guess.

             And we're grateful for your help.

             This is my sister, Drew.

             Not-a-twin, huh?






             That's a joke.

             Yeah, well. I guess everybody
             would like the world to see them a
             little bit differently than they
             are.

                     
             Super. Now that that's all
             settled, is there a restroom I can
             get to without going out there?

             What's wrong with going out there?

             Police, for one thing.

             Police?   I thought you guys were
             joking.

             It's the kind of joke that will be
             a lot funnier a few years from now.

             Well that door's the only way out.
             There's a restroom at the end of
             the main hall.
Parker opens the office door, peeking out.

             They there?

             I don't see 'em.


who Parker can't see because her line of sight is blocked
by the office door.




             They must be searching the
             building.






             What'd you guys do, anyway?    Mug a
             couple supermodels?

             Let's go.
With Warren leading the way, they EXIT the office.


The three make their way across the vast lobby, but
before they reach the main hall...

                      
             Hey!   You two! Stop!

             This way!
Almost instinctively, they go COMPLETELY SEPARATE WAYS,
Warren and Parker breaking left, Drew right.
Drew makes a mad dash down a hallway, makes a turn,
another turn, working her way deeper into the labyrinth.
Even while running frantically, she tries to smile
politely at everyone she passes until she spots a WOMEN'S
room and quickly ditches inside.



She hurriedly crosses, enters a stall, locks the door and
puts her feet up. She tries to catch her breath.
GROANS OF PAIN ECHO from the stall next to her.
Somebody's in BAD SHAPE.      Another HEART-RENDING GROAN
can't be ignored.

                     
             Are you okay?

                     (near fatally
                      nauseous)
             Ohhh... I'm so sick. The mussels
             at lunch. You have to help me.






             I'm kind of in my own private hell
             right now.

             What's your name?

             Drew.

             Drew... it's vitally important.
A FILE FOLDER comes skidding from under the stall.

             Please.    You have to take this to
             Canada.

             Uh, Canada?    It's sort of far away.

                     
             In the Assembly. Give the file to
             Mr. Wakefield, the Canadian
             representative.

             Please. I can't... get up.

             You want me to take this to the
             Canadian Representative to the
             United Nations?

             Hurry!    This is a crisis!
What can she possibly do?

                       
             Okay.
Drew EXITS the stall and goes to the door.

             Where's the Assembly?

             To the left.    Run!
Drew peeks out the door.       It looks clear.   Out she goes.





On the run, Warren and Parker ditch through a door marked
MAILROOM. A BEAT LATER, Hogan appears from around the
corner.


Vacant and quiet. The DOOR OPENS SLOWLY and Hogan
ENTERS. It's a small room with a few canvas mail sacks
piled in a corner and a wall of mail-sorting cubbies.
An in-house MONITOR mutely broadcasts the now empty

Nothing here, Hogan closes the door. IN A BEAT, one of
the mail sacks wriggles and Warren sticks his head up.

          He's gone.
Parker pops up from the same sack. Face to face, there's
an awkward moment of attraction between them.

                  
          You have nice breath.

          Thank you.
                  
          Maybe we should get out of this
          sack.




Drew peeks in through the door, reading the COUNTRY
IDENTIFICATIONS on the desks... Bangkok, Borneo,
Bulgaria... Canada.
The REPRESENTATIVES are in the middle of a heated DEBATE
that we hear being translated .

                  
          Impossible! This would be
          globally destabilizing!

                   
          Hah!   Posturing and rhetoric!





The CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE is sitting gingerly in his
chair, shifting uncomfortably. He looks pale, shaky.
Drew commits herself and rushes down the stairs to his
desk with the file.

                      
             Sir?
He puts a hand to his stomach -- he's struggling.

                      
             Yes...

             Oh, no. You didn't have the
             mussels at lunch, too, did you?
Even as she holds out the file, he races past her,
puckering his bum.
She watches him waddle up the stairs BUT AS HE EXITS, HE


Drew sees them. Uh, oh. The only thing she can do to
make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian
Rep's chair and turn her back on them like she's one of
the Assembly members. She sits up, shuffles the files
around.
Glancing furtively to either side, she sees that everyone
else is wearing the TRANSLATION EARPHONE. She puts one
on.


Williamson's gaze comes to rest on...
... THE BACK OF DREW'S HEAD.         Hm.   That looks familiar.
This is when the CHINESE REP stands, furious, and points
an accusatory finger at Drew!

             This crisis falls at the feet of
             one nation and one nation only!








             How do you defend such a position!
             The world is waiting to hear!
These are fighting words. The Assembly grows SILENT.
Drew wishes she could BEAM HERSELF somewhere off planet.
She gulps air. Glances left, right.



             Well, I'm not certain...
This furrows some brows.

                     
             ... that I NEED to defend our
             position!
Ah, yes, some knowing nods.
ON THE NORTH KOREAN REPRESENTATIVE leaning over to confer
with the NORWEGIAN REPRESENTATIVE:

                     
             Is she new?

             Beats me.

             She's hot.

             Weird hairdo.



             That is absurd!

             Absurd?!
Uhhh... where now? She notices the FILE the Rep in the
bathroom gave her and holds it up, shaking it for
emphasis.






                     
             Not so absurd, since I have the
             documents right here in my
             possession!
This draws a CHORUS OF MURMURS throughout the hall. The
Chinese Rep suddenly looks terribly worried and pauses to
confer with his ASSOCIATE.



Parker's peeking through the door, checking the hallway.

             How are we going to find Drew?

             Something tells me that won't be
             too tough.
Warren points to the MONITOR. Parker's jaw drops.         Her
sister is addressing the entire U.N. Assembly.




Drew glances Williamson EXITING.

             And besides, who said absurd is
             necessarily bad? Sometimes absurd
             is good! For instance, absurd can
             be sort of... funny! In conclusion,
             I propose that all of you should
             talk amongst yourselves.
                     
             Thank you.
Like Cinderella at Midnight, she turns and races up the
stairs as the Assembly is in complete turmoil -- KOFI
ANAN BANGS his gavel.

             Canada has proposed further
             debate.

             The United States of America
             seconds the motion!




Drew busts through the doors just as Warren and Parker
come running with the Detectives chasing them. The three
of them make for the front door but a TOUR GROUP comprised
of a hundred young JAPANESE GIRLS blocks their EXIT.
Warren thinks fast and YELLS IN JAPANESE.

          Jin zshe miya BRAD PITT!
SCREAMING LIKE BANSHEES, the Japanese Girls all pour
outside, Warren and the Girls following.


Once outside, he YELLS AGAIN.

          Dingo cashito, BRAD PITT ezukai!
The JAPANESE GIRLS turn around and STORM BACK THROUGH THE
DOORS, blocking Williamson and Hogan's EXIT.
The three of them run for the line of taxis.

          You speak Japanese?

          I may not look like an underwear
          model, but I'm smarter than a
          hundred of them put together.
Warren grabs a Taxi door.

          Come on!

          We don't have any money!

          I'm smart AND rich!
Williamson and Hogan have fought their way out through
the little Japanese Girls.
Realizing they won't reach Parker and Drew in time, they
head for their own unmarked cruiser which is parked just
ahead of...
Bennie's TOWN CAR. He's holding the door for a cigar-
chewing CLIENT but watching the Girls climb into the cab
up ahead.




They jump into the back seat, Warren in the middle.
Parker leans urgently into the DRIVER:

          Follow that... uh...

          They're following US, Parker!

          Oh, yeah.   JUST GO!
The TAXI pulls away from the curb.


Williamson FIRES UP the CRUISER.

          Maybe we should give them a little
          leash and see what they do with
          it.

          Fine. But we're gonna have to
          stop for lunch pretty soon, 'cause
          I'm getting heartburn.
They pull into traffic, following the Cab.
In a BEAT, Bennie's Town Car follows, too.



Parker leans across Warren to Drew.

          Excuse me, what were you doing?

          Someone was sick in the bathroom
          and they asked me to -- hold on, I
          don't owe you any explanation.

          You're the one all 'I gotta get to
          this interview or I'm gonna have a
          nervous breakdown' and yet you
          have time to address the United
          Nations?






             You know, technically, you have to
             have security clearance to enter
             the Assembly.

             Not now, Warren.

             You have a lot of nerve, Parker.
             It was you that got me tossed off
             the train! You had to give the
             bum that dollar! You get the
             suit, I get the leather bikini!

                     
             Which isn't so bad.

             And you got Bernie Lipscomb while
             I got Scrabble with Mom and Dad!

             Who's Bernie Lipscomb?

             I told you, I didn't know you
             liked him! It was no big deal!

             It was to me!

             How could I know? You never tell
             me anything!

             There's a good reason for that!

             What's that supposed to mean?

             You know very well what it means,
             Ms. Big Mouth!

             Big mouth?! Ooh, I hope you miss
             that stupid interview!






             Oh yeah? Well, the joke's on you,
             because there isn't any interview!
Oops. This just slipped out in anger.        Parker's brain
has to adjust, then:

             What?

                     
             No interview. I screwed up.

             You screwed up what?

             Scheduling the interview.    You
             deaf?

             You're Drew. Drew doesn't screw
             ANYTHING up, let alone scheduling.
             You're the Iron Chef of
             scheduling.

             I missed the deadline.

             How?

             After they made the first cut from
             the preliminary application, we
             were supposed to send in a form to
             secure our interview time and I
             filled it out and had everything
             ready to go in the mailbox and
             then...
Drew is near tears.

             And then what? Earthquake?
             Tsunami? Nuclear winter?

             I forgot.

             Forgot?






             Yes. I just forgot. When I found
             it in my bag a week later, I'd
             missed the deadline.

             So today?   All this?   What are you
             doing?

                     
             I... I was going to try to meet
             Professor Spaulding and...

             You were just going to jump him?

             Sort of a guerilla interview?     You
             know, I'm a big Michael Moore
             fan...
A look from Parker quiets Warren.       Drew's choked up.    She
just nods, yes.

             I called and the secretary said
             there were no exceptions to the
             deadline so I was going to try to
             see him when he finished the other
             interviews. I knew it was
             hopeless, but... I was so...
             embarrassed.
Drew wipes her tears, then:

             Oh, to hell with it.
She opens the door and jumps out!

             Drew?!   Drew, get back in this
             taxi!
Parker starts to open her door on the TRAFFIC SIDE! HONK
HONK! It's nearly SHEARED OFF by a passing truck and she
closes it just in time.

             She's pretty upset.






             Gee, you really are a genius.
As the taxi bogs down in traffic, Drew disappears around
the corner up ahead.

             Talk about spontaneous.


Tears running, Drew's walking too quickly for the one
stupid shoe. She nearly turns her ankle.

             Darn it!   DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT!
This is when she sees, parked just down the block...
ROGER'S VAN with "Michelangelo's Painting" across the
back door.

             That's... that's the painter.
Drew quickly steps into the shadow of a doorway to keep
out of sight and watch the van.




Williamson and Hogan have the same problem with the
traffic and can't see clearly what's going on up ahead.

             Did one of them just get out?

             I think so.   Maybe she's going for
             the dog.

             Maybe that's what they want us to
             think.

             So we stay with the taxi?






             Unless you want to hoof it after
             the other one.

             We stay with the taxi.


Roger dials a cell phone while The Emperor stands on the
passenger seat with his front paws on the dash. As far
as we can tell, he's having a great time being kidnapped
and doesn't mind being mauve.

             Get in the back, will ya?
The Emperor ignores him, happily watching the streets of
New York go by.

             Stupid dog.
But his CALL has gone through.        He imitates a GIRL'S


                      
             Hello?





Mrs. Lo Biancho calmly answers her cell phone.

             Yes?
Morty and Bruce have their tracing gear rigged to her
phone but have to keep following her around the box.

                     (Girl Voice
                      throughout)
             If you want to see your dog alive
             again, listen closely. I want a
             hundred thousand dollars
             transferred into this numbered
             Swiss account --






                     
             -- I'll give you ten grand but
             only if he's in Madison Square
             Garden in...
She looks to her husband, who consults his watch and then
holds up ONE FINGER.

             One hour.   Take it or leave it.
Bruce SIGNALS her -- keep him on the line!

             You have one minute to decide.
She hangs up.     Bruce and Morty SIGH.


Roger looks at the phone. It wasn't supposed to go like
that. He looks at The Emperor.

             Well, Mr. Fancy Pants. You can
             wipe that stupid smile off your
             face. I don't think they love you
             as much as you think they do.
He glances at his watch.      He believes Mrs. Lo Biancho and
is PANICKING.



Parker and Warren are scanning the sidewalk ahead for
Drew.

             Where'd she go?

             I think she took a right up there.

                     
             Follow my sister.

             I thought we were the ones being
             followed.






             Stay flexible, will you please?
They turn right.


He hits redial.       Mrs. Lo Biancho answers.

             Yesss?

             Okay.    Here's how we make the --

                     
             -- First of all, you forgot to
             disguise your voice.

                        
             Damn it!

             Secondly, my husband will meet you
             in ten minutes on the corner of
             43rd and Broadway. He'll have the
             money. Bring the dog.

             But that's ridiculous!     You'll
             just bring the police!     No way!
             Consider him Kung Pau!

             Fine.

             Don't hang up!

             The police, it appears, have other
             priorities, like humans or
             something. And I assure you, the
             Hotel Security... people... will
             not interfere. In any case,
             little man, we just want the dog
             back before showtime, do you
             understand?






                       
             Okay.

             Ciao.
She hangs up.        Roger does, too.

                     
             No wonder you look so happy. As
             far as you're concerned, you've
             escaped from the Wicked Witch of
             the West.


Drew watches as Roger climbs out, looks up and down the
street, then moves around to the passenger side, grabs
The Emperor and drops him into a gym bag.
AT THE END OF THE BLOCK -- SPECTATORS for the New York
Kennel Club Dog Show have begun filing into the Garden.
Ever wary, Roger carries The Emperor under one arm. The
Emperor pokes his nose out. Roger pushes it back in.
The dog pokes it back out.

                     
             Knock it off.
Whoosh! From behind, DREW GRABS THE EMPEROR and takes
off running.

             Hey!    Give me that dog!
Holding The Emperor at arm's length, Drew makes a run for
it with Roger after her.



             I just want you to know that I'm
             allergic to you AND cynophobic!
She and Roger race right past...
... Mr. Lo Biancho, holding out the Saks bag of money.






             Excuse me?

             I can't stop!    I have to return
             this dog!

             I'll be right back!
Puzzled, Mr. Lo Biancho falls in line behind Roger,
keeping up pretty well for an old dude with a gut.










             Uh, isn't that your sister?

             It can't be.    She's terrified of
             dogs.


They round the corner behind Parker and Warren.

             I'm telling you, I got a hunch
             these girls don't have anything to
             do with this dog.
Drew blows past them, holding The Emperor. The
Detectives exchange glances -- nice hunch -- and they



Just as he turns the corner, the PARADE PASSES HIM.   What
the hell?




The Emperor's having the time of his life. He licks
Drew's face joyfully as she weaves through the growing
crowd.


REVEALS A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN doing security at the
DELIVERY ENTRANCE to the Garden, where SHOW PARTICIPANTS,
wheeling their DOG KENNELS, are being checked in by two




Drew draws a bead on THE POLICEMAN, determined to reach
him and hand over The Emperor:

          Officer?!   Officer?!
But SHOW OFFICIAL #3 appears from inside, taps the
Policeman on the shoulder -- they need him inside.   He
turns and goes through the door just as...
... Drew reaches the loading dock and hustles up the
stairs.

          Officer?!
She sprints past the other SHOW OFFICIALS checking in


          Miss! You can't go in without
          credentials!



Drew has entered HER OWN PERSONAL CIRCLE OF HELL -- DOGS


                  
          Where's the Policeman?
A GROOMER combing a HOUND DOG points toward the CURTAINS
on the far side of the room and she blasts off that
direction.





CLOSE ON THE HOUND DOG -- lifting his big nose in the
air, he sniffs mightily and then...
BAYING LIKE HE'S COON HUNTING UNDER A KENTUCKY MOON, the
Hound Dog leaps off his table, heads after Drew.




The TWO SHOW OFFICIALS,    sporting nifty sweaters and
manicures, are prepared    to sacrifice their lives to block
the door. In addition     to the PARTICIPANTS trying to get
inside, they're holding    off Roger, Mr. Lo Biancho,
Williamson and Hogan.

                     
             No entry without official
             credentials!

             I'm Emile Lo Biancho! I demand to
             be let in!

             NYPD!   Move aside!
At the mention of POLICE, Roger's EYES GO WIDE. He
slinks down, losing himself in the crowd and sidles off.

                     
             I'll have to see identification,
             officers.
                     
             I'm so sorry, Mr. Lo Biancho. Go
             right in.
AT THE CORNER, Parker and Warren keep their distance, not
wanting to be seen by the Detectives.

             You think she made it?

             She's faster than she looks.





She is -- but now she's not running to catch a policeman,
but to try to keep from being over-taken by...




The ROAR of the CROWD and the BARKING of the PACK
draw the attention of everyone in the Lo Bianchos'
box.

          Isn't that The Emperor, ma'am?

          Good God.   He's mauve.



Drew makes it across the floor and out the other side
into a tunnel...


... appearing in the concession area.


as it breaks off, jumps onto a concession stand and
begins looting it.
Drew makes for the EXIT past the TICKET TAKERS who leap
out of the way and just as she reaches the door and
pushes it open...






Williamson, Hogan, Morty, Bruce, Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho
and quite a few SPECTATORS pour out the doors.







             Please!  I'll get hives!
                     
             Oh, go ahead.


The Detectives appear above her.



She holds up The Emperor.

             I, uh, just wanted to return him.
As the other OWNERS and HANDLERS gather their dogs,
Williamson hands The Emperor off to Mrs. Lo Biancho while
Hogan handcuffs Drew.

             Flog her! Step aside and I'll
             whip her myself!

                     
             Didn't you say it was a man who
             called, Dear?

             So she had an accomplice! We'll
             beat the information out of the
             little wench!
                     (handing him
                      The Emperor)
             Get him cleaned up, Emile.
Williamson and Hogan move Drew toward their car.

             I didn't take her dog, I swear.

             We'll sort it out.






             But I have this interview. I
             mean, it's not really an
             interview. I'd never lie to the
             police...
                     
             ... never mind.
Just as they push her head down into the car, she
glimpses a vaguely familiar face among the myriad GAWKERS
-- it's the Bike Messenger. For just an instant they
lock eyes before the car pulls away.


Parker and Warren round the corner at a run, only in time
to watch the Detective's car leave with Drew in the back
window.

             What now?

             We have to go to the jail and tell
             them what happened.

             What on earth did happen?

             Poor Drew. She wanted to get into
             that program more than anything in
             the world.
With a SIGH, they turn to go and BUMP -- knock into
Bennie, who's staring coldly down at Parker.

             You goin' somewhere?
She's paralyzed with fear.

                     
             Hello, sir.

             Oh my God!   Please don't kill me!

             Kill?






             We don't know anything at all! We
             didn't see anything or hear
             anything and I'll swear to that in
             a court of law!
Bennie appears unmoved. Parker closes her eyes, trying
to meet death with dignity.

             Just not in the face.

             What's the big idea? You two a
             couple a nutbags or somethin'?
She opens one eye.

             Nut bags? No. I mean,    yes. Is
             there a right answer to  that?
             See, my sister had this  interview
             which turned out not to  be an
             interview, really and I  sort of
             messed things up because  I wanted
             to meet him.
Indicating Warren.

             Really?   You came into town just
             for me?   Wow.

             Not now, Warren.
                     
             Drew was going to be late even
             though technically she wasn't
             going to be late since there
             wasn't an interview and that's
             when we got in your car. I
             promise we meant to pay. It was a
             true emergency.

             I meant, why you runnin' when I'm
             trying to give you your bag back?
Bennie hands Parker Drew's daybag.      Parker takes it,
still trying to comprehend.

             You were just...?






             I found your mom's number in the
             book. She said you needed it
             pretty badly for that big
             interview. Listen, I gotta go.
             It's my mother-in-law's birthday
             and I gotta plant some stupid rose
             bush and then take her out to
             dinner at the Pier. See ya
             around.
Bennie waddles over to his Town Car and climbs in.

                     
             Thank you?

             Well, he certainly is a good
             Samaritan.
Parker looks at the daybag.

             You guys lead a pretty interesting
             life, don't you?
But now Parker's mind is elsewhere.     She pulls out Drew's
daybook, opens it.

             We going to the jail, or what?
             I've never been to a jail before.

             What time is it?



FLASH! A MUGS HOT is taken of Drew, looking as
bedraggled, beaten and defeated as humanly possible.




staring at her INK-STAINED FINGERS as Hogan finishes
fingerprinting her other hand.





He hands her a towel to wipe them off. We know that
dirty hands would drive the old Drew crazy. This Drew
merely tosses the towel into the garbage. Who gives a
crap?



Drew sits among other FEMALE CRIMINALS, staring zombie-
like.
An INMATE with freaky frazzled red hair and a whacked out
look in her eye sidles over to Drew.

             I love your outfit.

             Thank you.

             Is it Bobo?

                     (how in the world
                      would this woman
                      know?)
             Yes, as a matter-of-fact, it is.

             He's a genius.
OFF Drew's look of complete spiritual resignation we --




Warren and Parker leap from a cab and hustle across
campus. In only a few strides, Parker's dusting him.

             Try to keep up, Warren!

                     
             Hey! I'm an intellectual! I
             never claimed to be athletic!







             As a matter of fact,  I was excused
             from P.E. because of  an ascended
             testicle!
                     
             Too much information,   right?



Red points at Drew's one shoe.

             Do you mind?   I'm a fanatic for
             Jimmy Choo.

             It's all yours.
She hands the high heel to Red, who enthusiastically
pulls it on and models it.

             MacLeod?
Hogan ENTERS, opens the cell door.

             You're free to go.

             No thanks. I'll just stay here
             with the girls.

             An eyewitness says he saw who took
             the dog. Didn't realize the guy
             was stealing it until he saw us
             grab you.
Hogan takes her by the arm in a fatherly way and leads
her out.




Hogan leads her into the lobby where Bike Messenger Guy
is waiting. He stands up when he sees Drew. Her
dissonance is even more confounded now.






             There's your alibi.

             I don't even know him.

             That's what he said. Go home.
             Get cleaned up, a good night's
             sleep. None of this will seem so
             bad in the morning.
Hogan leaves them alone.       Bike Guy steps over.

             You okay?
As an answer, Drew merely points to herself -- look at
me? Now answer for yourself.

             I'm Jim Wessler.

             Thanks, Jim.    How'd you know?

             Who could forget that face?
Reminded, Drew puts a hand to her face.

             Huh.    No hives.
Suddenly, realizing just how awful she must look, Drew
becomes self-conscious.

             Well... bye.
She walks past him out the door.

             Wait.    Where are you going?

Jim catches up to her.

             Thanks for getting me out of jail
             but I have to go home now because
             my entire life is ruined.






             Bad day, huh?

             You turn understatement into an
             art.

             Can you just tell me your name?
             Please?

                     
             I'm Drew MacLeod. The girl who
             won't be going to the NYU
             Accelerated Program.

             Why not?
Drew looks at her watch.

             Because short of flying, there's
             no way to get from here to NYU in
             five minutes.

             Sure there is.



Parker's on the stairs with Drew's DAYBOOK open, staring
into it like someone who has a final exam in two minutes
but forgot to show up for the semester.
Warren's looking over her shoulder.

             Wow.   And I thought I was anal.

             This is no good. I don't do too
             well with the whole rehearsal
             thing. I'm more of a 'wing it'
             person.
Parker checks herself in her reflection in the glass.
Working herself into Drew form, she puts her hair into a
conservative bun and then tries straightening her posture.






                     
             How's this look? Drewish?

             You know, I've always had a thing
             for librarians.

             Warren, honesty is fine. But you
             could edit a little, you know?

             Got it.

             Wish me luck.

             Good luck, Drew.



about to knock on a door that reads "Professor Que
Spaulding, PhD" when the door suddenly opens and the last
INTERVIEWEE steps out in a suit and tie, confidence
oozing.
Parker nods primly as he passes, then steps inside.



A SECRETARY sits at her computer.        She looks over her
glasses at Parker.

             May I help you?

             I'm here to see Professor
             Spaulding.

             You don't have an appointment.

                     
             Um, no. However...





This is when the inner office door swings open and the
PROFESSOR himself, coat over one arm, briefcase in the
other, steps out.
Parker positions herself directly in front of him,
cutting off his EXIT.

             Professor Spaulding?

             Yes?

             May I have a moment of your time?

             I'm sorry, but I have a plane to
             catch.
He tries to make a move.      Parker blocks him.

             I know. But this is very
             important.

             What is this about?

             Life and death, if you must know.
The Professor hesitates for just an instant, giving
Parker her opening. She grabs his hand, giving it a
vigorous, Young Republican shake.

             I'm Drew MacLeod.

             Ms. MacLeod, I hope this is
             interesting.

             Trust me.


STUDENTS leisurely make their way between classes.

             Yo!    Coming through!





The Students dive out of the way as Jim comes barreling
across campus with Drew clinging for life to his
handlebars.
Just outside the Administration Building, Jim hits the
brakes and Drew FLIES OFF THE HANDLEBARS and like the
puppy in the opening, disappears into a shrub.

             You okay?
The old Drew is back.     She scrambles out of the
shrub...

             Fine.
... and up the stairs -- then stops, turns.

             Wait right there.
                     
             I mean, I don't want to be bossy.
             You don't have to stay right
             there, if you don't want to.

             I'll be right here.

             Great.
She launches herself into the building.


Parker sits genteelly forward in her chair, legs crossed
just so at the ankles, hands folded in her lap.

                      
             I promise you, though my missing
             the deadline seems to suggest
             otherwise, my studies would never
             suffer on account of my being
             unorganized. This was, and I
             think anyone who knows me would
             vouch for this, a complete
             anomaly.







             I was so thrown when my sister
             asked Bernard to the dance that I
             simply failed to post the schedule
             request and seeing it already
             checked off on my to-do list, I
             over-looked it until after the
             deadline had passed.

             Ms. MacLeod, I recall your
             application being one of the
             strongest we received. Not seeing
             your name on the interview list
             surprised me. I assumed, of
             course, that you'd changed your
             mind.

             No. Not at all. This program is
             my number one priority.

             Yes, well, I'm sure you can
             appreciate that with so many
             applicants for so few spaces there
             must be rules to govern the
             selection process.
A FUSS from the OUTER OFFICE interrupts them and suddenly
the door bursts open and Drew BURSTS IN:

             Professor Spaulding? I can't
             apologize enough for barging in
             like this.
The Professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but
by Drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look.

             No. Please. It looks like I'm
             taking the red-eye now anyway.
Drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a
face full of Parker, already there.

             Parker?

                     
             Hi, Parker.






             What are you doing?

                     
             Oh, the Professor and I have had a
             wonderful talk about how important
             this program is to me and how it
             was my sister, Drew, who screwed
             things up.

             I'm having a little trouble
             following this.

             You were... being me?

                     
             Would you like to sit down?
Seeing her plan to help Drew go awry, poor Parker's lip
trembles.

             When I saw them take you to
             jail...

             Jail?

             ... I didn't think you'd make it.
             I knew I wouldn't be any good at
             it, but I figured at least there
             was a chance.

                     
             That's... sweet.

             You're not mad?

             No.

             I'm so sorry for today.






             It's okay.    But let's talk about
             it later.

             Please.    Go right ahead.

             Thank you.

             Parker, consider, just for a
             moment, whether this is the
             appropriate time and place.

             Okay, I considered.     What I want
             to say is, I didn't    purposefully
             set out to ruin your    day, but that
             doesn't mean I'm not    a little...
             jealous.

             Jealous?

             I'm not like you. I don't have
             your intensity, your focus, your...

             Fashion sense?

             I just mean, maybe, even if I
             don't intend to, maybe that
             jealousy, you know, gets in the
             way sometimes.

             You mean subliminally you're
             undermining me?

             I don't know if I'd get that
             technical about it. But yeah.

             Well, thank you for saying that.

             You're welcome.
                     
             Aren't you going to confess now?






             Confess what?

             There's got to be something. Like
             how you lost your shoes?

             How you're secretly jealous of me?

             Why would I be jealous of you?

             Oh, let me see. Because I don't
             have a stick up my butt? Because
             I know how to have fun? Because
             I'm spontaneous and creative and
             men are all my love slaves?
Drew stops, ponders this deeply.

             Nope.
Then she smiles, only a teensy bit.

             Well, maybe about the love slaves.
This is the first moment in a long time when the sisters
share a smile. Drew turns to the Professor.

             Professor, I'm Drew MacLeod.

             Are you certain?

             I wanted more than anything in the
             world to be a part of your
             program. I still do. But I
             failed. I didn't follow the
             rules. And honestly, before
             today, I didn't know how I was
             going to live with that. How to
             live with failure. I'm not good
             at it. I haven't done it much.
             But today I realized that I've
             lived in fear of it too long.







             I hope my application was a strong
             one and I came here today to ask
             your indulgence and to place my
             name back into consideration. If
             you won't, I'll understand.
             Better yet, I'll get over it.
             Maybe I shouldn't be in such a
             hurry after all. Maybe it would
             be best for me to just take
             this...
Drew takes her DAYBOOK from Parker and drops it in the
wastebasket.

             ... and lighten up.
Parker looks horrified at the sight of Drew's daybook in
the trash and fishes it out.

             Thanks for your time. Sorry if
             you missed your plane.
He shakes her hand.

             It was worth it, I assure you.
             Now, could you clear up one thing
             for me?

             Sure.

             What's this about jail?



Warren and Jim sit waiting when the Girls come out,
smiling.
Drew turns to Parker.

             Thanks.
The sisters hug, but we GO...







             Sis?

             Yeah?

             Gotta go.
Parker grabs Warren by the hand and blasts around the
corner just as...
Charley MacLeod pulls up in his truck and parks half on,
half off the curb.
He leans over, waving to Drew.

             Hi, baby!
Drew goes over to the truck.

             I was in the city. I tried to
             call you. Thought you might want
             a ride home.

             Sure.

                     
             Is that a new outfit?

             Yeah.     Hey, one minute, 'kay?

             Sure.
Drew goes back to Jim.

             Thanks.

             You're welcome.

             I, uh...






             You want to maybe... get together?

             First I want to take a shower.
             For about a week.
Drew leans over and kisses him on the cheek.         Then she
reaches into her bag and pulls out a card.

             Call me, okay?

             You have a card? Aren't you in
             high school?
She smiles, shrugs and climbs in her dad's truck. They
pull away, leaving Jim waving. When they're out of
sight, Parker and Warren come back around the corner of
the building.

             Oh, man. I'm doomed.     I'll never
             get home before them.

             Sure you will.
Warren pulls out a CELL PHONE, hits speed dial.

             Dad?   Hey.   I need a favor.


Passing over the City, Warren and Parker are strapped in,
headphones on, and have to talk above the DIN.

             Warren, something tells me you're
             spoiled!

             Yes!   But in a good way!



Both girls are putting on makeup, getting ready to go
out. Everything appears the same as before, Drew's side
neat and clean, Parker's a wreck.






                      
             Girls?
Quinn steps in, grimfaced.

             How naive do you think I am?
The Girls share a look.       Busted.

             We, uh, don't think you're naive,
             Mom.

             No. Honestly, it was all an
             accident.
Quinn holds out her hand revealing a BELLY RING.

             I know what this is.
There's almost a palpable sense of relief between the
girls. They BOTH LOOK DOWN and pull up their shirts --
Parker's not the only one who has her naval pierced --
Drew does, too.

             Parker, I'm disappointed you'd do
             something like this without
             consulting me, but Drew? What got
             into you? Do you know how
             unhygienic those places are?

             It was... spontaneous.

             Yeah. Obviously. Oh, by the
             way...
She holds out her other hand, which has an envelope.

             This came in the mail.
They stare at the envelope -- NYU ADMISSIONS DEPARTMENT.

             So?   Open it.
There's a HONK.






             The guys are here!
Parker and Quinn stare at Drew.

             Come on!

             It doesn't really matter one way
             or the other. Maybe I shouldn't
             be in such a hurry. Why don't we
             go out and have some fun.
             Besides, if this isn't good news,
             I don't want it to ruin our night.
Parker and Quinn simply continue to stare.


INT. MacLEOD LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Charley's laying on the couch with some chips on his
stomach watching the game.
Jim and Warren are watching, too.

             So, how'd you two meet the girls?
Jim and Warren share a look.        This is a story best left
untold.

                     
             A dance/A class.

             Dance class, huh? Stupid    me. I
             figured it had to be that   day in
             New York when Parker blew   off her
             chem test and Drew was in   jail.
Charley smiles.       He's not as out of it as he appears.
Suddenly, all three women SCREAM JOYFULLY O.S.

                        
             Chips?
