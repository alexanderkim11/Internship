	 Cameron Crowe
	 December, 1998











	A close-shot of a yellow legal tablet.  A young hand comes
	into frame, holding a pencil.  For a few moments, we hear only
	the soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written
	in a series of dissolves.  The hand carefully erases and
	corrects an error or two along the way.  And then the sound of
	an old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we
	now hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' "Christmas Song."



	A lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky.  Behind
	it, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of
	San Diego.  A dry, hot Southern California day.  Even the wind
	is lazy, and a little bored.



	Santa Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he
	collects for the Salvation Army.  This is Christmas in the
	Southland.  No snow, no winter wonderland.  Just a pleasantly
	thick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues.

	Turning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35.
	She is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's

	Having with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens.  They
	stand apart from the other shoppers.  All around them is the
	highly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering
	fake Christmas trees.  She hurries her son through the
	commercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual
	conversation, when something stops her.  A Workman is affixing
	letters to a store-front.  He has already placed the MERRY...
	now he's finishing the XMAS.  Elaine is strong, but always
	pleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.


			Excuse me, I'm a teacher.  There is no
			word in The English Language -- "Xmas."
			It's either Happy
			Holidays.

	The Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns
	away.  The Workman shares a look with William, who shrugs -
	that's my Mom.





	This is the new professional-class.  It's a mini-condo
	community.  Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with
	common walls.   Move in on one of these homes, the one without
	Christmas lights.  At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl.
	She checks her cheek, straightens her hair.  She hides
	something under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance
	to enter.  Music fades.



	We now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her
	son, as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets.
	The meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan.  Across the kitchen
	we see William.  He's a great listener, with a calm and curious
	face that takes everything in.


			- so Livia -


			-- killed everyone off so her son
			Tiberius could inherit the throne.
				
			Just like Nixon.

	William nods, intrigued.  He has a good disposition.  The
	world of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings
	out in his Mom.  There is a small clatter at the front door,
	as the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes.
	She silently curses herself.

					ELAINE 
			Anita, is that you?


			Hey Mom!  I already ate.

	Mom moves to the living room to greet William's sister.  William
	peers into the next room.



	She's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches
	her.  We now discover ANITA, 16, up-close.  She is an alluring
	young Natalie Wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile.


			You sure?  I'm making soy cutlets.

	The words "soy cutlets" sends a small shiver through the girl.


			I'm fine.  Already ate.

	William stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as
	Mom moves closer to his sister.  She sees something curious
	about her daughter.


			Wait.  You've been kissing.


				
			No I haven't.


				
			Yes... yes, you have...


			No I haven't.


			Yes you have.  I can tell.


				
			You can't tell.

	Mom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully.
	To her, everything is a quest for knowledge.


, I know who it is.
			It's Darryl.

	Anita is stunned silent.  She turns slightly to look at herself
	in a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself
	immediately.

					ELAINE 
			And what have you got under your coat?

	This is the booty Anita didn't want to give up.  Mom picks at
	the corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket.
	She withdraws the album. It's Simon and Garfunkel's 


				
			It's unfair that we can't listen to
			our music!


				
			Honey, it's all about drugs and
			promiscuous sex.


			Simon and Garfunkel is poetry!


			Yes it's poetry.  It's the poetry of
			drugs and   Look at
			the picture on the cover...



	Mom's fingers at the edges.  We examine the insolent faces on
	Richard Avedon's classic album cover.  Even Simon and Garfunkle
	look guilty under her scholarly inspection.

					ELAINE 
			... honey, they're on 


			First it was butter, then sugar and
			white flour.
				
			Bacon. Eggs, bologna, rock and roll,
			motorcycles.

	Nearby, William squirms as he watches the gently escalating
	conversation.  Anita glances at her brother.  He silently
	urges her to downshift.  She can't.

					ANITA 
			 it was celebrating Christmas on a
			day in September When you knew it
			wouldn't be "commercialized."


			That was an experiment.  But I
			understand -


			What else are you going to ban?


			Honey, you want to rebel against
			knowledge.

					ELAINE 
			I'm trying to give you the Cliff's
			Notes on how to live in this world.


				
			We're like nobody else I know.

	These are the words that sting Mom most.


			I'm a teacher.  Why can't I teach my
			own kids?
				
			


			Darryl says you use knowledge to keep
			me down.  He says I'm a "yes" person
			and you're trying to raise us in a
			"no" environment!


				(immediately, can't help
			it)
			Well, clearly, "no" is a word Darryl
			doesn't hear much.

	Anita gasps.  Ever the peacemaker, William weighs in.  Nearby
	is a poster - "No More War."


			Mom --


			Everything I say is wrong.


Even
			William hates you!


			I don't hate her.


				
			You don't even know the truth!

	William looks vaguely confused.


			Sweetheart, don't be a drama queen.

	Anita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the
	strangled-sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for
	the first time.


  you!  All of you!


			Hey!

	Anita runs down the hall to her room.  Elaine turns to William,
	relating to him more as a fellow parent than a child.

					ELAINE 
			Well, there it is.  Your sister using
			the "f" word.





				
			


				
			Well.  The letter "u"...

	Shot moves in on the kid, as we hear the opening strains of
	The Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin."



	Music continues.  Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking
	male teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror.
	There's the kid with a very mature-looking moustache, the  kid
	proudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some
	), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the
	face of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns... and
	then a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down,
	down to find William.  He is so much younger, without a zit in
	sight.  Puberty is so very distant on his horizon.



	Song continues as we see William's perspective of these much-
	older looking kids.  Girls now are visible, and they are even
	more mature than the boys we've just seen.  They flirt and
	glow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys.
	Whispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down.
	It's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring
	world of older teenagers... and to be so invisible to them.


 in our grade?




				
			Are you really in our grade?

	William turns to see tall, adenoidal TIM TOBIN.  The most mature
	looking kid we've seen yet, he challenges William in a loud
	theatrical tone.  It is a voice right out of 
	which incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just
	starred.  William answers in a respectful voice.  He is
	desperate for acceptance.


			Yeah.


			Hey guys!  Check it out!  William
			doesn't have any !

	Others now begin to gather around, examining William.  He has
	never been more naked.


			How old are you man?


			He's not a man, he's a little baby
			kid.  He Doesn't even get zits yet.


			How come you don't have any hair down
			there?


				
			

	Their voices echo off the tiled walls.  Now everyone is watching
	the hairless William.  He is confused by their meanness.




	All eyes are on him, waiting for a response.  The kid's mental
	wheels turn frantically.  And from somewhere comes an attitude,
	a swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could
	only be a merciful deity.


				
			I had 'em.  

	It is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy.  And it works.
	Guy #2 cracks up, then others.  William's new accuser is
	suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these
	older boys.  Others turn away, on to other things.  Tobin stares
	at William, and then also turns away.



	William jumps into the backseat of the white Ford Country Sedan
	station wagon, carrying books.    Mom continues
	driving William and Anita home from school.


				(cheerfully, by rote, to
			William in back)
			Put on your seatbelt.   I don't want
			you flying through the windshield.

	Anita examines her own un-fastened seatbelt, which Mom hasn't
	noticed.


			We got our annuals today --


				
			"Received" your annual.


				
			I look so much  than everyone
			else.


			Enjoy it while you can.

	Camera drifts from Mom to Anita, who can take it no longer.





				
			Can this wait until we get home?


  Tell him the truth.
			

	Mom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation.


				
			He  how old he is.


			The other kids make fun of him because
			of How young he looks.  Nobody 
			him.

	They call him "The Narc" behind his back...


			They do?


			What's a "Narc?"


			
			





				
			Come on you guys.  It's no big deal.
			I'm 12.  It's okay. She skipped me a
			grade, it's okay.  Big deal.   I'm a
			year younger.  They're 13, I'm 12 --
				
			Aren't I?

	Their silence is eloquent.


				
			I also put you in first grade when you
			were five and never told you.


				
			So...  I'm... how old?

	A heavy quiet.  She and his sister ignore him, as they now
	debate the subject with each other.


			You lied to him!  You make such a big
			deal about the truth and you lied!


				
			He never asked.


			What -- like he's going to ask if he's
			as old as he  he is?  Don't you
			realize, this is going to scar him
			


			Honey... sweetheart... don't be
			Cleopatra.  We have to be his mother
			 his Dad.


			You put too much pressure on him!


				
			How... old...


			And when he rebels in some strange and
			odd way, don't blame me.


			... am I?


				
			I skipped you an extra grade.  You're
			eleven.


			
			

	He looks at his body, the information affects him physically.
	New sounds come from way down deep inside.  Mom now begins
	speed-rapping, trying to stem the leak.  She starts the car.


			So you skipped fifth grade.  There's
			too  much padding In the grades.  I
			taught elementary school.  5th grade -
			unnecessary.  Nothing happens in the
			5th grade.  All Teachers know it, no
			one talks about it.


				
			E - 


			And you skipped kindergarten because I
			taught it to you when you were four.


			(still horrified, looking
			 at his body)
			This explains... so much...


			You've robbed him of an adolescence!


			Adolescence is a marketing tool.


			He's got no "crowd"... no friends...


			Okay!

	Anita reaches out to her brother.  With the compassion of a
	saint, she offers this:


			Honey, I know you were expecting
			puberty.  You're just going to have to
			shine it on for a while.

	Deeply embarrassed, William shrinks down in the seat.  Mom
	monitors his face constantly.  She is raw and sincere... and
	yes, inspiring:


			Who needs a "crowd?"  You're unique.  You're
			two years ahead of everybody.  Take those
			extra years and do what you want.  Go to
			Europe for a year!  Take a look around,
			see what you like!  Follow your dream!
			You'll  be the youngest lawyer in the
			country.  Your own great grandfather
			practiced law until he was 93.  Your dad
			was so proud of you.  He knew you were a
			


			What about me?


				(heartbroken, can't help
			herself)
			You're rebellious and ungrateful of my
			love.


			Well, somebody's gotta be normal around
			here!


				(blinking, still can't
			believe it)
			



	William finishes the last of many candy bars.  A mound of
	wrappers sit just below the mirror.  He examines his face
	hopefully for zits.  Nothing coming.  We begin to hear Simon
	and Garfunkel's "America."



	Anita stands in the living room.   The song continues playing
	on the stereo.


			I want to play you a song that explains
			why I'm leaving, and try to listen.


			We can't talk?  We have to listen to
			rock music?



	William watches sadly.  Anita's good-looking boyfriend DARRYL,
	a dead ringer for young Stephen Stills, loads her suitcases
	into a large turqouise Chevy.  The suitcases are adorned with
	plastic stick-on flowers.    All coolness is leaving William's
	life.  Mom watches nearby, worried and helpless.   (Their house
	is more austere, less "fun" than the other front lawns.)


			Take good care of her in San Francisco,
			man.

	Darryl gives the kid a sub-human look.  He's invisible, too
	young to converse with.


			How can she leave such a loving family?

	Anita turns and heads towards them.  She focuses on William,
	placing her hands on his young shoulders.  Her face is very
	close to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the
	future.


			One day you'll be cool.

	He nods stoically, hopefully.  He is utterly lost.  She leans
	forward and whispers in his ear.

					ANITA 
			Look under your bed.  It'll set you
			free.

	Anita shakes hands with Mom, and exits.  As the car takes off:


			She'll be back.

	In the distance we hear the whoop of her daughter.





			Maybe not soon...

	William watches wistfully.  He moves away from his mother.
	She pulls him closer.  Shot moves in on his slightly fearful
	face.



	Anita looks back at the receding American Gothic-image of her
	mother and brother.  Sister waves to brother.  She feels for
	him.  Music now shifts to The Who's "Sparks."



	William locks the door.  He reaches under his bed.  It's a
	black leatherette travel bag, with tartan design.  He unzips
	the bag -- it's filled with albums.  He flips through the
	amazing, subversive cache of music.  Cream's 
	the seminal Bob Dylan bootleg  the Rolling
	Stones' 
	 The Mother's of
	Invention's We're Only In It For The Money...  Led Zeppelin...
	Crosby, Stills and Nash... and
	The Who's  with a note taped to it.


 with a candle burning
			and you will see your entire future..."

	The heady effect of all these albums registers, as we see him
	lighting a candle.





	A blue school notebook, with ballpoint pen renderings of the
	names of groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, complete with
	carefully drawn thunderbolts.  Also, the name LESTER BANGS.



	William, now 15, sits in class with book, Adventures in
	Journalism.  His hair is shoulder-length.  A dedicated teacher,
	PATRICIA DEEGAN, walks the aisles.  Music continues.



	William presses the food machine button, pulls an orange from
	a vending container.  He still looks younger than most of the
	students... and these days, especially the girls.



	William sits apart from all the others, under a tree.  He reads
	intently, happily, as he eats the orange.  It's a copy of 
	Magazine.  Music continues.



	Camera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and
	fashions of the rock heroes of the day.  Ian Anderson of Jethro
	Tull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute.  Neil Young,
	enigmatic with perfectly patched Levis.  The Southern Rock Royalty
	of The Allman Brothers Band, posing and laughing in front of
	massive stacks of amps.  Marc Bolan of T. Rex, his ringlet-hair
	backlit by stage lights.  David Bowie in skin-tight Japanese one-
	piece attire, onstage with The Spiders From Mars.  Pete Townsend
	of the Who, slashing windmill-style at his guitar.

	Drift down to a by-line - 



	William walks through the parking lot after school.  Everybody
	now congregates around the new arrival of their lives - their
	own cars.  Arms suddenly clap William on the back, friendly
	faces smile strangely, laughing.  He takes a few steps and
	looks up to see... a school official is hurriedly removing
	something from the high-school marquee.



	which reads: WILLIAM MILLER IS TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE 

	All are laughing.  He laughs with them, and turns as his face
	goes slack.  He shrugs, marches on.



	The song we've been listening to is ripped off the turntable by
	a highly-active man in a red promotional t-shirt proclaiming the
	greatness of The Guess Who.  He is a ferocious, lumbering, music-
	driven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the
	very brim.  This is LESTER BANGS, 25, the rarely-seen God of a
	then new art-form -- Rock Journalism.  A Disc-jockey with long-
	long hair watches helplessly.  William views all this through a
	glass window.  He stands on the corner of a downtown side
	street, halfway up a steep incline.  He is the only person on
	the streets this early Saturday morning.  Reveal that he is
	watching a live radio show, audible to us through the small
	p.a. speaker overhead.


			Quite an honor to have the World's
			Greatest Rock Critic... and editor of
			 Magazine, back Home in San Diego
			for a few days -- Lester Bangs.


			What is this hippie station?!  Where's
			Iggy Pop?  Don't you have a copy of
			


			Lester, isn't it a little early for
			this?

	Bangs searches for the album -- vinyl flying everywhere now,
	with no regard for album jackets.


			Found it!!



	William watches intently.  Bangs thuds the needle onto a copy
	of    We're rewarded with a blast of Iggy and the
	Stooges' "Search and Destroy."   A closer shot on William now
	watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside.  Lester does an Iggy
	Pop impression, acting out a story for the d.j. that we cannot
	hear, never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the
	other side of this double-glass window.



	Bangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego
	street.  It's early, the streets are silent.  Bangs is about
	fifteen beer pounds overweight.  His jeans are loose, his
	paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and
	nights spent writing.  In there somewhere is a good-looking
	guy.  His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he
	takes big sweeping steps.


			So you're the one who's been sending
			me those articles from your school
			newspaper -


			I've been doing some stuff for a local
			underground paper, too.


			What are you like the star of your
			school?


			They hate me.


			You'll meet them all again on their
			long journey to the middle.

	The kid nods, they walk.

					BANGS 
			Well, your writing is damn good.  It's
			just a shame you missed out on rock
			and roll.


			I did?


			Oh yeah.  It's over.


			Over?


			Over.  You got here just in time for
			the death rattle, the last gasp, the
			last 


			Well.  At least I'm here for that.

	Bangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head.  It's
	too late for newcomers.  But if the kid's age is an issue, he
	doesn't mention it.  Like a machine-gun:


			What do you type on?


			Smith-Corona Galaxis Deluxe.


			You like the new Lou Reed?


				
			The early stuff.  The new stuff, he's
			trying to be Bowie, he should be
			himself.  I'm not a big Lou man.


			Yeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou, and
			Lou's Doing Bowie, Lou's still doing
			Lou.


				
			 you like Lou.


			Take drugs?


			No.


			Smart kid.  I used to do speed and
			sometimes Nyquil and stay up all night
			writing and writing, like 25 pages of
			dribble about, you know, the Guess
			Who, or Coltrane,  you
			know, with the music blasting...


  The writing part...

	For a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest
	thing happens.  Bangs laughs.  It's an odd and charming laugh,
	the kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden.  It surprised the kid,
	who smiles back.  Bangs stops at the corner, and offers a
	pleasant but very final nod of the head.


			Well, alright.  It's been nice to meet
			you.  I'll see you around.  Keep sending
			me your stuff.


			Okay.  See you.


			I can't stand here all day talking to
			my many fans.



	But neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning.
	They stand for a beat, hands in pockets, on this deserted
	street.  They are alone together, there's nobody else in sight.



	William listens intently as Lester eat a sandwich.  His face
	is an open book filling with words.


			-- so anyway, you're from San Diego
			and   Because once you go
			to L.A., you're gonna have friends
			like crazy but they'll be 
			they're gonna try to  you.  The
			publicists!  The bands!  You got an
			honest face, they're gonna tell you
			  But you CANNOT make friends
			with the rock stars.

	The kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures --
	  Bangs nods.

					BANGS 
			 make friends with the rock stars.
				
			That's what's important.  If you're a rock
			journalist, a true journalist -- first you
			will never get paid much.  But you 
			get free records from the record company.

	The kid's eyes widen.  Bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal
	writing style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate
	softie.

					BANGS 
			And they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet
			girls... they'll try to fly you places for
			free.... offer you drugs...  I know.  It
			sounds great.  But they are not your
			friends.   These are people who want you
			to write sanctimonious stories about the
			genius of the rock stars and they will
			 and strangle everything
			we love about it.

	Privately, William thrills.    It all sounds great to
	him.  He listens to the grouping of the words, every one of
	them.  He madly scribbles.

					BANGS 
			They are trying to 
			for a form that is gloriously and
			righteously -

	The kid leans forward as Lester finds the right word.

					BANGS 
			-   And you're smart enough to
			know that.  And the day it ceases to
			be dumb is the day it ceases to be
			  Right?  And then it will just
			Become an 


			... Industry... of... cool...


  And it's
			happening right now.  I'm telling you,
			you're coming along at a very dangerous
			time for rock and roll.  The war is
			over.  They won.  99% of what passes
			for rock now... SILENCE is much more
			compelling.  It's over.  I think you
			should turn around and go back and
			be... a lawyer or something... but I
			can see from your face that you won't.
			I can pay you thirty-five bucks.  Gimme
			a thousand words on Black Sabbath.


				
			An assignment.


			Yeah.  And you should build your
			reputation on being honest... and
			


				
			Honest... 


			And if you get into a jam -- call me.
			I stay up late.

	Bangs reaches across the table, and William watches as he
	scribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate
	notebook.  The notebook has just become valuable.  They sit
	together, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence.



	Mom drives William to the San Diego Sports Arena.  She looks
	out the window at the adrenalized concert-goers.  She feels
	protective not just of her son, but an entire generation.
	William goes over his questions for Black Sabbath.


			Look at this.  An entire generation of
			Cinderellas and there's no slipper
			coming.

	William looks out the window at the sign: TONIGHT - SOLD OUT -
	BLACK SABBATH with special guest Stillwater.


			You can drop me off here.


			Black.  Sabbath.  Just remember - you
			wanted to be Atticus Finch in To Kill
			a Mockingbird.

	The kid doesn't answer.  He silently goes over his questions.

					ELAINE 
			As long as I know this is just a hobby,
			I'll go along with it.


  That's
			what Lester Bangs said.


				
			I'll be waiting right here at eleven
			'o clock sharp.  If you get lost, use
			the family whistle.

	He unhooks his seatbelt, stuffs his questions into an orange
	canvas shoulder-bag and exits.

	Elaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock-concert
	crowd.  It's a windy night.  Everything about this image
	troubles her.  She fights with herself, and then uses the family
	whistle immediately.  He turns.

					ELAINE 
				
			

	Fifteen concert-goers turn around instinctively, at the sound
	of a Mother, and then identify William as the object of her
	concern.  All around him, we hear:




	He winces, nods and moves forward.  Music echoes from the open
	windows of many other cars.



	The kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel
	backstage arena door.  He rings the buzzer.  The door wheezes
	open to reveal the keeper of the San Diego Sports Arena's
	backstage list.  Famous to all those who attempt to enter,
	this is SCOTTY.  He is a wiry, humorless man for whom
	powerlessness is the theme of his life -- except for those few
	hours he controls the list.  Scotty is only forty but everything
	about him screams that he's an angry sixty.


			Hi.  I'm William Miller and I'm here
			from  Magazine to interview the
			band Black Sabbath.

	Scotty, immediately suspicious, moves to a nearby podium and
	snaps through three clipboard pages.  He moves back to the
	door and grabs the handle.


			Not on the list.

	He shuts the door with finality.  The kid stands silently for
	a moment.  He looks over his shoulder, at two chattering
	Groupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp.  They
	look at him sympathetically, but he turns away.  William rings
	the buzzer again, withdrawing a copy of  from his bag.
	The door opens.


			Sir, I'm a journalist, and here's a
			copy of the magazine.

	The magazine hangs in mid-air.


   Go to the
			top of the ramp with the girls!

	Slam.  William stands there for a moment.  Unsure of what to
	do next, he looks back to the top of the ramp.  Rejected by
	him just moments earlier, the groupies now feign disinterest.
	Bracing himself, William rings again.  The door opens slowly
	this time.  Scotty stands peering at him.


				
			What-happens-after-I-go-to-the-top-of-
			the-ramp with-the-gi -

	Slam.  Lock.



	William inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the
	ramp.  The wind whips.  It's just him, and two Groupies in
	their evening best.  They now pretend to barely notice the
	young journalist who has been banished to stand with them.
	Chattering excitedly, with sophistication far beyond her 17
	years, is ESTRELLA.  She sports long unruly black hair.  Her
	partner hangs in the shadows, adjusting shoes.  Estrella turns
	to the kid with great disinterest.


 with?


				
			Me?  I'm with myself.





			I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
				
			I'm a journalist.  I'm not a... you
			know...

	Estrella stares at him.  Moving into the parking lot light,
	introducing herself, is a luminous girl in a green faux-fur
	trimmed coat.  This is PENNY LANE.  There is an inviting warmth
	and real interest in the way she asks:





				
			Oh... I'm just... not a... you know.


			Not a "what"?


				
			You know.  A "groupie."

	The two girls are deeply insulted by the word.


			Ohhh!


			Sorry, I -


			We.  Are not.  "Groupies."

	Estrella indicates Penny with great reverence.


 man.  Show some
			


			-- sorry.

	Penny steps closer, focusing completely on the kid.  Behind
	her, concert-goers throw a few woo-woos their way.  She seems
	not to hear them.


			"Groupies" sleep with rock stars because
			they want to be near someone famous.
			We are here because of the   We
			are 


			She used to run a school for Band Aids.


 with these
			guys.  We support the 
			the We are here because of the
			music.

	William is nodding like a doll in a dashboard window.
	Listening.


			Marc Bolan broke her heart, man.  It's
			famous.


			It's a long story.  I'm retired now.
			I'm just visiting friends.


 was the one who changed everything.
			 said "no more sex, no more
			exploiting our bodies and hearts... "


			Right.  Right.


"


			Okay.  Well, see, now I get the
			difference.

	Shot drifts off him and picks up, out of the darkness, another
	breathless girl teetering on tall shoes.  She is in the vicinity
	of 16.  Her black hair is cropped short and died red, just
	like the cover of Bowie's   She is POLEXIA, the
	voluptuous one, from Riverside.


				
			It's all happening.  It's all happening.


			Polexia!!   Did you tell Sabbath we
			were going to be here?


			I talked to Dick with Stillwater, I
			talked with Sabbath.  They're all dying
			to see us.   It's all happening.


			This is our journalist friend.
			Journalist Friend, meet Estrella Starr,
			and Polexia Aphrodisia. And you are --


			William.

	Silent beat.  His name lands like a thud.


			Here comes Sabbath!


			Ozzy!!!  Tony!!!  It's us!!

	A long black limo with darkened windows swishes past, beeps
	twice.  The metal backstage gate rises and the limo rolls
	inside.  And then silence again.  The girls do not discuss
	being rebuffed.

					ESTRELLA 
			I think I saw Sapphire in there.


				
			Okay.  I was with Ian Hunter 
			at Rodney's Last night.  Wanna see his
			spoo?  I saved it in a baggie.

	She opens her purse and shows the girls something inside.
	William edges away.


				
			I'm really happy he's doing so well.


				
			Yeah.  I know he's such a talented
			guy.  I mean, look at him.  Who deserves
			it more?


				
			Nobody -- he's so sweet.


				
			Don't you just  you know.
			To go  between
			good and great?


			Wait.  That's not his.  I would know
			his.

	A very odd look on his face, William now cranes for a discreet
	look.  



	Out steps SAPPHIRE, 19, a tall girl with taller platforms.  Heavy
	eye-makeup.  Her accent is Texan, with odd traces of English.
	In one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne.  In the other,
	a fistful of backstage passes.



				
			

	The girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire.
	Penny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm hooked
	around his.  He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the
	ramp.  Sapphire slaps passes on the girls.  As Scotty (The
	Keeper  of the Backstage List) watches, Penny now slips William
	forward for a pass.


			Oh no.  Not this one --


				
			Who brought 

	The kid looks over his shoulder.  Who's 


			He's with us.


				
			He wasn't with you.


				
			Are you going to turn this into a
			


			All of you can wait outside!  Top of
			the ramp!


			I don't want to cause a Thing.  I'll
			wait.


				
			I'll go take care of this.

	Sadly, they leave him behind.  The thundering arena sound of
	the collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting Yes'
	"Roundabout"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases...
	the glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants
	to be a part of is on the other side of this door.  And then
	it shuts.  He stands alone.

	At the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads.  It reads --
	STILLWATER TOUR 73.  Moving loudly out of the bus is the opening
	band.  This is Stillwater.  Four road-weary band members, and
	their road manager.  Voices booming.

	RUSSELL HAMMOND, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his
	guitar-case.  It's obvious from moment one.  This is the star
	of the band, the charismatic one.  He's tired.  They're late.
	William recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches.
	The buzzer goes unanswered.  The kid is invisible to him, as
	the others now arrive behind Russell.

	Tour/band manager DICK ROSWELL, 27, follows, loudly banging on
	the steel door.  He has the flaxen-haired look of a former
	hippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest
	silver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes.
	His direction is always - forward.


			Let us in, we're Stillwater!  We're on
			the show!!

	William is surrounded by them now.  They stand together under the
	single lightbulb, familiar faces, a live-action album cover.  JEFF
	BEBE the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his
	head.  ED VALLENCOURT the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging
	limply at his sides.  His is a face made for the background. LARRY
	TURNER the compact bass-player.   Dick now kicks at the door with
	his foot, as William produces a copy of  Magazine.


				
			Hi, I'm a journalist.  I write for 
			Magazine.

	Once again, the magazine hangs there.  He can't  it away.


			The enemy!  A rock writer!


				
			I'd like to interview you or someone
			from the band.


				
			I'm sorry but could you please fuck
			off?

	William blinks a little, takes it in stride.  Russell sizes
	him up, moving in the background.


			Okay.  Okay.  I could do that.


 listened to our records.
			You're all just frustrated musicians.
			Do you know what your magazine SAID
			about us?  What was it - "the singer's
			incessant cater walling distracts From
			an assault with no clear purpose."


				
			That was 


			Yeah.  Okay.  Fuck off anyway.  We
			play for fans, not critics.

	Stung, William shrugs.  It's been a terrible night, but at
	least thrillingly so.


			Russell.  Jeff.  Ed.   Larry.
				
			I really love your band.   I think the
			song "Fever Dog" is a big step forward
			for you guys.  I think you guys
			producing it yourselves, instead of
			Glyn Johns, was the right thing to do.
			And the guitar sound was 
				
			Way to go.

	He turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp.
	Russell looks at the others.  That kind of love is hard to
	give up.


				
			Well don't stop 


			Yeah, come back here!!  Keep going!

	They wave him back, as the backstage door opens again.  The
	kid moves back down the ramp.   They herd him in with them,
	through the door.  Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares
	off.

	Russell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him
	forward.


			Not this one.


			He's with us.



			He's not on the He's not coming
			in.  And this is my arena.  And
			furthermore -

	Russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to
	Scotty.

					SCOTTY 
			- have a good time tonight.   Welcome
			to San Diego.



	The band moves quickly down the hallway, with William moving
	to keep up.  A young and grizzled red-haired roadie, RED DOG,
	catches them on the way.  The band swarms around him.


			Red Dog!


			We're playing here tomorrow night.


				
			This is Red Dog, the Allman Brothers
			Band's number one roadie.

	Russel clamps an arm around Red Dog's neck.


			How're the guys?


			Havin a ball, man.  When we have a
			party, we have an 
			party.  Everybody boogies.  Everybody
			gets off.  It's family, man.  We all got
			These now.
				(flashes new mushroom tattoo
			on forearm)
			We'll see you guys in Boston, right?
				
			Dicky and Gregg send you their love.

	Camera catches flash of envy on the face of Jeff Bebe, as
	Stillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room.



	Dressing room activity swirls around him, as William simply
	listens.  He holds a small microphone.  His stoic look gives away
	little of the full body rush he's experiencing.  As the other
	band members drift across frame, Russell Hammond, a true rock and
	roll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready
	for the show.  To the kid, every word is reckless gem.


 because rock and
			roll is a LIFESTYLE...  and a way of
			thinking and it's not about money and
			"popularity!"


 money would be nice.

	Jeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm, and rubs it into
	his scalp - poor man's mousse.


here I
			am... and FUCK YOU if you can't
			understand me.

	Russell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth
	from his guitar case.  The kid notices all these close-up
	details of rock.

					RUSSELL 
			And one of those people is gonna save the
			world and that means that ROCK AND ROLL
			CAN SAVE THE WORLD -- all of us together.

	The kid's eyes dance.  He checks to make sure he's getting the
	recording.  He listens intently.


			And the chicks are great.


			But we didn't do it for that!  We are
			here because we needed to fuckin be
			here, not just 'cause we needed to
			away from Troy, Michigan, WHICH WE
			DID... but what it all comes down to
			is that  The Indefinable Thing,
			when people catch something from your
			music, the thing you put into it.  I'm
			talking about... what am I talking
			about?


				
			The buzz?


			THE BUZZ!   And the chicks, the
			whatever, is an off-shoot of THE BUZZ.
			And like -- you saying you liked "Fever
			Dog?"   That is the fucking buzz, man.
			All we get are these fucking old-ass
			interviewers who don't understand,
			don't LISTEN, don't appreciate why we
			are here, which is the fuckin' BUZZ.

	William nods, holds his microphone steady.  Russell tunes his
	guitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks.
	Jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer.


			The next album will be even better.
			More texture.


			But... it's not what you put in, is
			it?  It's what you leave out.  Listen
			to... listen to Marvin Gaye...

	Russell's face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of
	music.

					RUSSELL 
			A song like "What's Going On."  That
			single "woo" at the end of the second
			verse - you know that woo - that single
			"woo."


				
			I know that, "woo."


				
			That's what you remember.  The silly
			things, the little things... there's
			only one, and it makes the song.  It's
			what you leave out.  That's rock and
			roll.

	William nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed.
	Activity surrounds him.


				
			We used to talk more about this stuff.


			Okay.  See, this is maybe the most
			honest we've ever been in an interview
			because   You're
			the first press guy we've made friends
			with.  We don't normally talk like
			this to them.  And you're supposed to
			be The Enemy!  What are you - 18?


			Yeah.


			There you go.  Still young enough to
			be honest.


				
			Ten minutes 'till showtime, anyone who
			isn't in the band -- 

	Russell takes a last swig of beer.  A roadie whisks his guitar
	away.

					DICK 
			All this luggage is going to L.A.!

	William is swept out in the chaos of the pre-show ritual,
	past the pile of luggage by the door.  It's a colorful heap of
	suitcases, featuring colorful laminated band tags, each with a
	number.



	William sits on the backstage steps, writing feverishly in his
	notebook.  Behind him, two steps higher, Penny Lane scoots
	into place.


			I found you a pass.


				
			Thanks.  I got in with Stillwater.
				
			The guitarist, Russel Hammond, he
			just thoroughly opened up.  He is by
			far the best and most honest interview
			I've ever done.
				
			I've only done  but you know.
			He's 


			You're learning.  They're much more
			fun on the way up.

	William nods, still scribbling.  She eases down into place on
	the step next to him.  Her proximity cause him to look at
	her, his eyebrows rising.  She smooths them down with two single
	fingers.

					PENNY LANE 
			How old are you?


			Eighteen.


			Me too.
				
			How old are we really?


			Seventeen.


			Me too.


			Actually I'm 16.


  The truth
			just  Different.


				
			I'm 15.


			You want to know how old I really am?


				
			No.

	She looks upstairs, soaking in the sound of another band tuning
	up.  Music is her religion.

					WILLIAM 
			How did you get started in all this?


			It's a long story.


				
			Right.  Right.


			We live in the same city.  We should
			be friends.

	She takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his
	thigh - the cooler location.  Nearby, the dressing room door
	opens, and the Stillwater exits.   Excitement level rises as
	they mass in the hallway with instruments.  We hear the amped
	voice of Russell growing nearer.


			The Enemy!

	He approaches, as William stands.  Penny watches, hanging out
	of Russell's eyesight.

	Standing in the supercharged hallway, the kid is anxious to
	introduce his new friends.


			Russell, this is Penny Lane.


				
			Pleasure.


			Penny Lane?  Like the song, right?


			Have we met?



	And do not let go, for too long.  There is history in their
	shake.  Their eyes tell all.  Shot takes us to William, who
	puts two and two together.  It isn't hard.  They clearly know
	each other. Well.


			Well, I guess you've... you've met.


			Penny Lane!  God's gift to rock and
			roll!!  You're back!
				
			Marc Bolan.  

	Other band members pass, adjusting clothes for show time,
	waiting in the hallway... and now singing the Beatles song
	"Penny Lane."


			Come on, let's go.
				
			Both of you.



	House lights go down.  Cheers rise.  Dick's flashlight dances
	on the ground just in front of them, guiding their way in the
	dark to the stage steps.


			- get in the huddle.

	Russell pulls William into the band's huddle.



	Their band ritual, psyching together, arms on each other's
	shoulders in a circle.  They sing a dew lines of the classic
	"Train Kept A-Rollin'" (or "Go See Cal" from the Cal Worthington
	ad) They all touch feet, and then  heading for the stage.
	Russell directs Penny to his side of the stage.  The kid follows.
	Plugging in, still in darkness, Russell hits a practice chord --
	  He steps on effects pedal.  Applause.  (Adlib onstage
	private patter, between members, goading each other -- the stuff
	no audience ever hears)  Twenty feet away, Dick prepares to
	address the crowd from the darkened stage.  It is his favorite
	moment of the evening, the highlight of his job.


			From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome --
				
			

	Light hits the stage, and the band launches into their opening
	song, "If You Say Nothing."  Audience response is strong.
	Shot lingers on the face of William as he soaks in the most
	undeniably exciting moment of any concert, the first thirty
	seconds.

	Jeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some
	vocal pyrotechnics.  Russell looks over to Penny and William,
	at stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an
	elegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he
	belongs... before seriously stepping forward for the first
	guitar lead of the night.  The kid looks over to see Penny
	watching Russell.



	Cases are shut and rolled toward the trucks.  Stillwater heads
	for their bus.  Jeff the singer says goodbye to Estrella Starr,
	like a sailor leaving port.   Russell lingers behind, saying
	goodbye to William, loading his own equipment.  Black Sabbath
	passes with entourage, heading to the stage.


				
			So.  You want to come up to L.A., we'll
			be at the "Riot House" all week.


			"The Riot House?"


			The Continental Hyatt House!  It's on
			Sunset Strip.


				
			Right.  Right.

	All the while, just over the kid's shoulder, Russell scans the
	backstage crowd of hangers-on.  Looking perhaps for Penny Lane.


			Let's blow this burg!


				
			Well tell your friend Miss Penny Lane
			to   Tell her "It ain't
			California without her.  We want her
			around like last summer."   Say it
			like that.


			Got it.


				
			Oh, I'm under the name - 


				
			The Enemy!!  Yeah!!    Come to L.A.,
			we'll take some more.

	Russell joins Jeff, exiting and laughing.  A good show is still
	in the air.


			Later Jeff!  See you, Dick.  Larry.
			Ed.
				
			Mick, Gregg, Red Dog, Scully, Frosty,
			Estrella, 


	  Laterrrr!			 We'll see you down the
						line.

	William is deliriously happy, hands upraised.  He turns to see
	Penny.





				
			Hey.  Hey.  Be cool.


			You just missed Russell!  He says he's
			at the "Riot House" all week and to call
			him.  He's under the name 
			Do you know about the "Riot House?"


			I think I've heard of it.


			He had a message for you!  He said,
			"It's not California without you.  We
			want you around like last summer."
				
			Actually he said "ain't."  "It 
			California - "


			I get the gist.


			How well do you guys know each other?

	She smiles privately.

					WILLIAM 
			I got it.  No problem.  Long story.
			Alright!  I gotta go.

	Elsewhere in the arena, Black Sabbath is performing "Sweet
	Leaf."  The kid could care less.  He has bonded with Stillwater.
	He heads for the door.  Penny walks with him.  He's loving it.
	They pass a still-scowling Scotty, flashing passes, as they
	exit out into the ramp area.



	Penny takes out an eyeliner pencil, writes her number on the
	back of his green notebook.


			Call me if you need a rescue.  We live
			in the same city.


			I think I live in a different world.

	They stand in the night air.  The parking lot is largely silent
	now, save for the thudding bass sounds of Black Sabbath.  In
	the distance, we hear Elaine's insistent whistle.


			Speaking of the world.  I've made a
			decision.
				
			I'm going to live in Morocco for one
			year. I need a new crowd.

	He nods.  He is a rapt audience for this flashy girl.

					PENNY 
			Do you want to come?


			Yes.

	In the distance, we hear the family whistle growing louder.


			It's a plan.  You've got to call me.


			Okay.


			It's all happening.


			It's all happening.

	He nods cooly.  He waits until she turns, and the sprints
	through the parking lot, to the distant family whistle.







	William's fingers work the clunky keys, pressing rewind.  We
	hear a snippet of the intense and lively Stillwater interview,
	full of overlapping and barely discernible voices.
	Meticulously, he untangles the voices, especially Russell's,
	as he transcribes.



	The work of a journalist, as William sits at his Smith-Corona
	Galaxis.  There is a knock at the window, and William scoots
	back in his chair to see a familiar face.  It is Darryl, his
	sister's old boyfriend.  William opens the window.


			Hey Darryl.


			Hey.

	Darryl climbs in the window, looks around the room that was
	once the site of his previous glory.

					DARRYL 
			So she's a stewardess now.


			Yeah.  She and Mom are still sorta...
			I'd say "not speaking," but I don't
			know if they ever did.


			Your sister.  A stewardess.
				
			The things your sister and I did inside
			these four walls...


			That's okay.  I don't want to know.
			It's my room now.


			We flew the friendly skies -





			I don't want to put you in the middle
			of anything.  We don't have to talk
			about it.


			No.


			You seem cooler.


			Yeah.  I'm thinking about going to
			Morocco.


			Lemme know if you need a little help
			with your Mom.


			A little might not be enough.


			She still freaks me out.


				
			Yeah -


			She's famous.


			Listen -


			Go ahead and do what you were doing.
			I just wanna hang in here for a moment.


			Cool.  Alright.

	William nods and continues his work, self-consciously, as Darryl
	sits on his bed and soaks in the memories of the room.  A long
	moment passes.  Darryl pats his thighs, and rises.


			Okay, man.


			Okay, man.



	William slips on corduroy jacket, over a tie-dyed shirt.  Well,
	it's definitely a look.  Mom appears more nervous than her
	son.


			I worry about the drunk drivers.


			Mom.  I'm 15.
				
			Right?


			Yes, you're 15. "And here's that money
			I owed you."

	She reaches in a small box near the door, gives him twenty
	bucks.  It's their routine.

					ELAINE 
			Your dad's favorite joke.  I don't do
			it as well.


			I thought it was pretty good.


			Keep the small bills on the outside.
			And call me if  gets drunk.


			I will call you if anyone
			 gets drunk.


			Good.


				(anticipating her, like a
			parent)
			And don't take drugs.


				
			Ha ha.  Very funny.  See -- sense of
			humor.  Have fun at the dance.  I'm
			glad you're making friends.

	They move to the door, and he steadies her, as if to remind
	her   He opens the door.  She's a wreck, and
	she knows it.


			Mom?


			Yeah -


				(loving but firm, as if to
			a dog.)
			Stay.


			Oh... okay.


			I-love-you-bye.

	He opens the door.  Neil Young.  "Sugar Mountain."  Watching
	him leave is always a killer.  She's not getting any better at
	it either.  She folds her arms tightly across her chest.



	Penny waist by her car, down the hill, sporting a different
	more elegant look.  She cups her hands and yells up to him.
	He hikes down the hill, squishing down the water plants, almost
	falling, the first time we've seen him happy in his own skin.



	Miss Penny Lane's yellow Vega makes the big swing onto Sunset
	Boulevard.  She sings along to the obscure words of Led
	Zeppelin's "Dancing Days."  William takes it all in from the
	passenger seat.  Huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or
	beer, but   It's a wondrous piece of geography for any
	rock fan.  Shot moves in as William, watches, takes it  in.
	He moves his head outside the window to see fully.  Her
	windshield is cracked along the side.


			The Continental Hyatt House.  Also known
			as The Riot House.
				
			Every band stays here, all the ones
			that matter.  The Who.  Zeppelin.
			Alice.  Bowie.  English bands.  American
			bands.  We all know each other.  Twenty-
			four hour room service.  Like us, they
			were outsiders.  They were so 
			they're  and insiders never
			even knew it, because they're 
			and they are inside a place 
			will never be.  And why are we even
			talking about it?  If you're really an
			insider, you're never gonna say it.
			You know what I mean?


				
			Yeah.  

	She makes a swift turn into a secret parking spot near the
	hotel.


 gonna hang out with
			Russell.  You can, but not me.


			What is it with you and Russell?



	Neil Young and Crazy Horse's "Cinnamon Girl" ricochets across
	the Strip.  It's blasting from cars tuned into KMET.  Penny
	now wears her green faux-fur trimmed coat.  She grabs William's
	hand, steadying her hat at the same time.  They dart across
	the busy street.  She stumbles a little on her platforms.  He
	steadies his taller date.  They are a good team as they pass
	one of several humming tour busses parked out front.



	Penny blasts into the Continental Hyatt House, William on her
	arm.  The lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive
	than most clubs.  It's a swirling mass of Roadies carrying
	Halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling
	Rockers, and more than a few Groupies with lower-ambitions and
	taller-platforms than Penny Lane.  The feeling is communal,
	illicit, intoxicating.  The secret community of rock.  Penny
	attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades.


			It's all happening.
				
			And I'm about to use you as protection.


			Penny Lane!!


				
			These guys are with Alice Cooper.  I'm
			going to pretend I don't know them.


			Penny!!  Does Alice know you're here?


			I'm just showing my very dear, very
			wonderful friend around.  He's a very
			important writer - he knows Lester
			Bangs.
				
			I'm responsible for his moral conduct
			while he's abroad.


				
			Penny Lane!!   God's gift to rock and
			roll!!


			I'm retired.
				
			And don't argue with me!





				
			Have we met?

	Effortlessly touching an arm here and there, charming all -
	she had four men suddenly circling her.

					PENNY LANE 
			I've made a decision.  I'm going to go
			traveling in India.  Then I'm going to
			learn how to play the   Then
			I'm going to go to college for one
			year.

	William looks at her, perplexed and a little hurt.  What about
	Morocco?


				
			There's nothing they could teach you
			in college, darling.
				
			Call Alice.  He's under the name Bob
			Hope.


			I heard you were with Russell from
			Stillwater.


  I throw the little ones back.

	Lusty laughs circle William.  Overlapping this dialogue is the
	appearance of our friend Polexia.


				(in tears, in pieces,
			emotional)
			Ian Hunter is a 


			Polexia!


			Opie!!!

	She hugs him like a long-lost friend, knocking the air out of
	him.  And now overlapping this action, appears Superfan RIC
	NUNEZ, 14.  His eyes are forever moist, but he's oddly formal
	and never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes.  Tonight he
	wears a custom homemade t-shirt with iron-on block letters.
	It features the four Led Zeppelin symbols and the words: "TO
	BE A ROCK AND NOT TO ROLL."  A felt-tip pen is still in his
	quivering hand.  Nunez walks with them, backpedaling as he says:


			It's all happening.   I just saw them
			on the seventh floor!  Mr. Jimmy Page...
			Mr. John Paul Jones...
				
			Mr. Robert Plant signed my shirt in
			the elevator!!  Five minutes ago, he
			touched this pen.  Please don't smear
			it.  And Bonzo's gotta new motorcycle
			in the hotel!


			Ric is a Zeppelin fan.


			Yeah, I picked that up.


			He tours with them, but not "with"
			them.


			They're on the 12th floor, but there's
			guards there!  So you gotta go to the
			tenth floor and go up the back steps.


			This is my very dear, very close, very
			 friend William Miller, he is
			 with Lester Bangs.


			It's all happening!!  See you in
			Cleveland!

	Ric rushes back to the elevators.


			I'm retired!  Doesn't anybody believe
			me!?



	Penny nearby as William picks up the house phone.  He shouts
	over the din.


			Harry Houdini, please.

	As he waits, he discreetly pockets the matches, hotel pad and
	pencil next to the housephone.



	William, Polexia and an ambivalent Penny walk the hallway,
	looking for the room.  William looks in the passing open doors,
	each one a different window into another world.


			Okay.  Time to put on the lampshade.

	Up ahead, the door to their smallish hotel room is open.
	Inside, a band party in full swing.  A clunky early-model boom
	box segues from James Brown's "Make It Funky" to Led Zeppelin's
	"Gallows Pole."   Russell Hammond is the center of this party,
	jabbing out the chords, playing along on guitar.  Much singing
	echoes all around.  It's a hotel-room Hootenanny, and all
	members of the band are present.  Penny Lane takes a breath
	and enters, with arms extended and pointing in opposite
	directions.  She does a flawless stewardess imitation, with
	proper hand gestures, to a loud party ovation.

					PENNY LANE 
			"Ladies and Gentlemen.  Please
			extinguish all smoking materials and
			notice that the captain has turned on
			The No Smoking sign.  Your seat and
			tray tables should be locked in their
			full and upright positions."




	She is instantly and overwhelmingly, the life of this party.
	Russell joins William.


				
			Alright.


				
			Alright.

	Russell places a beer in William's hands, and exits.


				
			"In the unlikely event of a water
			landing, the seat below you will serve
			as a -"
				
			Oh, the hell with it.

	They all applaud her, laughing.  William watches her with
	wonder, as she turns his way and winks.  Jeff approaches the
	alluring Polexia, and goes to get her a beer.  Meanwhile,
	Polexia sidles up to William.  She sees him watching Penny at
	the other side of the room.


				
			Act One, in which  pretends she
			doesn't care about him.

	POV shot travels to Russell, strumming the guitar that is always
	a part of his body.  Russell is watching Penny Lane
	surreptitiously.

					POLEXIA 
			Act Two, in which  pretends he doesn't
			care... and goes right for her.

	Russell moves towards Penny.

					POLEXIA 
			Act Three, in which it all plays out
			the way she planned it.  She'll eat
			him alive.


				
			We've got to stop them.


			Stop them?  You were her excuse for
			coming here.




			I need ice!

	Penny disappears out the door, across the hallway.  Russell
	follows a moment later.  The kid's eyebrows rise.  Polexia
	regards the kid with affection, adjusting his collar and peeling
	a hair off his jacket.


			I just worry about people using her.
			You know?  'Cause she brings out the
			good side in everybody else, but what
			do they do for   Life kills me.
			Do you have any pot?


			Not on me.


			Do you smoke?


			No.
				
			But I... I grow it.  I grow it.

	Polexia looks at the kid, laughing at his poor job of lying.


			You're funny.  You know, if you were
			only taller, English, rich, a guitar-
			player and older...


			I'd be someone else.


			Yeah.  Good point.

	Jeff appears with her beer, and she whispers in the kid's ear
	before she exits with Jeff Bebe.

					POLEXIA 
			Bless me father for I may sin tonight.

	The kid watches, as the boom box plays an obscure favorite of
	Russell's, Eddie Giles' "Losin' Boy."  There is the sound of a
	motorcycle somewhere down the hallway.



	The ice machine makes new cubes with a grinding noise.  Penny
	puts ice in her glass.  Behind her, Russell moves into frame,
	hands delicately riding the sides of her body.  A motorcycle
	roars by, just outside the door, as Penny moves away from
	Russell's exploring hands.


				
			How does it end?


			What?


			You know - the story about the girl
			who dumps the guy who has an ex-ex
			wife -- the one we don't talk about --
			and gets a hundred... okay, five letters
			from him, and then doesn't even leave
			a pass in San Diego.  Wake up!  I'm
			retired and I never believed you anyway.
			You're too talented and too good-looking
			to be trusted and everybody knows it.


				
			You're retired like Frank Sinatra is
			retired.

	She makes a scoffing noise.  He moves to the ice machine, with
	a glass of his own.

					RUSSELL 
			Miss Penny Lane.  Let me tell you what
			rock and Roll will miss the day you
			truly retire.

	He tosses cubes in his glass, one by one.  After the first cube:

					RUSSELL 
			The way you turn a hotel room into a
			home.
				
			The way you pick up strays wherever
			you go.  Like Pied Piper.
				
			The way you know the words to every
			song.   song.  Especially the bad
			ones.   the bad ones.
				
			That green coat in the middle of summer.
				
			The real name you won't reveal.
				
			And.  I'd keep going, but my glass if
			full.


				
			

	He kisses her powerfully, hands at his sides.  She fights to
	keep her hands off him.  Bonham's motorcycle rips by, just
	outside the door.


			Come to Arizona.


			Never.


			We leave Thursday morning.  9 AM.  And
			pack light this time.  

	They kiss.  The motorcycle speeds by again, just outside.



	The hallways are crowded, as William looks at the closed door
	of the ice room.  He leans against the wall, alone now.  Trying
	to look like he belongs.  Behind him, most of the band has
	disappeared into other rooms, leaving only hangers-on in their
	places.



	Music.  We pan across cubicles bustling with laid-back fervor.
	These are the San Francisco-based main offices of 
	Magazine.  We have arrived for the waning days that this
	magazine could still be called, with a straight-face, an
	"underground" publication.  Their mounting success crowds the
	edges of every frame.  Camera catches the Annie Leibowitz
	portraits that hang on the walls -- Lennon, Jagger, Rod Stewart,
	James Taylor.

	We find editor BEN FONG-TORRES, 29,  in his cramped cubicle.
	Sitting nearby is curly-haired and mustachioed Star Staff
	writer, DAVID FELTON, 32, who smokes his cigarettes with a long
	holder.  Felton reads one of William's articles, chuckling.


			William Miller?





	William is on the phone in his own small room.


			This is he.


			Crazy.  William, this is Ben Fong-
			Torres.  I'm the music editor at Rolling
			Stone Magazine.  We've got a copy of
			your stories from the San Diego Door.
			This is the same William Miller?

	William instantly, nervously alters his voice to sound older.


			Yes it is.


				
			Voice of God, howling dogs, the spirit
			of rock And roll... this is good solid
			stuff.


				(immediately, suddenly
			deeper)
			Thanks... thanks.


			You should be writing for us.  Any
			ideas?


				
			How about Stillwater?


			Crazy.  New album... their third...
			starting to do something.

	Ben shuffles through papers, looking for a tour itinerary on
	his promotional-material laden-desk, automatically plotting
	the piece aloud.

					BEN 
				
			Stillwater.  Hard-working band makes
			good.  Get 'em to respond to the critics
			who dismissed the first two albums as
			workmanlike. Guitarist is the clear star
			of the band.    Let's do three-
			thousand words.  You'll catch up to them
			on the road.  We'll set up billing --
			don't let the band pay for anything.


				
			Sounds good.


			We can only pay -- lemme see, three-
			thousand words -- 

	The kid's eyes widen.

					BEN 
			Alright, a grand.   What's your
			background?  You a journalism major?


				
			Yes.


			What college --



	Elaine now gets on the extension.


			Honey, I need you to do that thing
			that fixes the garbage disposal --

	She hangs up.



	The kid is paralyzed.


 lady gets when I
			don't Snap to it -


			Crazy.


			Crazy!  I'll let you go.  Call me at
			the San Francisco office tomorrow.



	The great Lester Bangs stands in the promotional album-clogged
	bedroom of his Birmingham, Michigan, home/office at 
	Magazine.  There is nothing in frame that does not deal with
	music.  In the background, a scratchy and chaotic Coltrane
	record.


 Magazine.  They
			will change your story, they'll re-
			write it and turn it into swill.
			Beware!!


			But besides that, what would be wrong
			with it?


				
			You have starry eyes, my friend.
				
			Look.  Do the story.  It's a good break
			for ya.  But remember this --

	The kid listens intently, and makes notes.

					LESTER BANGS 
			... don't do it to make friends with
			people who are trying to use you to
			further the big business desire to
			glorify worthless rock stars like
			Stillwater.  And don't let those swill
			merchants re-write you.


				
			... swill merchants...


  What are you listening to?



	William knocks on the teacher's lounge door.  A Teacher answers,
	protective of their sanctuary.


				
			I need to talk to Mrs. Deegan, from
			Journalism.

	Mrs. Deegan appears in the doorway.



	The sun is still shining.  It's late afternoon, as Elaine Miller
	exits her car and arrives home.  She sees a few extra cars in
	the driveway, is immediately suspicious.



	Elaine arrives to find William, Mrs. Deegan and Darryl awaiting
	her in the living room.  It's a 1973-style intervention.  They
	wear sunny, compassionate smiles.


			Whatever it is, the answer is no.


			Elaine, we need to talk to you.
			  I am a teacher.
			You're a teacher.  We speak the same
			language.

	Mom sits down.  She is fully engaged and worried, her natural
	state.

					MRS. DEEGAN 
			Now I'm not a jump-up-and-down person,
			but something  has happened to
			William.  And you have every reason to
			be happy...
				
			... and calm.

	Carefully gauging Elaine's face, the teacher continues.

					MRS. DEEGAN 
			William has been gifted with a shining
			opportunity in the world of journalism.
			Through a love of music, and at an
			oddly-young age, he has received a major
			assignment from a national publication
			called  Magazine.

	Mrs. Deegan produces a copy, and places it on Elaine's lap.
	It sits there like the plague.

					MRS. DEEGAN 
			Now you are rather famously not a fan
			of rock music, but such are the ironies
			of life, that happens to be the very
			topic of William's assignment -
				
			- rock music.  A band.


				
			Honey, what are  doing here?


			Moral support.

	Mom looks evenly at her son, seated opposite her in this small
	living room.


			What's involved?


			Well.  It's a great opportunity.  He'll
			be well-paid, and published nationally --
				
			-- and he'll go on tour with a rock
			band for four days.  No small planes...
			he travels on a bus.


			Is it time for me to say something?


			Sure.





			And in anticipation of that response -


			No.


			-- William has prepared --


				
			"Lo, that which I have feared has come
			upon me."


				
			"He who jealously guards his fears,
			quietly yearns to bring them about!"

	Mrs. Deegan admires their high-strung intellectual parrying,
	makes an impressed noise.


				
			  I have raised him to be an honor
			student, which he is.  We have agreed
			on all our goals.  We raised him to be
			a lawyer, we moved here to be near the
			finest law school in the West.  Plus,
			he has finals coming up, and in one
			week he graduates with 



			He's got no friends!!


			Darryl.  Please.

	Nearby, having anticipated all of the above, William nods to
	Mrs. Deegan, and stands.


			Elaine, may I present to you... your
			own son.

	William takes a lawyerly stroll, turns to face his mom.



				
			I wish to disprove the prevailing false
			belief that rock music is based on drugs
			and sex.  True, perhaps at one time...
			but rock music is different now.  It is
			 performed by hard-working
			intellectuals, with... with blazing
			intellectual pursuits, and I am going to
			play for you a piece of music designed
			to show you that my thesis is correct.


			This is going to be hell.

	Across the room, Darryl takes his position near the stereo.


			The song is based on the literature of
			Tolkien...  and it's mystical attempt
			to elevate humanity has been successful
			throughout the world...  
			will change your life.

	Mom stifles a cough.  William nods to Darryl, who reverentially
	drops the needle with a thud.  Mom is trapped, as we listen to
	silent static... and then... the opening notes of Led Zeppelin's
	"Stairway to Heaven."  William gives his Mother the album
	cover's inner-sleeve with lyrics.

					WILLIAM 
			We ask you only to listen.

	Camera passes across their serious and expectant faces.  The
	intro in not short.  We listen, just watching their faces, as
	Elaine becomes increasingly impatient.


	  When is it going to start -   Soon.

	Immediately, overlapping, the vocal begins.  ("There's a lady
	who's sure all that glitters is gold.")





	Sprinklers click across the lawns.  ("... and it makes me
	wonder... ")



	Mom adjust herself in the chair, listens politely, checks her
	watch.  She looks at William.



	Sprinklers continue.  ("If there's a bustle in your hedgerow...




	Mom listens fitfully.  The song continues.





	Sprinklers shut off.  Music is now blasting.  ("To be a rock,
	and not to roll... ")



	Mom's face remains stoic to the bitter end.  ("... and she's
	buying the Stairway to Heaven.")  The song ends.  Silence.
	All look to Elaine.  They wait on her response.  We hear the
	turntable arm return to its cradle.


			What am I supposed to say?   You say
			it's Tolkien, fine.  They sound like
			nice kids.  Is it meant to elevate
			humanity?  "Sure, let's elevate
			humanity.  After we sell you drugs and
			sex."  All I have is my honesty.  That's
			what I believe, and that's what I know.
				
			Oh.  Here's a nice ad.

	She holds up the magazine.  And ad reads, in large bold type:


					ELAINE 
			You've clearly ganged up on me, and I
			still say no.  No no no no no no no.

	She shuts her eyes, and blurts out something against her better
	judgement.

					ELAINE 
			NO MORE THAN FOUR DAYS AND I WANT A





	William nods gratefully, and exits frame.  Hold on the empty
	chair, as drums herald the beginning of the Allman Brothers
	Band's "Trouble No More" from 



	who feels a very particular kind of loneliness.  It's the
	loneliness she got married, and then raised a family, to escape.



	An empty Heineken beer bottle rolls up and down the aisle,
	taking us to William.  William picks up the bottle and places
	it in the seat back pocket in front of him.  He has joined the
	circus, and the feeling of being here is a lot more lonely and
	forbidding than he expected.  The bus struggles to make it up
	the hill, back rows shuddering loudly, as music continues.


			C'mon, Doris!  Darling Bus.  You can
			make it!



	The Stillwater Tour Bus rumbles down the desert highway.  The
	destination banner reads - ALMOST FAMOUS -- TOUR 73.  Music
	continues.



	William strains for a look at Russell five rows up.  He plays
	slide guitar, working out a part.   Next to Russell is Penny
	Lane.  Penny raises an early-model Polaroid camera and - flash
	- takes a picture of a nearby sleeping Jeff Bebe.


			Gotcha.

	Jeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover.  Penny stuffs the
	shot in her pocket.  William watches, his private heart pounds.
	Polexia appears and sits next to him, noticing his shyness.


			Do you have any pot?





			Well, go do your job then.  You're on
			the road, man.  It's all happening!  Get
			in there.  Go talk to 'em!

	Challenged, William rises and approaches Russell.  He fixes
	the charismatic guitarist in his sights. Shot takes him down
	the aisle to the jamming star guitarist.  He crouches in the
	aisle and talks to Russell who immediately seems moody.  His
	mood is in the air.


				
			Russell.   Do you think we might be
			able to find some time to talk when we
			get to Phoenix?  I want to interview
			everyone separately... and I felt we'd
			start with you and me.

	Nearby, Jeff now listens in, feeling immediately jealous.


			Absolutely.

	Russell turns away.  The kid squats uncomfortably in the aisle,
	babbling on.


			Because I've got a thing in a couple
			days.


			What.


				
			It's a... thing where... uhm... you go
			there to graduate.  School.


				
			I  graduated.  And look what
			happened.  You're here interviewing 

	Good point.  Laughs from everybody listening nearby.  It's a
	good line.  William makes a quick jot in his notebook.

					RUSSELL 
			No no no.  Don't put Rolling
			Stone.  My bio says I graduated.  We'll
			come up with something better later.
			Just enjoy the ride.

	Russell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away.
	Penny notices William's discomfort, laughing warmly, all while
	grabbing a Coke and giving one to nearby bassist Larry.


			How did you know I was thirsty?

	He didn't even realize he was thirsty, but he is.  He nods
	thanks to Penny, the perfect road companion for all.  And then
	Penny gives the other Coke, her Coke, to William.  He accepts
	it too, and starts back to his seat.  He's been blown off, and
	he knows it, but before he exits Penny grabs his arm and
	whispers in his ear:


			I may need to stay in your room tonight.
			Russell's in a bad mood.  He's very
			 today.
			He's trying to write.

	William nods cooly -- they are comrades -- and returns to his
	seat.  A large joint passes in front of him, across him, to
	Polexia, as everyone cheers Doris the Bus rumbling up another
	hill.


				
			Want some?


			No thanks.

	A wall of pot smoke is exhaled, right into his face.  It
	surrounds him like a cloud.   The bus shudders, as Russell
	continues playing slide up ahead.



	Elaine sits in her living room, filled with her books.  Large
	Department store photos of her children on the wall.  She feels
	her own loneliness, and his too, as she dials a phone number.


			Has William Miller arrived yet?  He
			hasn't.  Could you give him a message
			as soon as you see him? -



	Several hours later on this ride.  Outside, night and desert.
	Inside, a few cigarettes, a joint of two glow in the darkness
	of the bus.  The end of the Led Zeppelin classic "Whole Lotta
	Love" plays from the bus stereo, full blast.  Everybody is
	free and anonymous in the dark.  They sing at full-volume.
	William looks out the window in wonder.


			"Way down inside... 
			woman...  you need... "

	The ten-ton guitar chord of Jimmy Page.

					ZEPPELIN/ALL 
			"Loooooooooooooooooooooooovvve... "

	John Bonham's drums thunder through the bus, everybody still
	singing as they dip down into the city ahead, Phoenix.  William
	watches the living documentary around him.  He writes furiously
	in the green notebook, scribbling in the dark, trying to steady
	his writing on the bumpy bus.  Behind him, someone is beating
	along to the song on his seat.  He never want to leave this world.



	All enter the lobby like warriors, in a pack.  The hotel chairs
	are spotted with curious hangers-on, decked out and lounging.
	Dick is already stationed, as always, at the front desk.   The
	sad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like Dick.  He
	is forever teaching others their jobs.


			Jeff, Tony... Keys... keys... keys...
			room list...
				(re: luggage, to hotel
			bellman)
			If it doesn't have a number on it, it
			ain't ours!

	He gives key and a stack of messages to Russell, and turns to
	William who he makes feel more important.  Penny is nearby with
	her suitcase and tackle box purse.  William watches Russell's
	guitars whisked away - they are luggage-numbered 1, 3, and 4.

					DICK 
			The Enemy!  Here you go, here's the key to
			your palatial suite, room list, plus let me
			give you a luggage tag.  You're Number 42.


			Is this Mr. Miller?  You have a message
			from Elaine.


			Thanks.


				
			She's a handful.


			I know.

	William cooly takes the folded message, doesn't look at it,
	and tries to pretend this embarrassing moment didn't happen.
	Jeff exchanges a look with Russell.  Nearby, the walking
	commotion arrives, clacking through the lobby.  It's Sapphire.
	Last night's clothes are now today's.  She holds a travel case,
	and hanger with some odd blouses.


			Finally, you're here!!  They kicked me
			out of my room!  Fuck Ozzy!

	She hugs Penny Lane.  Estrella appears, happy to have help
	with Sapphire.



	who approaches William.


			Come by in a few minutes.  We'll do
			the interview.

	The kid exits and goes to join Penny, who is still comforting
	Sapphire.  Russell looks through his messages.  The guitar,
	now in a case, never leaves his hand.  Jeff Bebe approaches,
	regarding William standing with Penny and the girls.  Intrigue
	is swirling in the lobby.


			I'm worried, man.


			Naw, we can trust him.  He's a fan.


  He looks
			harmless, but he does represent the
			magazine that trashed Eric Clapton,
			broke up Cream, ripped Led Zeppelin,
			and wrote that lame story about the
			Allman Brothers Band that bummed Duane
			out before he died.  Don't forget the
			Rules.  This little shit is the Enemy.
			He writes what he sees.
				
			But it would be cool to be on the cover.


			Leave it to me.  We'll get a good story.


			Plus our girlfriends read this magazine
			and -
				
			-- you know.


			You made your point.  I'll take to
			him.



	Penny speaks confidentially to him.  If she is slightly bossy,
	it is only because she's good at logistics, emotional and
	otherwise.


			Can Sapphire stay in your room tonight?
			She had a big fight with Ozzy, and
			Polexia's not working out with Jeff
			Bebe.
				
			You just have to remember... these
			guys are jealous, insecure, talented,
			egocentric, and manipulative geniuses...
			they're    They can say
			"I love you" to 20,000 people... but
			any fewer is a real problem.
				(girls nod, comforted, she
			continues to the kid)
			Jeff Bebe has so much jealousy over
			Russell that he can't express.  Plus,
			he never slept last night.   You keep
			Sapphire and I'll stay with Russell.

	William covers his disappointment over losing Penny as a
	roommate.  Cooly:


			Sure.  I'll take her.


			Me too?


			Sure.

	Estrella arrives with travel bag, equally homeless, looking
	hopeful.

					WILLIAM 
			If there's room -

	Penny squeezes him.  He  cool... but the girl he really
	wanted to stay in his room now joins Russell, disappearing
	into the elevator.  He looks down at the message in his hand,
	and opens it.

	It reads: DON'T TAKE DRUGS!  He snaps it closed quickly, before
	anyone can see.

	59A   IN. RUSSELL's ROOM -- NIGHT						59A

	Russell plays acoustic guitar, a notebook cradled on his lap.
	Trying to write.  It's coming slowly.  Shot moves off him,
	past a flickering television, onto Penny who silently and
	intently watches Russell as if he's a rare and beautiful bird.
	He looks over at her - she turns away quickly.  He goes back
	to work.  Tries to catch her watching him again.  She turns
	away just in time.



	Stillwater's "Fever Dog" plays from the t.v. radio.   William
	on the bed, a thick local phone book on his lap.   hotel
	room.  He watches self-consciously as the girls go about the
	ritual of inhabiting a room on the road.  Sapphire flutters a
	paisley scarf over the room lamp.  Polexia puts a towel along
	the crack of the door, blows out the glowing embers on too-
	many sticks of incense, and moves to the phone.  Estrella has
	joined them as well, complete with a bag full of shoes.
	Instantly, we have atmosphere and not much room left in this,
	the smallest room in the hotel.   William thumbs through the
	phone book with fascination.


			All these people.
				
			And they all live in 


				
			Hi Dad!!  I can't talk long!  I'm here in
			Paris.  I'm staying in another Youth Hostel
			with no phone and no address for mail!!


			(still wondrous, from phone
			 book)
			Alex.  


				
			I was the one who told him what to
			tattoo on his fingers, I was the one
			who made his shirts... I was 
			when his wife left him.





				



	She's reading from a European tour book.





				
			Oh my God.  Simon Kirke of Bad Company
			is 

	The girls mobilize by the window.  William is increasingly
	aware that he is an outsider in his own tiny room.  He tries
	to organize his stuff in the corner.





			Is anybody here as worried about Penny
			and Russell as I am?


				



	She winks at William, who looks away.


				
			Ooo, watch out - whoever you look at
			when you say that - that's who you
			really mean.

	Polexia hands up and throws a pillow at Sapphire,  the kid
	watches these girls like a tennis match.



	Russell puts down his guitar.


			You know.  We should talk about what
			we don't talk about.


			We don't have to.


			No, I - I went to Catholic school.  I
			believe in guilt and... you know, if
			there's any to be had, I pretty much
			want to roll around in it.


			I don't believe in attachments.  No
			boundaries.  Just the music.


			I'm just saying, it's okay to talk
			about it.

	Penny stands and turns.  She speaks the word.


			Leslie.

	Russell nods.  The name is out in the open.

					PENNY 
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.


				
			Alright - now we're talking.

	But she continues, saying the name in a multitude of different
	ways, in different accents, and with different degrees of
	indifference and passion and lust and play-acting and mock-
	drama.



	As he listens and studies this ethereal creature for meaning.
	Is she mocking him?   In love with him?  Taunting him?  Seducing
	him?


			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Lesssssslie.
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
			Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.  Leslie.
			LESlie.  Leslie...

	She continues saying it until it no longer has meaning.  And
	finally she sits next to him.

					PENNY 
				
			Now.  Have I helped you get that off
			your chest?

	They kiss.



	The girls continue their settling-in process.


			Opie, can I order room service?

	The nickname "Opie" re-opens a nagging wound.  Polexia hangs
	up, and begins to dial again.


			Okay.  You guys.  Wait.   Put down the
			phone, Polexia.
				
			First, this is my room...


			Come on, you're a fan like us.  You're
			on  side of the line.


			Second.  I'm not Opie.  Alright?  Opie
			is a little boy.  I'm here to do a
			job.  I am a 


				
			Ooooooo, sorry, Mr. 


			Third!
				
			... this phone is a big, big deal.  In
			a minute, I have to go interview
			Russell.  Do  answer this phone if it
			rings.  I have family members with
			 not
			understand.


				
			But what if  calls Sapphire?   And
			I gave Jimmy Page this number.


 like Jimmy Page.

	William looks at their troubled faces, full of too much-longing
	and too much make-up.


			Okay.   I have a solution.  Answer the
			phone.  But if anyone  an English
			accent is on the phone...
				
			Just hang up.  Or say it's the wrong
			room.

	They nod.  It's a good plan.



	The hanging sign on the door reads: DO NOT DISTURB. William
	knocks on Russell's door. A maid pushes up against him with
	her cart, which now blocks the hallway.




	A group of golf conventioneers are now trapped behind the maid
	cart.  They ease past William as he negotiates with Russell
	through the door.




















	We hear Penny's giggle.  Then the door opens, and it's Penny
	looking ravishing.  In the background, Russell sits shirtless
	at the table.  He playfully pelts the kid with crumpled up
	wads of hotel stationery.


			Don't worry.  Some to the radio
			interview.


			No, I'm fine.  I'll just interview
			Jeff Bebe some more.


				


	She shuts the door quickly.  It hurts a little.  He picks up
	the wadded pieces of paper, stuffs them in his pocket.  He
	leaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and
	matches from the nearby maid's cart.  Then he returns to
	Russell's door.  He can't help but listen to the muffled sounds
	of laughter, just for a moment, escalating.  He flips the sign
	over: HOUSEKEEPING PLEASE ENTER - CLEAN ROOM.



	Humble Pie.  "Thirty Days in the Hole."  Russell and band enter
	the radio station, passing through the now-empty front office.
	As always, Russell sets the tone.  He's feeling good.
	Stillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles,
	as they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold
	records  and head down the small hallway to the control room
	interview.  Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her
	green coat.  He tries to distance himself from her -- still a
	little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will
	have none of it.  She privately shares every great passing
	moment with him.  He tries not to succumb to these charms.
	It's hard.  Music segues to Stillwater's own "Fever Dog."



	Stillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone
	in this room.  Russell takes a seat near the open mike.  Jeff
	Bebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be
	just as close to the microphone as Russell.  William watches
	all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth.
	Stillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey QUINCE


	Quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it.
	The entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and
	ready for the interview.   William can't avoid looking at Penny
	Lane, who looks great tonight.  She catches him, and he barely
	looks away in time.  Polexia, newly reconciled with Jeff,
	notices.  The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the
	microphone, as the finale of "Fever Dog" is just ending.


			The guitar of Russell Hammond.   "Fever
			Dog"...  The band is Stillwater.
				
			Watch with your mind as they
			materialize.

	Band members gets closer to the microphone, preparing to speak.
	Quince lowers his head, shutting his eyes and getting into the
	music as the song plays out.



	The phone rings.  Estrella answers.


			William's room.



	Ben Fong-Torres is calling from 


			Can I please speak to him?  This is
			Ben Fong-Torres at 

	Estrella panics,  hangs up quickly, as if the phone has just
	caught fire.


			I think I just messed up!



	Quince raises his head and continues on-the-air.  The same
	song is still ending.


			Look at the dogs, wearing the funny
			hats.  Juggling just for you.  Freaks
			and family...

	Penny shoots William a look.   

					QUINCE 
			It's Quince, with Stillwater.  Here.
			Live.  It's the 

	The band scoots closer to the microphone, ready to talk.  Quince
	continues, looking meaningfully at the band.  They are
	waiting... eager for a chance to speak.

					QUINCE 
			Every minute a baby is born 
			Life.  Death.  Hermetically sealed
			bags of human emotion.  Bags of love...
			bags of kindness?
				
			How'd you get together?

	As Jeff eagerly speaks, Quince lowers his head and listens...
	feels... the words of his guests.


			Well... not to get into a "me" thing...
			this is Jeff talking... but I did start
			the band, some time, actually, ago.
			This is back when we were the Jeff
			Bebe band, and I placed an ad in a
			magazine called  looking for a
			guitarist and Russell Hammond answered.

	Quince nods, head bowed, swaying slowly.


				
			Peaches.

	Jeff watches Quince's head lower.  It's hard to know when to
	talk with Quince.  The depth of his mellowness is tough to get
	in rhythm with.


			I think he was a gift from God,
			actually.  Nobody plays like Russell
			Hammond.


				
			Well, shit.  Thank you.

	He instantly realizes he's slipped, on the air.

					RUSSELL 
			Ooops.  Better hit the delay button.

	All eyes turn to Quince, whose head stays down, grooving to
	some inner beat.  He says nothing.  The band looks at each
	other.  We become increasingly aware that Quince may now be
	asleep.  Long silence.  William shares an amazed look with
	Penny.  Quince is definitely asleep.  Russell leans forward
	and continues talking quietly, with hilarious sincerity.

					RUSSELL 
			Okay - we're talking now, right?  Why
			the fuck do you wait until and interview
			in Arizona to say something nice about
			me.  Why don't you say it to my fucking
			face sometime?  Because I tell you
			every time I think you nailed something.


			Everybody pays you compliments.  It's
			not my fucking job to kiss your fucking
			ass all the time.


			Well then who's fucking job is it?
			Because my ass is dying for a kiss.
			And I know yours is too.


			It's my fucking job.  You're all
			geniuses.  And let me just add this
			thought - 

	Penny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to William.
	He offers one back, as laughs are stifled throughout the room.
	William shares a look.  Quince is still deeply asleep, as the
	usually quiet tony leans forward to speak.


			Feces.

	He cracks himself up, silently.  Quince snaps awake, fully in-
	stride.


			The dong is called "Love Thing." Your
			mind is Starting to take effect.
			They're all here to see you swallow
			fire.  You scream soundlessly...  on the
			  It's Quince, with
			Stillwater.

	"Love Thing" takes over, as Quince swivels in the chair.

					QUINCE 
			I thought that went well.



	Adrenalized laughter.  The whole band is crammed into a medium-
	sized rental car.  Penny half on William's lap, half on
	Russell's.


				
			See, this is what 
			The in-between times!   This!  Us!
			Right now!!



	The phone is ringing.  Estrella emerges from the bathroom with
	no make-up and a t-shirt.  She picks up the phone.  Across the
	room, Sapphire signs for room service.  Now she is far too
	made-up.  The t.v. radio plays Free's "Fire and Water" in the
	b.g.


				
			Hello?





	It's Mom on the phone.


				
			May I speak with William please?


				
			He's not here.  I think he's in the
			bar with the Band.  They just got back
			from the radio station.  Is this Maryann
			with the pot?

	Silence.

					ESTRELLA 
			Hello?


			No this isn't Maryann with the pot.
			This is Elaine... his Mother.

	Estrella physically recoils.


				
			I thought you were English.


			Could you please give him a message?
			Could you tell him to call home
			immediately?  And could you also tell
			him -
				
			


			Alright.  Okay.  But I'm just going to
			say this, and I'm going to stand by
			it.
				
			You should be really proud of him.
			'Cause  and I'll bet you
			do too.  And he respects women, and he
			likes women, and let's just pause and
			appreciate a man like that.   You
			created him out of thin air, and you
			raised him right, and we're all looking
			out for him.  And that's more than
			I've ever said to my own parents, so
			there you go.
				
			This is the maid speaking, by the way.



	Russell and William sit in two large red-leatherette seats in
	the hotel lobby.  William shuffles through many pages of
	questions written in small script.  His tape recorder microphone
	sits balanced on the chair.


				
			Now that you're starting to be
			successful, you had twenty-six years
			to write your first Album... and you'll
			have maybe  for the second.
			Do you worry that the pressure of the
			business will get in the way of the
			original joy of making your music?  Or


	Russell blinks.  The all-consuming issues of his life are right
	in front of him.


			Whoa!
				
			I need three more beers and my guitar
			before I can answer that question.
			Let's take a walk.



	Russell walks the outskirts of the pool area with William.
	William follows him through the sliding glass door to his room,
	facing the pool.  Russell grabs his guitar.  They stand for a
	moment, unheard by the others, and regard the living portrait
	twenty yards in front of them.  The off-limits after-hours
	pool area has been overtaken by the Stillwater tour members.
	Jeff Bebe sits in a chair nearby.  Dick laughs at a joke.
	Always the life of the party, Penny Lane dispenses stolen towels
	from a maid cart.  And she is the first to slip into the pool
	for some after-hours, against-the-rules swimming.  Effortlessly,
	she turns a collection of people into a party.  They regard
	her, well out of earshot of the others.


			For a minute I thought you were actually
			a real journalist... which is... you
			know, it's great.
				
			Shut that thing off, and I'll tell you
			the truth.

	William shuts his tape recorder off.


			It's off.


			Look.  I trust you.  I'm going to lay
			this right on you.  Just make us look
			cool.


			I will quote you warmly and accurately.


			That's what I'm worried about.  See -
			some of us have girlfriends back home.
			Some of us have wives.  And... some of
			the people you meet on the road are
			really amazing people...

	They both watch Penny Lane, sparkling, fresh from the pool.
	She places hotel furniture into the shallow end and inviting
	all, even other curious hotel guests, to join them in the pool.

					RUSSELL 
			Like   And some of the things that
			happen are good for just a few people
			to know about - as opposed to, say, a
			 people.

	Dawn is breaking for William.


  Yeah.


			You know what I mean?


			Right.  Yeah.


			See, you're dangerous.  Most people
			are just waiting to talk, but you
			


			Right.  Right.


			So your question you asked me.  I think
			about It every fucking night.  The
			"business."  I hate it!
				
			I grew up with these guys, okay?  I
			can't play all that I can play, I'm
			 these musicians, do you understand?


			I do.


			The more popular we get, the more I
			can't walk on them, the bigger their
			houses get, the more pressure... you
			forget, man.  You forget what it was
			like to be real, to be a   You can
			hear it in a lot of bands who've been
			successful - it doesn't sound like
			music anymore.  It sounds like...
			like 
				
			I used to be able to hear the sounds
			of the world.  Everything, to me, used
			to sound like music.  Everything.  Now
			I don't hear it.   You know what I'm
			trying to say?


				
			Yeah.


			Man, it feels good to say this stuff
			out loud.  But what am I doing?  I'm
			telling secrets to the  guy you
			don't tell secrets to.


				
			No, that's okay.  We'll do the interview
			tomorrow.


			This is good.  So there's the "friend"
			and then there's the "interview guy."


			Yeah.


			So tonight it's "friend".... and when
			we wake up tomorrow - ""
			We'll figure it out as we go, buddy.


			Hey - for whatever it's worth - you
			guys are really good.

	Russell laughs at the kid's easy naivete.  He hands his guitar
	to the kid, and joins the party.  William watches, part of the
	crowd... somehow feeling a little compromised.  He doesn't
	care.  Penny gestures for him to join them.



	William interviews Larry in the seats of the empty arena.  On
	stage, Ed soundchecks his drums.


			How would you describe your role in
			Stillwater?  What is the chemical that
			you add to the chemistry?


			I'm the bass-player.


				
			Right.  And when you take that away...
			what would be missing?  Stylistically?
			What 


				
			The bass?

	Larry doesn't give him much.



	It's raining.  The pre-show huddle breaks up, William a part
	of them.  Penny Lane adjusts Larry's look.  She takes the scarf
	from around his neck and ties it around his leg.  He looks
	instantly better.  William watches in the darkness as Dick
	takes the microphone.  The best part of his day has arrived.
	In his important voice:


			Good evening Phoenix.
				
			From Troy, Michigan.  Please welcome,
			

	Lights come up, as the band launches into "Fever Dog."   Jeff
	begins singing.  Russell reaches to adjust the microphone for
	a back-up vocal and is hit with something unexpected.

	A sharp electrical 

	It's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a
	moment something is clearly wrong.  Russell holds onto the
	microphone stand with a surprised look, conducting high-voltage
	for two seconds and then he  his hand off the metal.  His
	face is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off-stage,
	collapsing a couple steps later.



	Dick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus, which has
	been pulled up into the backstage area.   He guides a sagging
	Russell, assisted by Penny Lane, into the bus.


			Get in, get in!!

	William boards the bus, as the extremely agitated PROMOTER
	arrives to confront Dick.


			Are you the manager of this band?


			That, and more.  Get in!


			You didn't even play a full set!

	Dick whirls and unleashes an anger we've not yet seen, gesturing
	with the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand.


			Your shoddy stage set-up almost killed
			our guitarist!


			You trashed the dressing room - you
			didn't play your thirty-five minutes.
			You didn't fulfill your contract -


			Everybody in!  Get in the bus!


			I'll report you to every promoter in
			the country!  I'm gonna talk to Frank
			Barcelona!





			I hope you have a good lawyer.




	He swings into the bus, as the bus revs.






	Russell sits, pale, next to Penny at the front of the bus.  He
	examines his singed hand, shaking it a little to emphasize the
	positivity of her words.


			Don't worry.  It's happened to all the
			greats.  Thank God you didn't hold the
			mike stand with both hands, you'd still
			be holding it.  This is a good thing.
			It's a good, good, good thing.

	William sits nearby, watching Russell, making notes out of eye-
	sight of others.  The ever-wary Jeff, unseen by William, cranes
	to see that he's writing in his notebook.

	Dick swings into the seat across from Russell.  The bus door
	shuts, as the promoter is still yelling.

	Doris is slow to gain speed, as Estrella appears, running
	alongside.  She knocks on the window next to William.


			I forgot to tell you!  Your mom says
			to call home immediately.  She says
			
				
			See you guys in Topeka!  I'll catch a
			ride with Sabbath!

	William nods with embarrassment, waves to her, as the bus races
	toward the now closing gate.


				
			Wanna buy a gate?

	Before Russell can answer - BASH.  Doris barrels through the
	steel-gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside
	this bus.

					DICK 
			You just bought a gate.
				
			C'mon Doris!!  Get us out of town!!

	The bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for
	Doris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a
	thoroughfare.


			What did it feel like to be
			electrocuted?


			It burns.  It feels like a dose of
			lead shooting through your body... and
			then you see God, and he says, "How
			bad do you want to be legendary?" And
			god   I let go.
				(shaky grin as all laugh
			warmly)
			Rock and roll.

	Jeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy.  The kid
	scribbles in his notebook.  We hear Led Zeppelin's "That's the
	Way."



	Song continues.  Almost everybody is asleep.  William takes
	the camera and snaps a Polaroid of a sleeping Penny.  She wakes
	up.


			Give that to me.

	She grabs for it, they have a brief play-fight.  He grabs some
	other Polaroids from her pocket.  He hustles to the back of
	the bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the
	passing landscapes.  She chases him down the aisle.  Music
	continues as she sits down next to him.  Out the window, a
	long-distance running team of Girls keeps pace with the bus
	for a bit.  They wave.  Penny watches them over sunglasses,
	waves briefly to the real world.

					PENNY 
				(breathing heavy, owning
			the world)
			When we go to Morocco, I think we should
			wear completely different clothes, and
			be completely different people.


			What will our names be?

	She snaps a Polaroid of a nearby sleeping Silent Ed, pockets
	the Polaroid.  She regards Russell up ahead, also sleeping.
	Her attention has already wandered from Morocco.


			What do you think of Russell?


			I like him.


			You're coming to Cleveland, right?


  Oh no no no.  I gotta
			get my interview with Russell before
			  And you've got to help
			me.  Okay?  Friends... remember?

	Penny is still watching Russell.


			You should give him a break.  There
			are real problems in the band.   Off
			the record.

	Gravely noting the word "problems", the kid joins Penny in
	watching Russell, who is splayed haphazardly, sleeping
	restlessly up ahead.


			What problems?


			Okay.  I got it.  I think your name
			should be Spencer, and mine will be
			Jane.


			I can't keep up with you.


			No one can.


			What's your real name?

	She looks at him briefly.  She puts her arm around him.  It's
	intoxicating, but he doesn't quite know how to act.  With her
	free hand, she gestures with a hanger.  As they regard Russell
	sleeping nearby:


			Here's the thing about Russell.  He's
			my last project.  I only do this for a
			very few people.  And I think we should
			do it together - he is almost great.
			We've got to take him there.  You and
			me - we can do it.  Deal?  Because the
			other guys are good - but he could be
			great.  He's my last project.

	He looks at her.  She imitates his face back to him.

					PENNY 
			It's all happening.



	William sits interviewing Silent Ed by some equipment cases.


			What do you love about music?

	Ed looks at him thoughtfully.  It is an eloquent moment.  He
	thinks.  He shrugs.  The kid tumbles with more questions.
	These interviews are not going well.



	William, looking concerned over the state of his interviews,
	walks into the backstage bathroom.  He makes a few surreptitious
	notes in his notebook before noticing that Jeff is standing
	there, clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered
	by a Local Hanger-On.  Seeing the kid, he immediately hides
	the coke spoon.


			Hey.


			Hey.

	William pretends he sees nothing as he turns to the urinal,
	and shot stays on Jeff, who looks a little high and a little
	worried.



	William is on the pay phone with his Mother.  The show booms
	in the background.


			I know.  I know.  I know.
				
			I know.  Mom.  Mom... Mom.



	Stillwater on-stage.  A great show.  Russell on fire.



	William on the phone.  Estrella leans on him, fixing her shoe.


			Right now -- Topeka.  Then Greenville.
			Then home.

	He winces slightly, holds the phone away from his ear for a
	moment.

					WILLIAM 
			I'm sorry I didn't call yesterday!
			It's not like you can just carry a
			phone around with you.



	Mom sits in her school office, a miniature version of her home
	- a fortress in which she is surrounded by books.  The sun is
	going down.  She can't resist a sentimental moment.


			I guess I just miss you, and I don't
			understand why I've driven both my
			kids so far away from me.  By all
			practical rules don't I get you for
			three more years?

	He is touched by her vulnerability, more visible now than ever,
	as music continues in b.g.

					ELAINE 
			Was I not fun?



	William has his finger in his ear.  The din if Stillwater's
	set now blots out all other noise.  It is not the time to answer
	this question.


			I missed the last thing you said.

	Mom takes a pause.




	Penny now enters, watching.





				


	William now notices Penny standing nearby, picking at a salad
	from a paper dish.  Looking at her, he lets loose with what he
	believes is a private confession.




	Penny smiles knowingly, collecting his affection like another
	backstage pass, and turns away.  Camera stays on William.  He
	is suddenly and deeply embarrassed.  He's just told her that
	he loves her and she knows it.  He hangs up, traumatized.



	Russell's hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished.
	He is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders.   Luggage
	for the next city is stacked by the door.


			Fire away.  I'm ready.  I'm on the
			"You" Train.  Take me there.

	The kid plugs in his microphone.  Russell listens as he springs
	his first question.


			Do you have to be depressed to write a
			sad song?  Do you have to be in love
			to write a love song?  Is a song better
			if it really happened to you?  Like,
			"If You Say Nothing"... where did you
			write that and how did it come about?

	Russell admires the many questions.  Says nothing.  He looks
	at his hand, thinks.


			When did you get so professional?

	In the background, Penny Lane irons Silent Ed's shirt.
	Grinning, she cuffs his shoulder.  To the shirtless silent
	drummer, waiting for his shirt.


			I'm almost done with my shirt.

	Ed watches her appreciatively, drumming silently on a rubber
	pad.  Penny kisses Russell, who swings her onto his lap.  In
	the corner, Jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being
	underappreciated.  And now Dick enters with a large cardboard
	box.


			Russell, your dad showed up again.
			And on a lighter note.
				
			Gentlemen.  Your first t-shirts have
			arrived.

	There is an immediate buzz in the room, as Dick yanks open the
	box filled with new white t-shirts.  He untangles the first fresh
	shirt, and displays it proudly.  A silent beat as all examine it -
	their first t-shirt.  Faces fall.  Ed stops drumming.  There has
	been a mistake.  It is a fuzzy band photo with the group name
	emblazoned below.  Only Russell, who stand out front, is colored-
	in and emphasized on the shirt.  He turns away, making a noise.
	Jeff stares at the t-shirt.  He's just about in tears.  There is
	a long silence and then... Ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad.

					DICK 
			It's the record company's mistake.
			And they will   Shirts gone, band
			happy.

	He drops the offending shirt into the trash, as if it were
	contaminated, and exits with the box.  William watches as the
	two men, Russell and Jeff, move to opposite sides of the room.
	Russell puts on a shirt, so does Jeff.  The vibe is thick.
	Russel turns to see Jeff staring at him.


			Can we just skip the vibe and go
			straight to us laughing about this?


				
			Yeah.  Okay.


				
			Because I can see by your face - you
			 to get into this -


			How can you tell?  I'm just one of the
			out-of-focus guys.


			Here we go.

	William watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash.

					RUSSELL 
			Here.  Take it.  You LOVE this shirt -
			it lets you say everything you want to
			say.


			Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.




	Russell turns away.


			I'm always gonna tell you the truth.


			Are you doing coke again?




	The kid looks down.

					JEFF 
			This is big stuff, man.  From the very
			beginning -- we said -- I'm the front
			man and you're the guitarist with
			mystique.  That's the dynamic we agreed
			on -- Page, Plant... Mick, Keith.  But
			somehow it's all turning around.  We
			have got to control what's happening
			to us.  There's a responsibility here -


			Excuse me, but didn't we all get into
			this to  responsibility?


			Forgive me.
				
			But this is the slow-moving train of
			compromise that will  us.

	Russell makes a disgusted noise.  Penny Lane exits discreetly,
	looking back at William.

					JEFF 
			I can't say anymore with a writer here.


			You can trust him,  you can say whatever
			you want.


				
			I works as hard or  than anybody
			on that stage.  You know what I do - I
			  I look
			for the guy who isn't getting off, and
			I 
				
			Actually, that you can print.
				
			And yet, why do I always end up feeling
			like I'm a joke to you?  I feel nothing
			but love for you.  We're a family.

	He looks at the t-shirt and starts to cry.  Embarrassed, he
	grows angrier.

					JEFF 
			You want to pretend this isn't going
			to be a very big band.  Well it is.  You
			call yourself a leader of this band, but
			your direction allowed the t-shirt, when
			you allowed Dick to manage us, 'cause
			he's your friend... don't you see?  The
			t-shirt is 


			Is it my turn?  Because I think we
			should, for once, say what we 
			mean.


			Oh, this is the part where you quit -


				
			Right.  I'm so predictable.


			No  I gotta tell the truth -- I want
			you to like me.  But sometimes I feel
			like you collect people who love you
			and then very skillfully... you make
			them feel bad that they're not good
			enough for you.


			Stick to singing, brother, 'cause you
			ain't gonna make it as a shrink.


			Deal with it!  And let me just say
			what nobody Else wants to say to you -


			What?


			Your looks have become a problem.



	Russell walks swiftly past a happy silver-haired man, who holds
	court with beer in hand.  He dresses too young for his age,
	late fifties.  He is DAD.


			Son!


				
			Hello Harry.

	Dad introduces a woman much younger, who eyes Russell hungrily.


			He got all the good genes, huh?  Meet
			Deirdre.  We're getting married in
			July.



	Russell walks fast outside the arena.  William hustles to catch
	up.  The two men walk in long silent strides in the cold night
	air, beyond the backstage area.  Fans begin to recognize and
	follow at a discreet distance.


			You okay?  You alright?

	Russell doesn't answer.


				
			From here on out, I'm only interested
			in what's 

	The kid nods.  They walk.

					RUSSELL 
			Real feelings.  Real people.  That's
			all I'm interested in...  From here on
			out.  What is REAL?    real.


			Thanks.

	A wave of warmth comes over Russell.


			You know, you know all about us and I
			don't know  about you.
				
			What's your... your family like?  Tell
			me.


			Well, my dad died of a heart attack
			and my sister believes that my Mom is
			so intense that she might have
			contributed to it.  Plus -


				
			Okay, that's good.  That's enough.


			It's good to talk about it.  Really
			good.

	Russel now sees some hero worship in the kid's face, and it
	makes him nervous.

					WILLIAM 
			Hey, man, maybe we should go back.


			If they want me, they can find me.

	William turns and sees nobody following but fans.


			So listen.  I have to go home tomorrow.
			I know this is a bad time to finish
			our interview.


			Hey, man, you know what?  Write whatever
			you want.  I trust you.

	A big square Chevy van slows down.  A CONCERT-GOER hands his
	head out the window.


				
			Woooooooooo!!!  You're Russel from
			Stillwater!!


			On my better days, yes.  I am "Woooooo,
			Russell from Stillwater!"


			Wanna go to a party at my friend Aaron's
			house?!  I know you're a big rock star,
			but do you want to hang with some people
			looking to have a good time?

	Russel regards the van full of kids.  More fans crowding
	around.  The kid behind the wheel unknowingly says the magic
	words.

					CONCERT-GOER 
			We're just real Topeka people, man.

	He has said the magic word.



	Russell arrives at the party in the rural outskirts of Topeka.
	William nearby.



	William watches as Russell slugs from a Jack Daniels bottle.
	They sit in the bedroom of a mindblown fan, 17 year-old AARON.
	He has long frizzy brown hair, tied in a spray behind him.
	Many from the neighborhood are now pouring into the home.


				
			You.  Aaron.  Are what 
			You are   Your room is real.
			Your friends are real.  You are more
			important than... than... all the silly
			  In eleven
			years it's gonna be  man.  Think
			about 


			Wanna see me feed a mouse to my snake?





			Can I have your belt?


			Take it!

	Russel whips off his belt, gives it to the fan.  A joint goes
	by, headed for Russell.  William intercepts it and passes it
	on.

					RUSSELL 
			Aaron?    I want
			to live here. I want to eat your food,
			and live in your city and fuckin 
			like I used to.  I want to learn
			everything there is to know about your
			city and your town.  And your way of
			being 
				
			


			Down the hall by the washing machine.


			What?


			The bathroom.


			Okay.  Good to know.

	Russell rises and squeezes past fans and heads down the hall.



	William follows Russell protectively.




	A QUIET GIRL, 14, turns and watches Russell pass.  We linger
	on her face for just a moment, full of wonder.


			We should probably head back sometime.

	Russell ignores him.


				
			Watch out, there's acid in the beer
			that's in the Red cups.

	Russell looks at the cup in his own hand.  It's white.  Then,
	with his other hand, he grabs the red cup and drains it.
	William winces.  They move on.


			Topeka.  Check it out.

	Russell enters the bathroom.  William stands guard.  With a
	finger outstretched from each hand, he lectures the fans massing
	in the hallway.


			Please don't give him any more acid.



	William watches as a wobbly Russell Hammond, in sunglasses
	now, goes through Aaron's record collection.  He places the
	albums over his face, like masks.



			None of these people are gonna be around
			in twenty years!  Plastic begets
			plastic!!   Black 

	Partygoers are strangely fascinated by the rock star in their
	living room.





	William waits anxiously to use the phone, keeping an eye on
	Russell.  Russell is now strangely twisting/dancing with four
	girls in the living room, as more cars arrive outside.


			He's here right now!  Go ahead and put
			it Out over the radio, tell people to
			bring food And beer and chicks.  We're
			at Rural Route # 4 -


			No no.  Nope.  No.

	William takes the phone and hangs up.  Keeping an eye on Russell
	in the next room, he dials from a tour itinerary sheet.

					WILLIAM 
			Dick Roswell, please?
				
			Dick!!  I got him!!  He's okay... I've
			been Looking after him.  He's on acid,
			though.  I can't Really tell.  How do
			you know when it's "kicked in?"



	Russel stands on the jutting corner of the house rooftop.
	The unlit, unheated greenish family pool beckons to him below.
	It's kicked in.


				


	Russell cackles at the joke of it all.  William yells up from
	down below.


			Hey Russell -





			Don't jump, okay?



			my last words were -

	He spreads his arms, and tries to think of last words.

					RUSSELL 
			-- 

	The kids cheer.  William looks around, remains cool.  Yells
	upward in the cold night air.


			I think we should work on those last
			words.


			Critic!!


			No, I'm not -


			Okay I got it.  I got it.  I got it.
			I got it.   This is better.  Last words

				(spreads his arms, his
			greatest realization)
			

	It gets a skimpy reaction from the partygoers.

					RUSSELL 
				
			

	They applaud again.


			Just come on down!!


				
			Okay.

	He  from the roof into the cold, algaed water below.  He
	sinks immediately.  One kid jumps in, then another, then more.

	



	It's getting lighter.  Cars line the street.  And now, finally
	turning the corner, is Doris the Bus.



	William watches the effects of personal charisma.  Wet
	partygoers surround Russell, bottle of Jack Daniels still in
	hand,  wrapped in towels.  Now a bond has passes between them,
	all of them.  Algae drips from the corner of Russell's face
	and neck.


			Thanks for saving my life.  I won't
			hold it against you.

	Twenty different kids thank him for the opportunity.  ("Glad
	to do it," "Right on," "Damn straight.")



	Door opens.  Dick enters.  Finding the guitarist in the kitchen,
	he clicks into time-tested road-managerial maintenance.  Easing
	Russell out of his towel, slipping his own jacket around him,
	from Russell's hands.


				
			They've been crying for you like a
			bunch of whimpering pussies --


				
			The band is over.  This is my family
			now.


			Right on.  He's staying with us.


				
			Definitely.  It's all over.  We'll
			just ride on to Greenville, listen to
			some great music, finish the tour, and
			leave those ungrateful fools behind.
			And then we'll come back here, where
			you'll live.


I like
			it.
				
			Look at him.  He's taking notes with
			his eyes.
				
			How do we know he's not a 

	William laughs painfully, as Russell moves in, eyes flaring
	with sudden paranoia.

					RUSSELL 
			


				
			Easy.  He's your Guardian Angel.

	Russell turns away.  William shrugs with style, but his
	lingering look is filled with hurt.  Dick guides Russell to
	the door, grabbing the kid and talking very directly to him as
	they move.

					DICK 
			Don't worry.  He only means half of
			what he says.


			Which half?


			Good question.


				
			I have a lot more.  Just help me get
			my interview so I can go home from
			Greenville.  I have to go home.
				
			


			Hey.  You saved the tour.   That's
			good enough for now.

	Frustrated but feeling important, William hands him some of
	Russell's wet clothes. William deftly retrieves Russell's shoes
	and smoothly plucks the guitarist's sunglasses from the
	partygoer who also wears his belt.  They move to the door in a
	pack.  We hear the beginning of Elton John's "Tiny Dancer."
	Dick faces the crowd and addresses them in his "important"
	stage voice.

					DICK 
			Ladies and Gentlemen, the evening is
			over!  We hope you've enjoyed
			yourselves, and we'll See you again in
			

	William gives Russell his sunglasses to face the sunlight.
	Russell stumbles out of the house to great cheers.  The Quiet
	Girl breaks free to catch Russell on the way out.


			I'll never forget you.

	Dick pats William's arm one more time --   They leave
	Aaron's house as legends.



	"Tiny Dancer" continues on the bus stereo.  Russell sits up
	front, swathed in a large robe, alone and silent.   The others
	have given him a wide berth.  He feels silly, and they know
	it, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel
	foolish.  He sits silently.  William watches him from four
	rows back, next to Penny.  She kisses the top of his forehead,
	a hero's welcome. He yawns. The song's vocal begins.  There is
	only more silence.  Then, after a beat, we hear a voice or
	two, fighting the quiet and singing along.  Then others...
	waking up... joining in.  Then Jeff.  Russell hears them and
	starts to sing along too, louder now, without turning around.
	It's a voice everyone wants to hear.  Like it or not, this is
	his family.







	Passing signs announce Greenville, North Carolina.



	Lester on the phone.  He is paler than ever, in a room clogged
	with vinyl, happily listening to the MC5 in the background.


			How's it going?





	It's a small wooden-walled hotel room in Greenville.  Polexia
	tries on clothes.  William barely notices as he talks to Lester
	on the phone.


 is calling me.  I don't
			have my key interview.  I don't know
			what to say.


				(pacing, assembling thoughts
			with his hands)
			You're flipping out.  That's good.
			Alright.  This is how you blow their
			minds.  He'll ask you - this is Ben
			Fong-Torres, right? - he'll ask you
			how the story's going.  Here's what
			you do - let's fry his mind.  Tell him
			"it's a think piece about a mid-level
			band struggling with their own
			limitations in the harsh face of
			stardom."  Ha ha!!  This is fun!

	William scrambles to make notes.


				
			... think... piece...



	Longhand small script on yellow legal tablets.



	William sits in the tub, without water.  It's his makeshift
	office, he's surrounded with scraps of notepaper.  He writes
	savagely, and now, savagely throws it away.



	In the bedroom, Sapphire, Polexia and Penny watch The Midnight
	Special.  Sapphire looks at a room service menu.


			It says the food is hearty and
			adventurous.


				
			Greenville.  I'm bored.

	Penny yawns too, it's catchy, and rises to visit the bathroom.

					POLEXIA 
			Hey let's deflower the kid.

	Now Sapphire yawns, looks in her purse.


			Who his the quaaludes from me?



	Penny enters to see William writing in the tub.  She sits on
	the toilet to pee.  Flustered:


			Wait.  I'll leave.

	He gets up, knocking his carefully organized notes onto the
	floor.  He is brimming with things to say.  More than he is
	even able to communicate.

					WILLIAM 
			You know, I think this is going
			backwards for me.


			Backwards?


				
			I don't know.  I just thought we could
			hang out, maybe do some stuff back
			home, regular stuff, get to know each
			other better... and  I'd see you
			pee.  I mean, that's the way I usually
			do it.


			You're one of us.  It's no big deal.


 one of you.


			Oh!  If you go to Cleveland, Bowie's
			going to be there at Swingo's, the
			greatest hotel in America.  I'll
			introduce you to him, and his security
			guy Dennis.

	William stops at the door.


			Don't you have any regular friends?


			Famous people are just more interesting.

	He looks at her.  Even sitting on the can, she's elegant and
	totally focused on him.


				
			Well, I would be worried that they
			were using   And not that anybody's
			using you, but -

	She swoons a little, touched and moved.


			Boy, if this was the real world and
			some guy talked to me like that -


			Let me finish.
				
			I'm not famous.... but you could always
			use    If anything happens.  And I
			would never use you.  Even if I got
			famous.  So you know, you always have
			that from me... in the real world.  If
			you ever have to go back there, for
			anything.

	She looks at him curiously, as the door blasts open.  Sapphire
	and Polexia head for William.


			Your time has come.


			Did he call?
				
			What are you -- stop it -- we're talking
			here.


			Pants him.  Opie must die.

	They swarm him, dragging him kicking into the bedroom.



	Steely Dan, looking pale and somehow snappy, perform "Do It
	Again" on   The girls force William onto
	the bed, and envelope him.  Their sexuality is fun, untroubled.
	Shot moves past bodies crossing frame, onto William's face.



	Across room, sitting and watching.


			Just relax.  Take a vacation from
			yourself.  Leave this to professionals.

	Estrella and Polexia kiss each other playfully.  William looks
	confused.  Across the room, Penny laughs, turns up the TV,
	blows him a kiss.

	Penny's eyes.  Across the room.

	His eyes.

	His sexual awakening may be downtime amusement for them, but
	to him it's an embarrassingly  intense moment he shares only
	with Penny Lane -- across the room.  She turns away, smiling,
	disappears into the next room.



	On the television.





	Post-sex pajama party.  Sapphire, Estrella, and Polexia girltalk
	about their first rock and roll conquests.  Penny is conspicuous
	by her absence.  William is under the sheets, listening, feeling
	different, now a man and somehow one of the girls too.





	William is awake.  Sunlight floods in from the corners of the
	window-shades.  He is surrounded by the fallen cavalry of the
	night before... Sapphire and Polexia.  The phone rings, and
	Sapphire instantly snaps it up, still asleep.  Lost in her
	dreams, she offers the sexiest hello ever.


				
			Rolling
			Stone.

	William snatches the phone.


				
			Hello.



	Ben Fong-Torres is up bright and early.


			Hello William, this is your editor at --

	He offers the name of the magazine with a swirl that implies
	

					BEN 
			  How's the story?



	William snaps into his very professional tone of equally grave
	importance.


			I'm getting good stuff out here.


			Sounds like it.

	Next to him, Polexia yawns herself awake.


			Man, I need some -

	He clamps a hand over her mouth.


				
			Now listen.  Get it together.  We're
			both professionals, I don't have to
			tell you this.  You're not out there
			to join the party -- we already have
			one Hunter Thompson.  You're out there
			to interview and Report.  You got me?
			This isn't Rolling
			Stone.  We need this story in four
			days.  Now I want to know how it's
			shaping up.


			It's a think-piece about a mid-level
			band grappling with their limitations
			in the face of the harsh glare of
			success.


				
			I like what we're saying.  Let me try
			and get you a thousand more words.
			It's in consideration for the cover,
			but don't tell the band.


				
			Crazy.

	The kid hangs up, now shouldering even more pressure.  He
	unclamps Polexia's mouth.


			- coffee.



				
			Any other city in the world and you'd
			still be a virgin.


			I'm going out to find Russell.


			Will you take the laundry?


				
			What am I to you?  Tell me right now!
			What. Am.  I.  To.  You.



	Circles have sprouted up under William's eyes.  The orange bag
	strapped over his shoulder, he lugs a  bag of laundry.  He
	consults room list.  A variety of noises and smells drift from
	the band rooms.  He sees Room Service arrive at Dick's door,
	and it's Estrella who opens the door.  (Dick in the
	background.)  She smiles sweetly to William -- good morning --
	as the door shuts.


			Houdini... Houdini...

	He arrives at Russell's door.  Two exclamation points have
	been Sharpie-markered to the words Do Not Disturb on the sign
	is gaffer-taped to his door.  He looks through the crack, at
	the bottom of the door.  Carefully and politely, he knocks.
	Instantly:




	Pissed, the kid flips off the door.  He sits down on a chair
	directly across from the room.  Push in on William, who is
	more pent-up than ever.  He tries hard not to cry, taking
	gulps of air as a maid cart swishes past, revealing... he's
	failed.  He cries.



	A super-energized Russell Hammond looks into William's sleepy
	face.  William's eyes open.  His own sleepy face is evident in
	Russell's sunglasses.  The bag of laundry is still at his feet.

					RUSSELL 
			We'll do the interview in Cleveland!


			No.  I can't.  You've got to help me.
			I have to go home.


			Come on man, we'll have more time there.
			Don't be tense!!

	He begins rubbing the kid's shoulders.  He's waking up.  There's
	Penny, also rubbing his shoulders.  It is degrading... and
	somehow cool too.


				
			You said you'd help me.


				
			Come to Cleveland.


				
			Come to Cleveland... Come to
			Cleveland...


			I can't!!


			Can we help it if we like having you
			around!

	William is a bundle of nerves and exhaustion now.  Embarrassed
	and frustrated.

					RUSSELL 
			Cleveland, my man.  You can't miss out
			on the Rock Mecca of the midwest -
			you're with us.  It's all happening!


			Rock and roll!


				
			Rock and roll.

	We hear David Bowie's live version of "Waiting for the Man."



	They sit together, hair askew, in sunglasses, resting against
	the headboard.  Carefully, Russell identifies his thoughts.


			I feel... like his parents.

	Penny runs a worried hand through her hair.


			I know.


			I wonder how that happened.


			You ever notice that all our sentences
			begin with "I?"


			I hadn't, no.


			'Cause we should work on that.

	He looks at her, plays the guitar a little.



	Night.  Doris rocks toward Cleveland on a muggy summer night.
	The windows of passing houses offer rich Edward Hopper glimpses
	of lives and people William will never meet.



	William watches from his bus bunk at the back, head on elbow.
	Looking up, he sees the rhythmic motion of bodies on the
	mattress above him, as music continues.

	William gets up, nods hello to the Roadie and his Date on the
	bunk above.  He moves down the aisle... to the seats near the
	front.  A sleeping Russell sits upright, hugging his guitar.
	Penny asleep next to him, Polaroid in her hand of... Russell
	sleeping.  The kid moves on.  He sits with the Bus Driver,
	whose CB crackles with chatter from other tour buses headed to
	Cleveland.



	Cleveland signs.  Music rises.  Heads pop awake.


			Cleveland!



	Like a slow-moving shark, Doris pulls into empty downtown
	Cleveland.  The streets are empty.  They pass the Agoura
	Ballroom, where a man with a long stick arranges the letters
	Stillwater on the marquee.   Applause in the bus.



	Russell and band enter like warriors, in a pack.  William sags
	with the heavy bags in hand and over his shoulder.  Here, in
	the middle of the midwest, is an explosive rock mecca, just as
	promised.   The feeling of belonging invades all those in this
	lobby.  Fans and other touring rockers mingle together.
	Outside in the real world, everyone else is going to work.


			It's Bowie!

	The lobby ignites, as William stands near Penny and Russell.
	Bowie races from a limousine through the lobby and into the
	elevators.  He is shrouded by a jacket.  Just the top of his
	electric red hair travels the lobby, as he's hustled by security
	man Dennis in the elevator.  And out of the chaos comes...



	Jeff Bebe and Polexia smash against the wall of the Swingo's
	hotel room, making love.



	Russell and Penny Lane smash against their own wall.



	Dick squats at the front of the stage, and talks to a few fans
	in the front row of this crowd.



	A wild Cleveland crowd in the building.  The cities on this
	tour are getting bigger, and so are the audiences.  And there
	is a whiff of business now too.  Men in satin tour jackets and
	some Disc-jockey types cruise the backstage.  A Hysterical Fan
	is led screaming to the nearby medic room.  Few even react -
	it's Cleveland - as the shot finds William, tired and yawning,
	on the backstage pay phone.  He is absolutely ready for the
	worst.


			Hi Mom.  I'm in Cleveland.

	He listens stoically.  Larry and Ed watch nearby.





	Moms sits in silence.

					WILLIAM 
				
			I'm fine! I'm fine!  I'm flying back on
			Monday Morning.  I'll only miss one
			test.  I'll make it up.

	Russell listens in, holding his guitar, laughing.


			Tell her you're a slave to the groove
			- you can't help it!


				
			No.

	Russell grabs the phone, talks to the silent mother on the
	other end.


			Hi Mom!  It's Russell Hammond, I play
			guitar in Stillwater!   It's my fault.
			How does it feel to be the mother of
			the future of rock journalism?
				
			Hello?

	Silence.   Penny passes and stands near William, smoothing her
	pass.  They watch a new pack of groupies prowl the road-crew.
	They are more glam, more trashy and less selective.  They glare
	insolently at Penny Lane.  This is the future.

					RUSSELL 
			You've got a great kid -- nothing to
			worry about!  We're taking care of
			him!  And you should come to a show
			sometime!  Join the Circus!


			Listen to me.   Your charm does not
			work on me.  I'm onto you.  Of 
			you like him.


			Yes.


			He worships you people and that's fine
			with you, as long as he helps make you
			rich.


				
			Rich?  I don't think so -


			Listen to me.  He's a smart, good-
			hearted, 15 year-old kid, with infinite
			potential.

	Russel looks over at the kid, eyes narrowing as he processes
	the truth.  He's 

					ELAINE 
			This is not some apron-wearing mother
			you're talking to.  I know about your
			Valhalla of Decadence, and I shouldn't
			have let him go.  He is not ready for
			your world of compromised values, and
			diminished brain cells that you throw
			away like confetti.  Am I speaking
			clearly to you?


			Yes, ma'am.


			If you break his spirit, harm him in
			any way, keep him from his chosen
			profession -- which is  Something
			you may not value but  do -- you will
			meet the voice on the other end of
			this telephone.  And it will not be
			pretty.    Do we understand each other?


			Yes... yes...


				
			I didn't ask for this role, but I'll
			play it.  Now go do your best.  "Be
			bold and mighty forces will come to
			your aide!"  Goethe said that.  It's
			not too late for you to be a person of
			substance.  Get my son home safely,
			I'm glad we spoke.

	She hangs up.  Russell hangs up, oddly affected and shook up.


			Some people get her.  Some don't.

	Russell is still recovering.  William feels embarrassed by his
	mother, once again.



	William with the band.  He yawns, as the band breaks.  Cleveland
	awaits.  We follow Dick, who guides the band onto the stage
	platform, still in darkness.  Already, stomping and applause
	is mounting.  Russell turns to William before taking the stage:


			Your Mom kind of freaked me out.


			She means well.

	Still rattled, he takes the stage.  We see the unbridled
	enthusiasm of the faces on the front row.  A wave of cigarette
	lighters stretch out before them.


				
			From Troy, Michigan...

	Russell thwacks a couple chords.  Audience thunders.  He turns
	to other members, feeling chills.  It's in these moments that
	everything else disappears.  They bow and wave, still in
	darkness... each member seems to have his own fans.  Dick lets
	all this play out before finally adding...

					DICK 
			Would you please welcome to Cleveland...

	More applause.  This is very very very very fun.

					DICK 
			Stillwater.

	Lights come up.  A full blast of audience love hits them right
	in the face, as they begin "Fever Dog."  The band charges
	headlong into their set, as various fans are squeezed up out
	of the crowd and onto the stage.



	Who is in the middle of playing, as he smoothly whips off his
	guitar, and uses the instrument to send a Frenetic fan back
	into the crowd.  He slips back under the strap, laughing.
	More stage climbers spring up where that fan came from, and
	Russell now watches as Jeff Bebe dodges a fan and comes over
	to Russell to lean on him.  Russell turns to share the moment
	with Penny, dancing with arms in the air at the side of the
	stage.



	William in the dressing room, eyes red with exhaustion, finally
	interviewing Russell.  He holds the mike stoically.


			So when you play a great show like
			tonight...

	Dick enters with great urgency.


			Okay.  I need everybody's attention.

	The kid shuts his eyes.  He  this would happen.

					DICK 
			Alright, well, the rumors are true.
			The record company has sent a big-time
			manager here to try and talk you into
			replacing me.  His name is Dennis Hope.
			I know you've all heard of him.  He's
			got all the big bands.  He's right
			outside.  He wants five minutes with
			you right now.  I think we gotta do
			it.


				
			Then bring him in.

	William shuts off his tape recorder.


				
			Bring him in!  We'll send him out on a
			rail!


				
			We'll finish on the way to Boston.
			You can fly home from Boston.

	William nods, exhausted, as Dick opens the door.  In walks a
	small general of a man in a baseball t-shirt, well-trimmed
	beard and bowl cut.  He holds the super-new Halliburton
	briefcase.  He is DENNIS HOPE, 25.  A man from the midwest,
	with a vision of the future of rock and roll.  Already in his
	head are all the things that will come to pass.  Higher ticket
	prices.  Merchandising deals.  Greater distribution and
	accounting of album sales.  He shrugs hello to the band.


				
			Hi.


			We already have a manager.  He's been
			with us from the beginning.

	Hope appreciates the lack of small talk.  He strides the room
	with the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort.
	Russell watches, dismissive, holding his guitar.


			Respectfully.  We all have our roots.
			I believe in bands holding onto their
			roots.  But those roots need to be
			augmented.  I'm gonna tell you the truth
			- I may enrage some and enthrall others.
			I don't really give a fuck.   Your
			manager here   Example.
			If you hadn't run out on the contract in
			Phoenix, you  have sued over
			Russell's hand... but you left, negating
			the contract, forfeiting the deposit,
			and you effectively traveled a long
			way to pay that promoter... to
			electrocute you.

	Russell looks at his hand.

					DENNIS HOPE 
			We can all work together.  Your damages
			have put you way into the hole for
			this tour.  Right now you owe the record
			company more than you've got.  But
			your record's selling, there's money
			to be made.  So I've brought a plane
			in, we can add more shows to make-up
			the difference.   


				
			We travel by bus.


			Doris is the soul of this band!  That
			bus has been our home since we were
			the Jeff Bebe Band.

	Dick watches his loyal band with admiration.



			if I thought we'd make more money.
			You can play more dates with a plane...



	Penny Lane stands on stage facing the empty arena.  The roadies
	have packed up and moved on. She is alone in the poetic and
	trash filled structure that was just hours ago filled with
	people.  





	The band meeting continues.


				
			 it's not about the money!  It's
			about Playing music, and turning people
			on!

	The band agrees.


				
			Yes, of course.  Clearly.
			   But on the distasteful
			subject of money.  Just know.  You're
			making it --  --

	He gestures to infinity.

					DENNIS HOPE 
			-- out   I'm just talking about
			bringing it --

	Bringing his hand together in a fist, he returns it, close to
	his heart.

					DENNIS HOPE 
			-- back 

	The band looks at Dick, who manages not to be speechless.


 for something
			we can do ourselves?


				
			Do you know how to keep from getting
			charged for the ice below the
			floorboards of Chicago Stadium?
			Do you  how to do a headlining
			tour, do you Claire Rothman at the
			L.A. Forum?  Do you know Bobbi Cowan,
			Lisa Robinson, Jim Ladd, Frank
			Barcelona?
				
			This is Cleveland. Where's 
				
			Do you know how you get a record not
			pressed but   Do you know?  I
			didn't invent the rainy day, man.  I
			just own the best umbrella.

	He laughs.  It's fun.  Band members are now listening, curiously
	spellbound.

					DENNIS HOPE 
			Because as much as you may believe that
			it will last forever, it does  last
			forever... your  fan right now
			soon they're going to go to college,
			gonna wanna buy clothes, spend that money
			some other way, and you know what?
				
			They'll tape your record from a friend's
			copy.

	Russell stops fingering his guitar.  Shot moves across the
	faces of the band members.  Pain.

					DENNIS HOPE 
			You've got to take what you can, when you
			can,  you can.  And you've got to do
			it .  That's what the big boys do.

	The band squirms, but listens.

					DENNIS HOPE 
			Because if you think Mick Jagger will
			still be out there trying to be a rock
			star at age fifty, you're sadly sadly
			mistaken.

	Now he's reaching them.  Their slackened roar-weary faces stare
	back at the young dynamo.


				
			Yeah, well... we'll think about what
			you said.


				
			No no.  You don't understand.  
			think about it.  I'm not auditioning.
			I came here to decide whether I want
			to represent   So I'll stand outside
			for a moment, and think about whether
			 want to stay.

	He leaves the room with a pleasant shrug.  Stunned silence.
	William watches their body language.  No one wants to talk
	first.  Their faces read as -- who was that guy, and how can
	we talk him into staying?



	William watches as the band stands inside the new plane.  Dennis
	Hope looks on.




	He looks around for support.  Grim nodding faces.

					RUSSELL 
				
			This is too much.

	William watches as Russell reclines.  Russell grabs Penny, and
	she falls into the seat next to him.   We hear the loud oncoming
	sound of the plane in flight, as Dennis cooly asks for Penny's
	seat.


			Do you mind?



	Doris the bus stays behind in the parking lot, abandoned near
	a field.  The new plane lifts off in the background, as the
	bus sits alone, as if crying steel tears.  Bus Banner reads
	simply: CLEVELAND.  Reprise ending of Whole Lotta Love.



	The girls sit on the jumper seats at the back of the plane,
	with William.



	William trudges the hallway with tape-recorder and notebook,
	trolling for Russell.   He passes Boston travelogue posters on
	the walls.  A few room doors are open, he looks for any sign
	of the guitarist.   William veers into Dick's room, where a
	poker game full of Roadies is in progress.  The room is thick
	with exotic smoke.   They are a bunch of road-hardened snobs,
	smoking cigars and other items, famous to themselves, listening
	not to rock and roll... but Sarah Vaughn.


			Anyone seen Russell?


			The Enemy!

	Door widens to reveal Russell.


			Hey!  Welcome to the Road Crew Poker
			Party.  This game's been going of for
			two years.


			That's Mick - he's with The Who.  That's
			John - with J. Geils.  And that's
			Richard with the Eagles... and you know
			The Wheel.


			Hey.

	Grumbling roadies continue playing.  Like an old pro, the kid
	turns down a Cola-can hash-pipe.  This hand is down to Dick,
	and a roadie named REG from Humble Pie.


			Side proposition.  For fifty dollars
			and a case of Heineken, I will put
			into the pot... three Lovely Ladies,
			Including the famous Penny Lane... the
			Band-Aids, who need to exit our tour
			before New York...


			It's a deal.  Show 'em.

	Dick lays down three tens.  Reg lays down three Kings.  Dick
	loses.


			Three Lovely Ladies... now in the
			custody of Humble Pie.


			Alright, so we owe you fifty dollars
			and a case of Heineken.

	Embarrassed, Russell notices the kids face.  He leans over,
	and speaks confidentially to him.


			Look.  Nobody's feelings are getting
			hurt here.  She already knows Leslie's
			coming To New York tomorrow.  They all
			understand.  This is the Circus.
			Everybody's trying not to go home.
			Nobody's saying 


			No, I got it.


			These are the Rules that come with
			every electric Guitar and every
			amplifier.  They're not just 
			anywhere.  Rock and roll, brother.  No
			attachments.  No boundaries.

	But the kid feels bad, and Russell knows it.

					RUSSELL 
			Quit looking at me like that.



	The kid is still stuck on the road.  He is in  now.
	Wearily, with deep circles under his eyes, he shuts his eyes
	for a moment.  Another band is moving through.


			Keep this hallway clear!



	William and Penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker-room
	bench.  It's a small dressing room, crowded with roadies,
	guitars and men in stages of half-dress.  Piles of luggage
	headed for New York sit by the door.  The door suddenly opens
	and Dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a
	sparkler.  It is placed in Penny's lap. It reads: Unforgettable
	Penny... Age Unknown.  Boston, 1973.   They gather now as the
	cake sits before a surprised and enchanted Penny Lane.


			Happy Birthday from us.

	William watches her face as she reads the message on the cake.
	It hasn't sunk in yet.

	Russell produces a piece of hotel stationery.  He reads a poem.


			So Penny our friend has gained another year.
			But long ago, she threw it in gear.
			She rocked the south
			The East and West.
			Could you please get off this endless tour
			Where we're Black Sabbath's fucking
			 special guest?

	Laughter.

					RUSSELL 
			She says she's retired
			Though we've heard that before.
			She chose us...
			And in Penny Lane we trust
			She is a fan of this band.
			Much more so than us.

	William watches her face.  Still enchanted, she hands out slices
	of the cake.


				
			Sorry the plane isn't bigger.

	It hits her.  She looks at William for a clue.  His truthful
	face does not look away.  Now she knows.  She turns to the
	others --   Shot moves in on Penny as
	she blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mugging
	for everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy
	laughter.  Shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning to
	connect with band members.  Each of them look away, nobody
	maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesn't
	look at.  William.  She blows out the candles, vamping Marilyn
	Monroe-style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to cheers.
	Russell watches, as we push in on Penny.  She notices all the
	luggage is gone, only her two cases remain by the door.



	William exits a backstage Portosan.  Penny catches him by the
	grilling area where catering is preparing for the outdoor event.
	Their laminated passes swing from around their necks.  Thuding
	in the distance, Stillwater plays for a cheering outdoor crowd.
	The sound of summer insects in the air.


			So it wasn't a birthday party, it was
			a farewell.

	William doesn't answer.  He looks at her, blowing some hair
	out of her face.

					PENNY 
			You think you can fool me.  I read
			you.  I know what you're thinking.


			What's that?


				
			You're  about me and Russell.


			Yeah.  I gotta work on that.


			You're so sweet.  God -- if there was
			more of you in 


			Don't tell me this stuff.  I want to
			like him.


				
			Did you miss your test or something?

	He shakes his head.  It's so beyond a test.

					PENNY 
			I know I'm not on the plane, and I'm
			not going on   I
			mean, I could go with the Sabbath road
			crew, but that would be pathetic.  The
			girls are all going with Humble Pie.
			If you could find out from Russell --


				
			Penny -


				
			Forget it.  I'm flying to New York
			myself.  I have a bunch of partial
			tickets.  I know his ex-wife, current
			girlfriend's going to be there -

	William's eyebrows rise.  She examines his face for clues.


			-- I'm not sure that's a good idea.


				
			What?  What are you saying?  What do
			you know?  Did Russell say something?


			I don't know anything.


			I know he wants me there.  He gave me
			a cake.  He wrote me that sweet poem.


				
			Wake up!  Don't go to New York!


			What are you telling me?

	She looks so achingly beautiful to him.


			Because you're not who you said you
			were!  I thought you were 


			You're right.  I'm not who I said I
			was.  I'm just like you. I love music,
			so this is my family.  Some people
			like tractors, and they hang out with
			  What's the worst that
			could happen if I go to New York?
				
			"I get my little heart broken?"


  You eat people
			

	She tears some leaves off a tree.  He looks at her, unable to
	formulate a response.


				
			I'm sorry I told you so much.   You
			have some way of making everybody tell
			you all their secrets.


			That's a good one.  Tell me too much
			and make it  fault.

	He continues walking, she follows.  They have ventured outside
	the backstage area, onto adjoining Boston farmland.  The show
	booms in the background.


			Come on.  You've seen what's happened.
			Russell and I fell in love.  How much,
			I don't know... but this is the first
			time I've fallen for someone, really
			fallen... since Iggy, and I'm not happy
			about it.


				
			You slept with 

	She says nothing.

					WILLIAM 
				
			Why don't you just tell me now, who
			else -- so when I go to the record
			store, I know who to be jealous of.
			Because right now, it's looking like
			

	He's upset.   She stares at him.


				
			You'll remember me forever.  I was
			there when you lost your virginity.


				
			So was Steely Dan!  It was a crowded
			room.

	She laughs, can't help it.  Then:


			You make me laugh.  I think I'm gonna
			cry.


				
			I thought we were going to Morocco!
			There's no Morocco.  There's never 
			a Morocco.  There's not even a Penny
			Lane.  I don'teven know your real
			name.


			If I ever met a guy in the real world,
			who looked at me the way you just looked
			at me...


			When and where does the real world
			occur?  I am really... confused here.
			Fuck!  All these Rules And all these
			sayings... and nicknames...


			You know -- you're too sweet for rock
			and roll.


			Where do you get off... where do you
			get "sweet?"  I'm not sweet.  I'm dark
			and mysterious and pissed-off and I
			could be very dangerous to all of you...
			I'm not sweet, and you should know
			that about me!  I am The Enemy.


			You're not any of those things and
			that's what I love about you.

	William stands there in disbelief, unable to look at her.


 from falling
			in love.


			I don't want to go home!


And you never
			helped me.


			Yes I did.


			That disc-jockey in Arizona got a better
			interview than me... and he was 

	He starts walking back to the stage.  She follows.  They are
	two very young kids thrashed by the seas of rock and roll.
	His frustration increases.  She just doesn't get it.  Applause
	in b.g.  She grabs his shirt.


			Look.  You should be happy for me.
			You don't know what he says to me in
			private.  Maybe it  love.  As much
			as it can be with someone who --


				
			-- sold you to Humble Pie for fifty
			dollars and a case of beer?  I was
			there!

	He is instantly sorry.  Her world privately crumbles, but she
	tries to remain stoic and carefree.


			What kind of beer?



	Sapphire, Polexia, and Estrella bump along to the music and
	the road.  They strain to maintain dignity in these decidedly
	third-class surroundings.  There's only one small blurry window.


			Who did this to us?



	Mom on the phone.


			Then don't come home.  Don't do this
			to me.  If you're going to miss
			graduation, don't come home.

	She hangs up.



	William on the phone.   Speechless.



	Elaine faces her Humanities class.  She stands in an
	amphitheater-style, inner-city college classroom, decorated
	with colorful unorthodox artifacts from her home.  These earnest
	city college students listen to her.  But she cannot continue.
	There is a thundering upset inside her.


			I'm sorry.  I can't concentrate.
				
			Rock stars kidnaped my son.



	Music.  Russell and band bounces down in NYC.  Russell listens
	to music on headphones plugged into large boom box.



	William watches, facing the band from the jump seat of their
	limousine, heading into New York.  Up ahead, Manhattan looms,
	beautiful and scary.


			"New York.  Just like I pictured it...



			" ... skyscrapers and everything."


				
			We showed you America.  We did
			everything but get you laid.

	Beat.  They look at each other curiously.  How much does the
	other guy know?



	Russell and band spill out of limo.  The New York cluster of
	hardcore Stillwater fans wait outside.  They hold collector's
	sleeves covering albums to be autographed, and fresh magic
	markers in hand.  William in tow crawls out of the limo last.
	Dick goes to work, pulling luggage from the trunk.  A serious-
	looking Fan  approaches Russell with an autograph card.


			I'm from the Church of Lenny.   We bow
			to his will and all that it represents
			- The King of the King of Kings.


			Make it out to - ?




	Russell nods -- of course.  He signs, as Dick approaches with
	a well-placed word in his right ear.


			She's here.

	William turns, expecting to see Penny.  Instead we see the
	long-limbed, athletic, pretty and collegiate LESLIE.    She
	holds a Nikon camera, and snaps their picture.


			Leslie!


			Your room is completely stocked, far
			away from any noisy ice machines,
			elevators or maid quarters.  The air-
			conditioning is already on.  And here
			is your security key -- by the way,
			you look stunning.


				(taking treatment for
			granted)
			ThanksI'llseeyoulater.

	Nearby, the young journalist studies the tour's subtle shift
	in welcoming Leslie.   Dick's New York side is almost military.


			Bags in five!  Cars leave for the party
			at six!

	William studies Leslie, everyone saying hello to her, everyone
	knowing the subtext.  Nobody saying a word.  William pulls his
	heavy bag out of the back of the limousine.
	The bag breaks, and the contents spill out onto the New York
	sidewalk.  Bars of soap, ashtrays, hotel keys, crumpled paper,
	the contraband t-shirt, "Do Not Disturb" signs, notes, towels
	and thick telephone books from every city.

					DICK 
			You know.  There are lighter souvenirs.


				
			Well -- I kept thinking I was going
			home the next day --


			I did too.  Fifteen years ago.

	All help him with his spilled souvenirs.  Russell shares a
	private look with the kid.  Nearby Leslie greets other band
	members.


			Ric!

	It's Super Zeppelin fan Ric Nunez.


				
			It's all happening.  Zeppelin is at
			the Plaza.  So's four other bands.
			They're partying up there right now.
			Sapphire, and Miss Penny Lane too...
			She wants you to call her.
				
			They're all staying under the name
			Emily Rugburn.

	William takes in the information, while regarding Ric's new
	custom  shirt, which features the words to Zeppelin's "The Rain
	Song."


				
			After the party.  I'll come to your
			room - I promise.  We'll talk.  This
			is Leslie, by the way.  Leslie, this
			is our wayward friend from Rolling
			Stone.  The Enemy.

	They shake, she smiles randomly.



	William checks in.


			William Miller?  Sir, you have an urgent
			call from a Mr. "Ben Fong-Torres."
			He's holding for you, right now.

	William takes the phone.  The Clerk watches curiously as the
	kid adopts a new persona.


				
			Hello.





	On a rainy day in San Francisco, Ben Fong-Torres stands in the
	copy-strewn office of the young editor/publisher JANN WENNER.
	Several other editors are also present in the background,
	including David Felton with cigarette-holder in mouth, and a
	prep-school Fact-Checker named ALLISON.


			Congratulations.  It's gonna be a cover.
			Neal Preston will shoot 'em next week
			in L.A.  we need you back in San
			Francisco tomorrow.  We'll finish the
			story here.

	William is overwhelmed with many emotions, fear topping the
	list.

					BEN 
			You can tell the band.  Allison, our
			fact checker, needs you to transmit
			whatever you have of the story, tonight,
			now, along with your notes.  There is
			a mojo at the  they'll let
			us use -


			Mojo?


 machine
			that transmits pages over the telephone.
			It only takes eighteen Minutes a page...



	The sound of feet on pavement.  William looks at addresses,
	hustling to the  office.



	William tears pages from his notebook and feeds them into the
	large and clunky earliest model fax machine -- "The Mojo."  We
	hear David Bowie.  "The Jean Genie."



	William weaves, exhausted, into the Stillwater press party at
	this legendary New York nightspot.  The Doorman, who checks
	i.d.s, sees the kid and expresses great doubt.


			He's okay, he's with us -

	Hope shoves him past the Guard, and sends him into a very mature
	new world.



	The famous hub of New York rock and roll.  A strong whiff of
	decadence mixes with youthful naivete.  Not a hippie in sight.
	William walks through, looking for familiar faces.  Overhead
	we hear Stillwater.  "If You Say Nothing."  The party is filled
	with scenesters, long silver-haired glamsters, some British
	journalists, and many hunched young skinny bodies in leather
	jackets.  Russell grabs him by the arm.


			Ah ha!  There you are, ya little fucker.
			Come on --


			I have some good news.


			-- I'll piss to that.  Follow me.



	They enter the small bathroom.  Russell bolts the door, faces
	the urinal and pees.  His own music throbs in the next room.


			Dennis Hope took me aside, and wants
			to manage Me solo.  Says to lose the
			band by February.  Should I do it?  I
			have no perspective anymore.

	William pees in silence.

					RUSSELL 
			At what point do I just take the hint?
			Nobody Loves this band.  People like
			us, do they love us?


			I do.


				
			Oh - get this - somebody told Penny
			Lane I sold her for beer.  The network
			of these chicks!  Like I would do that.
			It's Jeff who told her, right?  Not
			you, right?  None of these guys can
			just calm down and be a fuckin 
			Now she's here, freaking out.  Leslie
			can smell it.


				
			Wait.  I've got something to tell -

	But he finds himself trailing Russell to the back room bar.



	Leslie in the bathroom.  Penny enters and watches her
	discreetly.  They stand together, side-by-side at the mirror.
	Leslie looks once, turns and then turns back at Penny.  She
	knows.



	William sits with the band.  Over Jeff's head, Penny hangs
	nearby, at the outskirts, drinking and dancing.  They share a
	look, feigning casualty.


			You guys -- you guys --
				
			You're gonna be on the cover of Rolling
			Stone.

	Stunned and overwhelmed, the band waits a beat, lets it sink
	in... and goes wild.  Russell, stunned too, looks at the kid.
	It's big news.  Jeff stands immediately, eyes moist, glass
	raised.


				
			The cover of   And we
			made it together.  They don't just put
			somebody with  on the
			cover of Rolling Stone Fucking Magazine,
			man.  We made it.

	The band nods solemnly, importantly.

					JEFF 
				
			Damn it -- I'm gonna enjoy this.  The
			first time I bought that magazine The
			Beatles were on the cover.  Four of
			them.    Together.
			

	They begin singing the then-current Dr. Hook and the Medicine
	Show hit, "The Cover of the Rolling Stone" to William.


			Who is that girl?  She's creeping me
			out.  She's not with any of you, is
			she?


			She's with me.

	And now Leslie has confirmation.  A symphony of looks, as Dick
	gets to his feet and moves to confront Penny.  Penny Lane's
	eyes fill and she runs out.  Russell stands... and sees William
	also stand.  William turns and follows her.  Russell stands
	watching, and does not leave.   We hear Elton John's  "Mona
	Lisas and Mad Hatters."



	William exits as a crush of Partygoers arrives.  He doesn't
	know where she is.   He takes off to examine the cabs stuck in
	traffic.  Song continues.



	He looks in the backs of cabs.   None of them her.

	Music continues.  He runs down the streets, looking for her.
	Alone in New York City.



	William on the house phone.


			Emily Rugburn, please.



	William approaches Suite 702.  The door is open.  He hears new
	band voices, and sees new faces. MUSICIAN  # 1 intercepts him.


			Hi.  I'm a friend of Penny Lane's.


			Aren't we all -

	Musician types are leaving.


			Where is she?

	Room Service arrives.  Some appetizers and a large expensive
	bottle of champagne on ice.


			Can somebody sign for this?

	William does.

					ROOM SERVICE GUY 
			Thank you Mr. Rugburn.

	Two more Musicans  exit the back room party.  The
	room is clearing out.


			She's sick.  Let's get out of here.


			She used to be so much more together.

	William watches all, champagne in hand, and finds her in the
	backroom.  She's addled and nearly passed out.


			What happened?


			I'm not good at goodbyes.

	She sags.  He grabs the phone.

					PENNY LANE 
			You're the last of my old-time friends.
			Polexia went to England with Deep
			Purple... can you believe that?  Even
			Sapphire's out someplace else.  All
			she left was her quaaludes.



				
			Front desk?  Please send a doctor.
			Room... what room?  703.     Both
			rooms, either room.  This is Mr. Rugburn,
			Yes.  My wife's had an accident with
			some quaaludes.  Yes - I'll do that.

	The room has emptied out.  Just them, and the remnants of a
	movable party that has moved elsewhere.

					WILLIAM 
			Wake up!

	He struggles to get her on her feet.  She tips over on her
	strappy platform shoes.  He struggles to untie them.



	The School band plays "Colour My World."  School PRINCIPAL at
	the podium.


			And now... out graduating class!  Jane
			

	A peppy student bounds up and grabs her diploma.   Elaine Miller
	watches dolefully in the audience.



	William holds Penny in his arms.  Finally she is close to him.




			Victor Sanchez!

	Warm applause for another student who grabs his diploma.  He
	takes off his mortar board to flash an American flag bandana.
	He raises his diploma in victory.



	William holds Penny Lane, and keeps her moving.  It's a sagging,
	messy slow dance.


			"In the unlikely event of a water
			landing... "


			"... you will be required to wear a
			safety vest."


			Keep going.

			the overhead compartments... out in the

			"Seat and tray tables."

			be in their full and upright and 
			positions... "





				
			William Miller... not present.

	Elaine applauds her son, stoically.  It is a dagger through
	her heart.  A sympathetic look from a nearby Mother continues
	the pain.



	They move slowly, she's fading.


			"In the tragic event of a water
			landing..."



	The Principal shares a few thoughts:


			And to the class of 1973, we say --
				
			Don't forget to remember yourself as
			you are   Full of hope... and
			the dream that everything is possible...
			Remember this, twenty years from now,
			when we all own home computers and we
			all travel in shiny electrical cars
			that move  high above the
			city...
				
			They key to the future is keeping today
			alive 

	Elaine's head lowers slowly in a sea of happy parents.  The
	day will never end.  Mrs. Deegan slips into the seat next to
	her.


			First.  Release the guilt.
				
			Second -


			Please let there be only two, because
			I can't get past Number One.


			Second.  Leave a little room for the
			other teachers in this world.  He's
			out there looking for mentors.


			He's got twelve of them.  They're lined
			up.  He's just tired of 



	William holds Penny.  She is very woozy.


			"... you will be required to..."
				
			I'm tired.

	She is very groggy, as he holds her.


			Well.  Now that I have your attention.
			And you may not remember this later, I
			just want to make it clear that... 
				(she blinks, barely awake
			again)
			I know you've heard this before.  And
			I have never said this to anybody, not
			really - well, nobody who didn't legally
			have to say it back to me, but -
				
			I love you.  And I have a hard time
			sharing you with all of rock and roll
			because I - why am I nervous? - You'll
			never remember this - HEY! -
				
			I love you, and I'm about to boldly go
			where...   men have gone before...

	He kisses her.  A doctor and nurse come crashing into the room.
	They push past William and pull Penny into the bathroom.  He
	sits on the edge of the bed, looking into the bathroom, as
	they work on her.  We hear Stevie Wonder.  "My Cherie Amor."



	Doctor places a tube down Penny Lane's throat.  A bored nurse
	holds a water-bag, lowering it to ground level.



	Her feet sticking out, wriggling.  He watches, as music
	continues.



	Her amber-colored stomach contents look like a Jackson Pollack
	portrait of the era, with three partially dissolved pills.
	Doctor hands enter frame and remove them.  Music continues.



	The Doctor re-appears, and sits down next to William, as the
	Nurse exits.  The Doctor withdraws a three-page report form.


			Your wife will be okay for now -


			Thank you Doctor.


			However, she says you're her brother.


				
			She's a little confused.

	The ice shifts in the champagne bucket nearby.  The Doctor
	sizes up the situation.


			Nice champagne.


			I don't have a driver's license.  With
			me.


			Tomorrow's my wedding anniversary.
			I'd prefer to take care of this without
			facing the dawn at the police station.
			So if you can find a way to get this
			girl - your wife - back home to her
			parents, I'd let you pay me anything
			you can afford.  Because you don't
			appear to be related to the famous
			Rugburns of Rhode Island.

	His eyes flick to the champagne.  The kid takes a hint, reaches
	over to the champagne.


			Happy Anniversary.

	The Doctor puts the champagne in his bag.


			She won't be good company, but keep
			her awake for another four hours.



	Song continues.  William and Penny drag themselves through the
	airport.  He guides her to the ticket counter.  Penny wears
	her green coat, large sunglasses.  He sorts through her many
	partial tickets.  They are both so tired.  She shakes off her
	coat -- she's suddenly very hot -- and he grabs it and loops
	it through her bags.  She's irritable, and ready to go home.




				
			When I was 14, my Mom and her boyfriend
			took me to a Rolling Stones concert -
			and I freaked out and I rushed up to
			the front of the stage and then a
			thousand people had the same idea at
			the same time and I was getting crushed.
			And I couldn't breathe and that thought
			flashed through me - almost like a car
			accident - I thought I might die.  And
			it was in the middle of "Midnight
			Rambler" and Keith Richards saw me.
			And he came over, and came to the front
			of the stage, and he pulled me out.
			And they took me backstage and they
			gave me coke with ice and a - and a
			lemon.  And I never went home.


			What about your Mom?


			She always said - "Marry Up." Marry
			someone   That's why she named
			me Lady.


				
			She named you 


			Lady Goodman.


			No.


			You never really get used to it, either.


			Well -- this -- this just explains
			

	He wishes it did.  She rubs her stomach.  It's a rocky morning.

					WILLIAM 
			See you back in the real world.


			See you back there.

	She kisses his forehead, and takes off down the accordian
	leading to her plane.  She drops her coat again, bending down
	to retrieve it.


			Hey Lady!

	Four Woman turn, but not Penny.  She disappears.



	Penny Lane settles into her seat on the airplane.  She notices
	William watching from the terminal window, and waves.


			Please extinguish all flammable items,
			and return all seats and tray tables to
			their full and upright locked positions.

	She mouths along with the words.  There is no one to share the
	joke with.  And then a few blurry memories come back to her.
	She gestures to him... understanding him more fully... as he
	disappears.



	William walks alongside her plane, moving from terminal window
	to terminal window.  Catching her glance again, he's picking
	up steam.  What's she saying?



	She keeps watching as he runs alongside, still keeping up with
	her plane.  She now fully remembers, and places her outstretched
	fingers on the window.  She mouths the words:   I'll see you
	back home!



	He us running through her fingers.



	Who can run no further.







	Russell and William are in mid-interview.  The kid's microphone
	is out.  It's a little bit of a rough flight.  William wears
	the same clothes.


			Why didn't you come back to the party?
			Bob Dylan showed up.  He was sitting
			at our table for... had to be an hour,
			right?  Just    Bob Dylan!  I
			kept looking for you.  I was going to
			introduce you.

	The kid feels pain.


			What happened to you last night?


			It's a log story.

	A sharp jolt of turbulence.  Russell begins pounding on the
	card table in rhythm.


				
			"Peggy Sure... Peggy Sue... "


			Please.


			"Pretty pretty pretty pretty Peggy
			Sue... "

	A moment of laughter, and then   Jeff's drink rises and
	suspends briefly in mid-air.  The plane takes another mighty
	knock.


			We shouldn't be here.


			Doris, we miss you!

	Fear is creeping in around the edges.  William, already an
	uneasy flier, looks down.


			This is Craig, your pilot.  It appears
			we've caught the edge of that electrical
			storm we were trying to outrun.  Buckle
			up tight now.  We're gonna do our best
			to getcha out of this.

	The rocking of the plane worsens, as all buckle up.


			"Electrical storm?"


				(strapping in for a roller
			coaster)
			Rock and roll.

	The sky darkens abruptly. William looks up, increasingly
	nervous, stares straight ahead.  The plane suddenly drops and
	stabilizes.  Everyone is silent but Russell.

					RUSSELL 
			Wooooooo Baby!

	A moment later, an ashen-faced CO-PILOT emerges, balancing
	himself with hands on the ceiling of the shuddering plane.


			We're gonna try to land in Tupelo.
			We're going to have to cut the inside
			lighting for the next several minutes.
			We found a field to land in.

	The kid notices Silent Ed is rubbing a small crucifix.





			I can't breathe.

	Push in on Russell. We hear a series of unfamiliar electrical
	sounds.  The plane screwballs through the sky.


			It might be a rough set-down.  We should
			be fine.
				
			But what we do say in a situation like
			this is - We would pass but before the
			plane ... disassembled.  However, God
			help us, if there's anything you want
			to say to each other, any secrets,
			anything like that, now would be a
			good time.  But just hang in there.
			We'll get you out of this.

	He returns to the cockpit.  The weather worsens, as the hail
	suddenly pelts the plane, and it comes down hard.  Inside lights
	shut off.   William stares straight ahead, as the cockpit door
	swings open - total chaos visible inside - and then shuts again.


			And everyone thinks it's so glamorous
			out here.


				
			He just told us we're gonna die.


				
			We're gonna crash in Elvis' hometown --


			Shut up.


 in an original
			city!


			C'mon Dennis, get us a better city.

	Nervous laughter.  Another sheet of hail hits the plane.


			Oh my God.



	Just shaking.  Nearly in tears.   Hyperventilating.


			If something should happen.  I love
			all of you.  I don't think we have to
			do the secrets thing.

	The plane shakes.  Now lightening strikes very close.  A
	flashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and
	evaporates with a burning smell still in the air.  In the
	darkness:


			I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
			A hit-and-run.  I hit him and kept on
			going.  I don't know if he's alive or
			dead, but I'm sorry.


				
			

	The plane wildly rises, and falls.  It stops for a moment.  A
	strange smooth patch.


			I love you all too, and you're my
			family.  Especially since Marna left
			me.  But if I ever took an extra dollar
			or two, here and there, it was because
			I knew I'd earned it.


 with Marna, Dick.


			I did too.


			I waited until you broke up with her.
			But me too.


			I also slept with Leslie, when you
			were fighting.


			You... slept with Jeff?


			Yes, but it didn't count.  It was the
			summer we decided to be free of all
			rules.


				
			And you say you "love me."


				
			I don't love you, man.  I never did.


			Please.  Enough.


			NONE of us love you.  You act above
			us.  You ALWAYS HAVE!!


			Finally.  The truth.


			You just held it over us, like you
			light leave... like we're lucky to be
			with you.
			I had to live with you, and now I might
			die with you and it's 

	William watches, catatonic.


				
			You hate me?  

	Larry stares at him.  Ed says nothing.

					RUSSELL 
			All this 
				
			And you don't even  me.


			And I'm still in love with you Leslie.

	Bam.  The plane is pulling sideways, and dropping altitude.


			I don't want to hear anymore.    Shut
			up! Shut up!  


				
			


			Don't be self-righteous, Russell, not
			now.  You were sleeping with Penny,
			that groupie.  Last summer, and up
			until   Why don't you tell
			Leslie THAT?

	Russell tries to get up and attack him.  The force keeps him
	in his seat.  He yells.  Loud.


				
			I quit.

	The turbulence worsens.  William finds his mouth saying
	emotional words he cannot control.



			All she did was love your band.  And
			you all -- you used her, 
			You used her and threw her away.  She
			almost died last night, while you were
			with   You're always talking
			about the fans, the fans, the fans.
			She was your  and you threw
			her away.  And if you can't see that,
			 your biggest problem.

	Russell and Jeff stare at each other.   The plane is rocking
	very very hard.  Leslie is crying.


			I'm gay.

	They all turn to the silent drummer.  (It's his first spoken
	dialogue of the movie.)

	Then.

	The plane pops out from below the clouds.  Sunshine spikes
	through the embattled windows of the plane, as they float
	downwards to the city of Tupelo, Mississippi.  A very very
	uneasy silence fills the plane.  No one can look at each other.
	Out bursts the Co-Pilot, giddy with victory.


			Thank God above, WE'RE ALIVE!!   WE'RE


	Shot of all the occupants, ending with Russell.  Suddenly, the
	alternative seems far more attractive.  We hear Rod Stewart's
	"Jo's Lament" as music plays over their still-shocked faces.



	Music continues, as they walk together like ghosts in a long
	and very pregnant silence, ignoring the kid.  Everything is
	different now.  The kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster.
	We continue with the band, unhappily moving forward.  William
	hustles back to catch up.  They ignore him.  There are much
	bigger thoughts in play.  No one wants to speak.


			Well, I think we can build on this new
			honesty.

	Boom.  Russell attacks him, and they're pulled apart.  The
	band continues moving forward, arriving at a fork in the airport
	terminals.  William stops.  This is where he must part company.
	He stands at the mouth of the next terminal, as the band
	continues, unaware he's split off.   He watches their backs,
	they've forgotten him.

	Then Russell turns, sensing something missing.  William.  All
	now stop and turn.  Still shell-shocked, they summon a pre-
	occupied but heartfelt goodbye.  William waves.  Music
	continues.



	William's finger finds San Francisco.



	The kid checks the address as he arrives at the MJB Building,
	and its next-door neighbor, the San Francisco headquarters of
	 Magazine.  He still wears the same clothes from
	last night in New York.



	William arrives at the front desk, gets the once-over from  a
	friendly RECEPTIONIST, a paragon of new cool.


			Leave your package at the desk.


			I'm not a messenger.  I'm one of your
			writers.  William Miller.

	He is zombie-tired, with heavy duffel case and his orange bag.



	William walks down the center aisle.  Editors and writers look
	at him, standing at the front of their cubicles to see this
	exhausted 15 year-old writer.  At the end of the aisle, like a
	human finish line, stand Ben Fong-Torres.


			You're William Miller?

	The secret emerges not with a bang but with a slight and tired
	nod of the head.


			Yep.


				
			Oh baby.

	Ben leads him into the office of Jann Wenner, the editor-
	publisher.



	William sits.  Editors are feverishly discussing the next issue.
	The big concerns of a national magazine are in the air.
	Everyone is focused and quick.  The conversation is machine-
	gun like. Jann Werner turns to the kid.


			We can't run this piece.

	The kid's eyes travel to his story -- a stack of fuzzy-looking
	sheets on the table.


			You obviously saw more than you wrote
			about.  After eight days on the road
			with these guys.


 happen?


 in this piece?  What
			did  want to write?  Because this
			reads like what  wanted you to
			write.


			What happened to your highly-touted
			think piece on limitations of a middle-
			level Band in the face of success?

	William sits speechless.  It's sinking in.  Failure.
	Conversation continues at a fast pace:


			We can push up Chet's Who cover -


			Good 'cause it's going to take me three
			days to get through this research.
			It's all handwritten, on little slips.
			Plus, they all refer to woman as
			"chicks." I mean, as a woman I have a
			problem with that.  I know it's a side
			issue.


				
			It's a "puff piece."  you fell for
			'em.  It happens.  A relationship forms.
			You want them to like you.
				(wistful, chewing cigarette
			holder)
			Happened with me and Charlie Manson.
			He was a very charming... lively...
			

	Felton catches himself swooning.  The other are staring at
	him.  He snaps out of it.

					DAVID FELTON 
			... mass-murderer.


			Please let me finish it.  Give me
			tonight to work on it.


			Chet's piece is all fact-checked and
			ready.


				
			Get some sleep.  We'll do another story
			sometime.  We'll get you a kill fee.


little bits of
			paper.  Did I say that?



			It's not finished.


			That's being charitable.

	Ben looks at the kid, then at Jann.  Jann scans the kid's face
	for a beat, nods.


			Let him use the big office.   It's
			where Hunter used to write.

	William rises, gratefully.  He shakes Jann's hand.


				
			You can type.






	William sits in the "big" office.  It's a small white tank.
	After all the sound and fury, there is only the hum of a large
	electric typewriter.  His research, transcripts and some band
	photos sit nearby.  He takes a bite of a candy bar, a sip of
	coffee.  He looks at the phone.



	Crazy jazz is playing.  Lester Bangs on the phone.



			See, friendship is the  they feed
			you.  They want you to get drunk on
			feeling like you 





	William in the empty  office.


				
			Well, it was fun.


			They make you feel cool.  And hey.  I
			met you.  You are  "cool."


			I know.  Even when I though I was, I
			knew I wasn't.


			That's because we are uncool!  And
			while women will always be a problem for
			guys like us, most of the great   art in
			the world is about that  problem.
			Good-looking people have no spine!
			Their art never lasts!  They  get the
			girls, but we're 


			I can really see that now.


			Yeah, great art is about conflict and
			pain and guilt and longing and love
			disguised as sex, and sex disguised as
			love... and let's face it, you got a
			big head start.


			I'm glad you were home.





			Me too!


				
			The only true currency in this bankrupt
			world if what we share with someone
			else when we're 


				
			I feel better


			My advice to you.  I know you think
			those guys are your friends.  You want
			to be a true friend to them?

	William takes a deep breath.  Looks at the research cassettes and
	notebooks.  The empty page.



				
			You're doing great.  Call me later is
			you want.  I'm always up.



	Ben Fong-Torres and David Felton look at William's new
	manuscript with great interest.


			Read me the opening line.


				
			"I am flying high over Tupelo,
			Mississippi, with America's hottest
			band, and we are all about to die."


			Mmmmm.
				
			Dark.  


			Yeah, and it gets better.
				
			Did this all really happen?

	William sleeps restlessly nearby, mouth agape, sitting upright
	in a plastic chair.


				(jealously reaches for
			manuscript)
			Give it to me.  I'll call and check
			the quotes.



	The band rides in a new tour bus.  The palpable tone in the
	air is -- PANIC.


			Look.  Let's just piece together our
			information...  because the fact-checker
			asked us all about different parts of
			the story.


			What did he write about?  What's he
			using?


  He's using it all.


			So what?


			So what?
				
			We come off like amateurs... some
			average band...  trying to come to
			grips, jealous and fighting and breaking
			up - we're 


			Maybe we just don't see ourselves the
			way we really are.


			He was supposed to be our friend.


				
			I told him to write what he wanted.

	All eyes look to Russell.


				
			By the way, he has you on acid,
			screaming "I Am A Golden God" from a
			fan's rooftop.


				
			Oh my God.


			They used him to fuck us.


				(still back at "Golden
			God")
			I didn't say "Golden God."  Or did I?


			We never took him seriously, and now
			it's serious.


			I liked him as a person.


			He was never a "person!"  He was a
			journalist!

	Russell nods.  He looks at Silent Ed, drumming soundlessly on
	a rubber pad.


			You.  You had the right idea all along.

	Ed silently nods thanks.


				
			How about the plane flight?


			It's all in there.  But don't worry,
			it's all unspecific who say what.  No
			names are mentioned in the more
			embarrassing sequences, it's just
			completely obvious who's who!  We're
			fucked!

	Silence.


			I forgot he was there.


			Well, they haven't talked to Russell -
			he can always deny the key stuff to
			the fact checker.  Then they can't
			print it.


				
			Is that true?


			It's war, my friend.  If you'd met me
			earlier, he would have never been on the
			around.

	Dennis hands Russell the phone.

					DENNIS HOPE 
			He'll live.



	William is still being congratulated by his new peers.  We see
	him woozy but beaming, as Allison the Fact Checker comes out
	of her office, waving the manuscript.  She works her way through
	the cluster of editors.


			The band just denied 90% of the story.
			It's a fabrication.

	Everyone looks at William, who is speechless and confused.
	Their congratulations stop on a dime.  The fact checker can't
	resist twisting the knife a little.

					FACT CHECKER 
			You weren't honest.  And worse, you
			wasted our time.





			Russell Hammond is the one who denied
			it.


				
			Crazy.


				
			We're going with the Who - !

	The kid has been sandbagged.  The machine of a big-time magazine
	whirs into action on another story, as the cluster moves down
	the hall.


 what did you
			expect?

	William sits there, as only David Felton stay behind,
	brandishing his cigarette-holder.  He sits down next to the
	kid.


			Well, I believe you.

	He looks at the kid, decides to offer a personal parable.

					FELTON 
			Jim Morrison once came to my house and
			drank a beer.  The beer is still on my
			mantle.  I'm 35 years old with Jim
			Morrison's beer as a shrine.  I wanted
			to be Earnest Hemingway.  Instead.  I
			have Jim Morrison's beer.
				(shrugs, he's learned to
			live with it)
			If you didn't make your story up, good
			for you.  If you good
			for you.

	The kid looks at him, too tired and still in shock.

					FELTON 
			Say something, so I know you're alive.


			Goodbye.

	He exits.


			Powerful  word.  Strong.  Final.



	Russell Hammond sits down on a plastic chair with a paper-plate
	filled with buffet-style food - steak and baked potato.
	Preoccupied, and several seats away from other crew members.
	He drinks a glass of milk.   Out old friend Sapphire takes the
	seat next to him, holding a skimpy paper plate of vegetables.


			I feel bad.


			Well, at least you feel.  That puts
			you in a higher class of asshole.

	They eat in silence.  Sapphire looks around.  The new breed of
	groupies eye her, as they cruise Russell on the periphery.
	They're bolder, flashier.  She eyes them back with seniority.


			What did I do?


			Well - you can do what the big boys
			do.
				
			Nothing.


			Yeah.

	The girls still circle Russell nearby.  He's unaware.


			You believe these new girls?  None of
			'em take birth control, and they eat
			all the steak.

	She looks sadly at her plate of vegetables.  An ever-sharp
	mind in last night's clothes, she commands Russell's respect.

					SAPPHIRE 
			They don't even know what it id to be
			a fan!  To blindly love some silly
			piece of music... or some band so much
			that it  please,  they're all
			just after the money.  Shoo --
				
			Go rob a bank!  It's more honest!


			Is Penny okay?


			The Quaalude Incident.  Yeah, it wasn't
			pretty.  She could have died.  I always
			warned her about letting too many guys
			fall in love with her.  I guess I was
			wrong.
				
			On of 'em saved her life.

	Russell nods.


			Well, it's finally over with Leslie.
			I'm going to call her.


			Let her retire.
				
			You want to lock her up in a house in
			Michigan?  
				
			Write her a song someday.  She deserves
			it.  Something about that girl brought
			out the best in a lot of...
				
			... pretty average people.  She deserves
			it...

	Russell stares into his crew meal, nodding a little.

					SAPPHIRE 
				
			... because something tells me twenty
			years from now, we'll remember her...
			and 

	Russell smiles to himself, knows it's true.  Dick passes,
	placing hands on Russell's shoulders, massaging a little.


			Have a good vacation.  I hope the band
			stays together.  Before it all went
			down the shitter, it was starting to
			get really good.

	Dick claps Russell on the back, and moves on.  He turns to
	Sapphire.


			I'm not going to blame myself.  I do
			make people happy.  They just shouldn't
			get to know me... 'cause it appears to
			spoil everything.


			Don't be so easy on yourself.


			What gives you the right to get this
			personal with me.


			Let's not reminisce.



	William moves like a zombie through the airport, and collapses
	in a seat.  He sits still in the crowded flow of human traffic.
	A cluster of Flight Attendants pass.  One stops, a stylish young
	woman wearing a tall bubble-shaped PSA hat with swirling colors.


			William?

	He looks at her.  He feels like he's on Mars, and she looks
	like a Martian.

					ANITA 
			You guys this is my 


				
			"The "

	William looks woefully at them, like a dog who's been hit by a
	car.


			You guys, I'll deadhead back later.  I
			think I'm needed.


			Nice to finally meet you.


			You have a good day!

	Anita looks in her brother's face.



			You're living your   You're finally
			free of... her.


			Yeah.


			Hey.  I'll take off work.  Let's have
			an adventure together.  You and me,
			finally.  Anywhere you want to go.
			Anywhere in the world.



	William whistles the family whistle.  Sister and brother trudge
	up the steps.


			This is not my idea of a good time.


			Just get me to my bed.


				
			I'll deal with her.

	William whistles again.  Mom meets them at the door.  She looks
	at her trashed son who has finally come home.  For the first
	time, she hugs Anita first, and it's not lost on Anita.

	It's a clumsy neck-hug, neither wanting to commit.  The kid
	passes to his Mother's left, with suitcase, intentionally
	nudging her into his sister.  Anita takes this as an aggressive
	act of love, and hugs her mother back.  Tears stream down Mom's
	face.  Their cheeks touch. Mom pulls away, and sees her own
	tears on Anita's face.  Thinking that she's also crying, she
	grabs a tissue for them both.



	The kid stands in the hallway listening, shaking his head,
	poised to enter his room, unseen by them.


				
			What are we going to do about him?


			I don't know.  Whatever happened to him, I
			just wish it could have happened to me.


			The magazine killed his story.

	Now they really hug, Anita gulping back real tears.  William
	watches them bonding over the oddest thing - his failure.
	William goes into the bedroom, the final three feet to sleep,
	and shuts the door.  A hand places a hotel sign on the door -
	DO NOT DISTURB.  Slight push in.



	He collapses with all his clothes on, almost instantly asleep.  His
	walls, just as he left them, boast a pantheon of rock heroes...
	with a very lonely Abraham Lincoln   in the center.



	The elevator doors ding open, and out walks Russell Hammond.
	The Secretary has just finished answering the phone, "Straight
	Arrow Publishers."  She puts the caller on hold.


			Hi, I'm Russel Hammond.


			You're here regarding?


			My life.



	Russell stands with the editors, observing the fine portraits
	on the walls.  He's behind enemy lines, and he knows it.
	Everything in the room fascinates him.


			I don't care what happens.  I don't
			care if you put us on the cover.  But
			you sent us a kid and... and he was a
			fan.   And we all made friends with
			him - absolutely, to get a good story.
			But then we actually liked him.  We
			thought he's... show us our lives in
			some mythic way and I guess... we're
			not mythic.  We panicked.


			You denied most of the story.


			Yeah, well, here's the problem with
			the truth.  It's too  -


			Well, we appreciate the visit.  The
			last time an artist came here, it was
			Buddy Miles and he punched me.


			I'm not punching anybody.  I am
			personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a
			voyage of self-reinvention.  This is
			about William Miller.
				
			He lives with us, he lost his virginity,
			he saw us at our worst, appreciated
			our best, he saved two lives, including
			mine... he smuggled about a half-pound
			of pot into Boston, and we never even
			told him -

	Nearby, David Felton looks at another editor, raising an
	eyebrow.

					RUSSELL 
			-- we told him too much, we told him
			everything...  He almost died with us
			over Tupelo... if the band survives
			him, it'll be a miracle... but you
			know, he tried to keep up, and that's
			a journalist to me.


			It's too late.  We're going with a
			different cover.


				
			Thank God.

	But Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead
	legendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of
	them, a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin.  A second thought.

					RUSSELL 
			You tell me it's too late.  But I could
			go back to my hotel room and... and
			O.D. tonight and something tells me
			you'd  to put me on the cover
			of the next issue.  Am I right?

	He looks at their faces.  They cannot disagree.

					RUSSELL 
			I'm learning the game.
				
			We fucked up.  We made friends with him.


			Next time we'll all be more
			professional.


			Maybe so.
				
			But God forbid, the day comes when
			selling yourself is as important as
			the music you make.
				(rueful, to Hendrix on the
			wall)
			You might have died at the right time,
			my friend.


			Thank you for visiting.  Good luck.


			Do what you want, but the story is
			true.



	at the entrance.  Raises his hand.

					RUSSELL 
			Good evening!



	Russell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go.
	Oddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to
	speak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a
	music of its own.  It's a beautiful and compelling "silence."
	He thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath
	of life.  His head filling again with the music of the world,
	he begins to walk down the street.  Very naturally, and quite
	randomly, he is noticed by young passersby.  They can't help
	it.  He looks like a star.  They can't quite figure out who it
	is, but it's  and they begin to follow him down the
	street.   Unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought,
	a small crowd begins to form... following him.



	A quiet kitchen.  Anita has been cooking.  A substantial
	breakfast has been placed on the table.  Sausage, orange
	juice... and now Anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with
	syrup and butter, in front of her mother.  William watches his
	mother facing an old enemy - white sugar.


			They're called pancakes.  Who knows
			when we'll be together again.  Splurge.
			It's what most people call breakfast.

	Mom looks at her children, and takes a breath.


			I went through your records.  And I
			found a song to play for you.

	She goes to the stereo and puts on a record.  The two children
	eye each other - what's coming next?  
	The two kids eye each other again.  Self-consciously avoiding
	their gaze, Mom sits and toys with her breakfast.  It's a song
	she clearly wants them to hear.  It's a song from the heart.
	They look at her, amazed.  Elaine looks up, regards her family.
	Somehow they're back at this table.  They continue eating
	breakfast.



	Bam.  A bundle of bound  Magazines lands on the
	newsstand pavement with a thud.  Someone reaches in to cut the
	cord, as the magazines puff up into view.  It's the new issue,
	with Russell Hammond on the cover.  The title: Stillwater Runs
	Deep.  Just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in
	the racks.



	Music segues to Led Zeppelin's "Four Sticks."  Penny Lane's
	sleeping Polaroid shots of our characters, featuring a few
	self-portraits.
